Since many patients failing RAL/EVG are given DTG as part of rescue therapy, and given that the N155H substitution often is found in combination with other compensatory resistance mutations in such individuals, we investigated the effects of multiple such substitutions within integrase (IN) on each of integrase function, HIV-1 infectivity, and levels of drug resistance.""

Evidence: The paper does not explicitly state the number of individuals.

Rationale: The paper does not provide enough information to determine the number of individuals.

Answer: Not reported

**Question 6: From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?**

Evidence: The paper does not explicitly state the country of origin.

Rationale: The paper does not provide enough information to determine the country of origin.

Answer: Not reported

**Question 7: From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?**

Evidence: The paper does not explicitly state the year of sample collection.

Rationale: The paper does not provide enough information to determine the year of sample collection.

Answer: Not reported

**Question 8: Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?**

Evidence: The paper does not explicitly state whether samples were cloned prior to sequencing.

Rationale: The paper does not provide enough information to determine whether samples were cloned prior to sequencing.

Answer: Not reported

**Question 9: Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?**

Evidence: The paper mentions ""CA"" and ""RT"" genes.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that the CA and RT genes were sequenced.

Answer: CA, RT

**Question 10: What method was used for sequencing?**

Evidence: The paper does not explicitly state the sequencing method.

Rationale: The paper does not provide enough information to determine the sequencing method.

Answer: Not reported

**Question 11: What type of samples were sequenced?**

Evidence: The paper mentions ""plasma"" samples.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that plasma samples were sequenced.

Answer: Plasma

**Question 12: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?**

Evidence: The paper mentions ""virological failure"" and ""treatment regimen"".

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that sequences were obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen.

Answer: Yes

**Question 13: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?**

Evidence: The paper does not explicitly state whether the patients were in a clinical trial.

Rationale: The paper does not provide enough information to determine whether the patients were in a clinical trial.

Answer: Not reported

**Question 14: Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?**

Evidence: The paper mentions ""ARV drugs"" and ""treatment regimen"".

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that sequences were obtained from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs.

Answer: Yes

**Question 15: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?**

Evidence: The paper mentions ""NRTI"" and ""INSTI"" drug classes.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that individuals received NRTI and INSTI drug classes before sample sequencing.

Answer: NRTI, INSTI

**Question 16: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?**

Evidence: The paper mentions ""lenacapavir"" and ""raltegravir"".

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that individuals received lenacapavir and raltegravir before sample sequencing.

Answer: Lenacapavir, Raltegravir",66
