Heuristics to decide if the paper reports HIV sequences from patient samples:

- If the paper states viral RNA/DNA was extracted from “plasma,” “serum,” “PBMC,” “buffy coat,” or “dried blood spots (DBS)” from “patients/participants/subjects/cohorts/blood donors,” then consider Yes.
- If phrases like “genotypic resistance testing,” “HIV-1 pol/gag/env/RT/PR/IN sequencing,” “single-genome amplification/sequencing,” “near full-length genome (NFLG),” “whole genome sequencing (WGS),” or “ultra-deep/MiSeq/Illumina/Sanger sequencing” are done on patient samples, then consider Yes.
- If patient-derived sequences/isolates are described with “ViroSeq,” “TRUGENE,” “Monogram/GeneSeq,” “Stanford HIVdb,” “in-house genotyping,” or “GeneScan” on clinical samples, then consider Yes.
- If recombinant viruses/vectors were made by inserting patient-derived Gag/Protease/Pol/Env/V3 sequences into lab backbones (e.g., NL4-3), or “patient-derived” integrase coding regions were used for phenotyping, then consider Yes.
- If the paper reports “GenBank accession numbers” for sequences generated in this study or states sequences were “submitted/deposited,” then consider Yes.
- If text mentions cohorts with ART-naïve/experienced patients, “baseline and virologic failure (VF)” sampling, “transmitted drug resistance (TDR)/surveillance DR,” or “longitudinal samples” with sequencing results/mutations, then consider Yes.
- If clinical isolates were derived from patient plasma and characterized genotypically/phenotypically (mutations listed), then consider Yes.
- If HIV-2 patient sequences (protease/RT/integrase/gp105) or HIV from specific risk groups (PWID/MSM, children, blood donors) were sequenced, then consider Yes.

Indications for No:

- If only laboratory strains/molecular clones/site-directed mutants are used (e.g., IIIB, NL4-3, HXB2/HXB2D, ROD/ROD9) without patient-derived sequencing, then consider No.
- If work is limited to recombinant enzymes/biochemical/tissue-culture assays without clinical sampling, then consider No.
- If it’s a review/meta-analysis or solely analyzes sequences downloaded from databases (GenBank/Stanford) without generating new patient-derived sequences in this study, then consider No.
- If only clinical outcomes/pharmacokinetics are discussed and no sequencing/genotyping of patient samples is described, then consider No.
- If “genotypic analysis” is mentioned without specifying sequencing of patient samples or methods/sources, be cautious; require explicit patient-sample sequencing evidence.

Always confirm that sequencing/genotyping was performed on samples collected from study participants and not solely on lab strains or previously published datasets.
