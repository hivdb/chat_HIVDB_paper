Use these if-then cues to decide if samples were cloned prior to sequencing:

Cloning explicitly performed (answer Yes):
- If text states “amplicons were cloned and sequenced,” “all products were cloned before Sanger sequencing,” “TA cloning/Topo TA cloning was performed,” or cites a cloning kit (e.g., NEB PCR cloning kit), then consider Yes.
- If “clonal analyses” or “clonal sequencing” of patient-derived amplicons/plasma is described (e.g., clone-level integrase genotypes), then consider Yes.
- If “infectious molecular clone,” “transmitted/founder molecular clones,” or “PCR product was cloned into a vector and then sequenced,” then consider Yes.

Direct, non-cloned sequencing (answer No):
- If phrases include “direct sequencing,” “sequenced directly,” “population-based,” “bulk/consensus sequencing,” “primer walking,” or “both strands directly sequenced,” then consider No.
- If standard clinical genotyping platforms are used (e.g., ViroSeq, TruGene, GeneSeqR, GenoSure, Abbott/ABI BigDye/3130/3500/3730 analyzers), then consider No.
- If “nested PCR/sequencing,” “RT-PCR followed by Sanger,” or “direct sequencing of PCR amplicons” is described, then consider No.
- If NGS is used on amplicons/libraries without cloning terms (Illumina MiSeq/HiSeq/454/GS Junior; “captured libraries,” “molecular barcodes/UMIs”), then consider No.
- If “single-genome amplification (SGA),” “single-proviral sequencing (SPS),” “near full-length single-template,” or “limiting dilution for direct sequencing” is used, then consider No.
- If explicitly “clonal sequencing was not conducted,” then consider No.

Not reported/Not applicable:
- If only in vitro/site-directed mutagenesis, recombinant enzymes, or plasmid constructs are sequenced (not patient samples), then consider Not reported for clinical cloning.
- If methods lack sequencing details, or sequences are imported from databases/other labs without cloning detail, then consider Not reported.
- If the study reports resistance/clinical outcomes without describing sequencing workflow, then consider Not reported.

Always confirm terms in the paper’s Methods/Results to validate the inference.
