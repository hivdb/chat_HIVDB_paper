Use these if-then cues to decide if any sequences came from individuals with virological failure on treatment:

Failure explicitly stated
- If the paper says “virologic/virological failure (VF)” or “failing therapy/regimen” (e.g., failing NNRTI/PI/INSTI, “salvage regimen”), then consider Yes.
- If it cites “confirmed/protocol-defined virologic failure (CVF/PDVF),” “clinical failure,” or “incomplete viral suppression,” then consider Yes.

On-ART viremia thresholds and timing
- If sequences/genotyping were done for participants with VL >1000 copies/mL (or >400) while on ART or at week X on ART, then consider Yes.
- If VF is defined as VL >50 or >400 copies/mL after specified time on ART and samples at that time were sequenced, then consider Yes.
- If terms like “not virally suppressed on ART,” “viremic on ART,” “viral rebound while on therapy,” or “unsuppressed while treated” appear with sequencing, then consider Yes.

Resistance testing at failure
- If “genotypic resistance testing/sequencing at time of VF/failure” or “resistance testing performed for participants meeting VF criteria” is reported, then consider Yes.
- If “treatment-emergent resistance,” “emergence of resistance mutations during regimen,” or “switch due to failure” is linked to sequenced samples, then consider Yes.

Populations implying failure
- If cohorts are “suspected of failing,” “second-line” due to failure, “salvage,” or “children/adults failing first-line,” with sequencing, then consider Yes.

No (not from failures)
- If all sampled individuals are “ART/ARV/drug-naïve,” “before/at ART initiation,” “pre-ART/pre-treatment,” “newly diagnosed/primary/acute infections,” “blood donors,” or “transmitted resistance surveillance,” then consider No.
- If sequences are from virally suppressed on ART, elite controllers, or off-ART during ATI without on-treatment failure, then consider No.
- If data are in vitro (site-directed mutants, lab strains, recombinant enzymes) or reviews without patient failure sourcing, then consider No.

Not reported/unclear
- If only “ARV-experienced/on ART at sampling” is stated without viremia/failure, or mixed cohorts without clear VF status, then consider Not reported.

Always confirm phrasing, timing (on ART), and whether sequencing occurred at/after failure in the paper text.
