Instruction: Identify the calendar years when the sequenced samples were obtained. Use these if-then cues:

Direct sample collection
- If the paper says “samples/plasma/PBMC/blood were collected between/from <Month/Year> to <Month/Year>,” then extract that year range (e.g., “between June 2004 and April 2007” → 2004–2007).
- If it lists per-year counts (“collected in 2008, 2009, 2010…”) then report the full span (e.g., 2008–2017) or discrete sets if non-contiguous.
- If months only (e.g., “March–September 2008”), then the year is that single year (2008).

Sequencing/generation timing
- If “sequences were generated/obtained/analyzed between <years>,” then use that range as the sample years.
- If “archived/stored plasma drawn over <years>” and then sequenced, use those draw years.

Enrollment/diagnosis tied to baseline sampling
- If “enrolled between <years>” and baseline genotyping/sequencing was done at enrollment, use those years.
- If “diagnosed between <years>” and “baseline sequences” or “all baseline sequences” were included, use the diagnosis range.

Study descriptors implying sampling period
- If “cross-sectional study conducted between <years>,” and samples were collected during the survey, use that range.
- If “retrospective analysis of samples collected <years>,” use that range.
- If “randomized between <years>” with baseline samples/sequences, use that period.

Multiple datasets/time points
- If multiple cohorts or periods are listed (e.g., 2002–2003 and 2007–2009), report them as separate ranges or the union if contiguous.
- If “since <year>” to “as of <year>,” report <year>–<year>.
- If specific time points (e.g., 1997, 2011, 2019), list them.

Exclusions/ambiguity
- If only follow-up duration is given without calendar years, do not infer years.
- If it’s a review/uses GenBank/other studies without new sampling years, answer “Not reported.”
- Do not use publication years or trial end dates unless explicitly tied to sample collection.

Always verify the extracted years against the paper text describing when samples or sequences were actually obtained.
