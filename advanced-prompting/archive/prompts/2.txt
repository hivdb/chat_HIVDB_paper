Instruction: Decide if the paper reports in vitro drug susceptibility data.

Rules:
- If the paper states “phenotypic susceptibility,” “phenotypic resistance testing,” or “drug susceptibility assay,” then consider Yes.
- If methods/results report IC50, EC50, EC90, fold-change (FC) in susceptibility, dose–response curves, or “hypersusceptibility/reduced susceptibility,” then consider Yes.
- If assays use named platforms like PhenoSense (HIV/Integrase/GT), Antivirogram, GenoSure/PhenoSense Gag-Pro, or Monogram/Virco phenotyping on study samples, then consider Yes.
- If cell-based susceptibility assays are described (e.g., TZM-bl, MAGIC-5, MT-2, PBMCs, SupT1, CEM-ss, HeLa-CD4, HEK293) with drug titrations and reporter readouts (luciferase, p24, RT activity), then consider Yes.
- If the study uses recombinant/pseudotyped/site-directed mutant viruses or patient-derived clones and tests antiviral activity in vitro against drugs (including “single-cycle,” “multiple-cycle,” “spreading infection” assays), then consider Yes.
- If in vitro enzymatic inhibition assays (e.g., integrase enzyme IC50s) or resistance passage/selection experiments with subsequent phenotypic susceptibility measures are reported, then consider Yes.
- If commercial lab phenotypes on the cohort/cases (e.g., “clonal phenotyping,” “Monogram phenotyping,” “fold-change to DTG/RAL/EVG/ETR/NVP/EFV/PI”) are presented, then consider Yes.
- If the paper aggregates/analyzes a dataset of in vitro susceptibility test results (even secondarily), then consider Yes.
- If only genotypic resistance, mutation prevalence, or algorithmic/predicted susceptibility (Stanford HIVdb, ANRS, Rega, Geno2pheno, WHO SDRM/CPR) is reported without lab phenotyping, then consider No.
- If the study focuses on sequencing, phylogenetics, recombination, epidemiology, surveillance, prevalence of TDR/SDRM, or transmission clusters without drug titration assays, then consider No.
- If only replication capacity/fitness assays are done without drugs, then consider No.
- If only tropism phenotyping (e.g., Trofile R5/X4) is reported, not drug susceptibility, then consider No.
- If only clinical outcomes, pharmacokinetics/drug levels, or case descriptions without in vitro susceptibility metrics, then consider No.
- If in vitro selection/passaging is described but no susceptibility metrics (IC50/EC50/FC) are provided, then consider No.

Always confirm language and metrics in Methods/Results to validate the determination against the paper.
