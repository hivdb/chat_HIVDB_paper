Use these if-then heuristics to decide the sequenced sample type(s):

Plasma
- If text says “viral RNA was extracted from plasma,” “blood plasma,” “stored/archived/cryopreserved plasma,” or “plasma specimens/samples,” then consider Plasma.
- If methods mention “plasma HIV-1 RNA” with RT-PCR/sequencing/genotyping (e.g., ViroSeq, TRUGENE, PhenoSense, GeneSeq, Abbott m2000, NucliSENS, QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit), then consider Plasma.
- If sequencing at “baseline,” “screening,” “virologic failure (VF/CVF/PDVF),” or “rebound” uses plasma VL thresholds (≥400–1000 copies/mL) or “integrase sequences amplified from patient plasma,” then consider Plasma.
- If “plasma-derived” sequences or “recombinant viruses encoding plasma-derived” gene regions are described, then consider Plasma.

PBMC (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells)
- If “PBMC,” “peripheral blood mononuclear cells,” “proviral DNA,” “cell-associated DNA/RNA,” “CD4+ T cell subsets,” “leukapheresis,” or “PBMC DNA” were amplified/sequenced, then consider PBMC.
- If “whole-virus isolation from PBMCs,” “NFL proviral sequencing,” or “single-proviral sequencing from PBMC DNA,” then consider PBMC.

Whole blood
- If “DNA extracted from whole blood” with sequencing/genotyping, then consider Whole blood.
- If nucleic acids extracted from “plasma or whole blood” and DNA from whole blood was sequenced, then consider Whole blood (and Plasma if both).

Serum
- If “serum” (e.g., “blood serum”) used for RNA extraction/genome amplification, then consider Serum.

DBS (Dried Blood Spots)
- If “dried blood spots,” “DBS,” or WHO DBS protocols were used for genotyping/sequencing, then consider DBS.

Buffy coat
- If “buffy coat” samples were the source for sequencing, then consider Buffy coat.

Lymph node/gut tissue
- If “LNMCs/lymph node mononuclear cells” or “gut tissue” CD4+ T-cell DNA was sequenced, then consider Lymph node or Gut, respectively.

Multiple types
- If paper explicitly sequences from more than one (e.g., Plasma and PBMC; Plasma and DBS), report all mentioned types.

Not reported
- If only in vitro work (cell culture selections, site-directed mutagenesis, recombinant enzymes/clones) or database-only analyses without patient specimen sourcing, then consider Not reported.
- If VL measurement alone is reported without sequencing source, do not infer; mark Not reported unless sequencing source is specified.

Always confirm phrasing in the paper’s Methods/Results to validate the inferred sample type(s).
