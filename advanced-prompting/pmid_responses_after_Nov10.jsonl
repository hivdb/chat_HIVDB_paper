{"pmid": "37632071", "response": "Here's the information extracted and formatted as requested:\n\n```\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\n\nEvidence: The study describes a cohort of experienced PLWH who were switched to the drug combination BIC/FTC/TAF from other antiretroviral regimens. However, there is no mention of HIV genetic sequencing or specific samples taken for sequencing.\n\nRationale: Upon reviewing the paper, while it discusses patient cohorts and the effectiveness of the treatment, it does not explicitly state that genetic sequencing was performed on HIV sequences from patient samples.\n\nAnswer: No\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\n\nEvidence: The study focuses on the effectiveness of the treatment regimen BIC/FTC/TAF in maintaining undetectable viral loads and discusses virological outcomes but does not detail any in vitro drug susceptibility assays or phenotypic resistance testing.\n\nRationale: The paper does not mention any assays, IC50 values, or susceptibility data related to drug responses; instead, it concentrates on clinical outcomes and virological responses, meaning no direct evaluation of drug susceptibility is reported.\n\nAnswer: No\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?\n\nEvidence: There are no statements in the paper regarding the deposition of any sequences in databases such as GenBank, nor are there any accession numbers

available.\n\nAnswer: No\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not provide any GenBank accession numbers or references to specific sequences deposited in public databases.\n\nRationale: Since the paper does not report on any sequences or provide accession numbers, it is not possible to extract any specific GenBank accession numbers from the text.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The paper presents data on a cohort of 197 PLWH but does not specify that samples were collected for HIV sequencing.\n\nRationale: Although the study discusses patient demographics and treatment responses, it does not report on the collection of samples or the number of individuals with samples specifically obtained for sequencing.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\nEvidence: The study was conducted in Italy, as it lists several Italian Infectious Diseases Units as participating centers.\n\nRationale: The paper explicitly names Italian cities where

clearly stated in the paper, thus providing the years during which the samples are from.\n\nAnswer: 2019–2022\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not mention any procedures involving cloning of samples for sequencing.\n\nRationale: Since the paper does not use terms related to cloning or provide details about how sequencing was prepared, it indicates that no cloning was performed.\n\nAnswer: No\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not report any specific genes or regions of the HIV genome that were sequenced.\n\nRationale: There is no mention of genotyping, specific genes analyzed, or regions sequenced in the context of patient samples, which suggests that this information is not provided in the study.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: What method was used for sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not detail any specific sequencing method employed in the study.\n\nRationale: The lack of information on sequencing methodology indicates that no methods related to sequencing are described in the manuscript.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: What type of samples were sequenced?\n\nEvidence: The paper predominantly discusses the treatment regimen and outcomes without mentioning specific types of samples that were sequenced.\n\nRationale: There is no information contained in the text regarding the nature of the samples taken for sequencing, implying that this crucial data is missing.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not discuss any individuals that experienced virological failure or relate sample sequencing to those outcomes.\n\nRationale: The absence of any discussion on virological failure samples suggests that none were reported, thus indicating no sequences from such individuals.\n\nAnswer: No\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\n\nEvidence: The study describes a retrospective cohort analysis without indicating that the patients were part of any clinical trial.\n\nRationale: The research is characterized as observational and does not indicate a clinical trial setting or registration number typically associated with trials.\n\nAnswer: No\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?\n\nEvidence: The study addresses experienced PLWH who had been switched to BIC/FTC/TAF but does not mention sequences derived from these individuals.\n\nRationale: While the participants were indeed previously treated, the absence of any sequencing report prevents a positive affirmation regarding sequences from ARV drug recipients.\n\nAnswer: No\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The paper indicates that the majority of patients were on previous ART but does not specify particular drug classes they had received.\n\nRationale: No specific
