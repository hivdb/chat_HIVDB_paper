The addition of R262K to H51Y decreases HIV-1 susceptibility to DTG. To further characterize the R262K secondary substitution in the presence of H51Y, we performed resistance assays using TZM-bl cells and various concentrations of DTG or RAL ( Fig. 4 ), which generated EC 50 s for each virus as well as fold change (FC) values ( Table 2 ). Although the primary H51Y substitution did not confer resistance against DTG or RAL (FC values of 1.25 and 0.98, respectively), consistent with previous results ( 11 ), the addition of R262K did result in low-level but significant biochemical resistance to DTG but not to RAL (FC values of 1.9 and 0.92, respectively).""","The paper includes in vitro drug susceptibility data, specifically examining the susceptibility of HIV-1 to dolutegravir (DTG) and raltegravir (RAL) using short-term resistance assays with TZM-bl cells.",Yes

An 18-year-old male patient was commenced on ART in September 2010, at seven years of age. His baseline CD4 count was 145 cells/μL. His first-line ART regimens were stavudine/lamivudine (3TC)/nevirapine, followed by stavudine/3TC/efavirenz (EFV), followed by zidovudine/3TC/EFV. Viral load (VL) results were not available until 2014, at which time he was noted to have virological treatment failure. An HIV genotypic resistance test done in January 2015 showed significant nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) DRMs with no protease inhibitor resistance (see Table 1 for DRMs and sensitivity results). In January 2015 he was switched to second-line treatment with abacavir (ABC)/3TC/lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), which was later simplified to ABC/3TC/Atazanavir/ritonavir (ATZ/r). Virological suppression was maintained for the duration of protease inhibitor therapy. In August 2019 he was switched to a single tablet regimen of tenofovir (TDF)/3TC/DTG; his VL was suppressed at the time of switch.
Case 2
A 29-year-old female patient was diagnosed with HIV infection in June 2017 and commenced on TDF/3TC/EFV. Her baseline CD4 count and VL are unknown. Three years later, she was switched to ABC/3TC/ATZ/r following virological failure. Four weeks after treatment switch, she developed pulmonary tuberculosis and in error was given rifampicin with ATZ/r for two months. For treatment optimisation reasons, the ART regimen was switched to ABC/3TC/DTG, but DTG was dosed at 50 mg daily with rifampicin for four months instead of twice daily according to current guidelines. The VL at switch to ABC/3TC/DTG is unknown. The clinical response to treatment was poor and she was referred to Newlands Clinic. A VL taken after seven months on ABC/3TC/DTG was 6540 copies/mL, despite adherence counselling.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was added for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis. Repeat genotyping at M61 showed wild-type virus. She continued to be prescribed BIC/TAF/FTC with ongoing viraemia due to poor adherence. At M79, her CD4 count was 166 cells/μL (11%), viral load was 4288 copies/mL, and genotypic resistance testing captured new reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations: T69D/N, K70E, and T215I, but she could not be contacted to switch her regimen. She discontinued BIC/TAF/FTC on her own at M82 upon learning she was pregnant. She restarted treatment with DTG + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/FTC at M84, before being intensified to darunavir (DRV) + ritonavir (RTV) + DTG + TDF/FTC when diagnosed with cerebral toxoplasmosis at M85. After delivery, she started DTG + rilpivirine (RPV)/TAF/FTC to reduce pill burden but did not achieve virological suppression and died of hypoxemic respiratory failure at M86. She experienced an HIV RNA <40 copies/mL on initial therapy with lopinavir/RTV + zidovudine/lamivudine (AZT/3TC). She then switched to atazanavir (ATV) + RTV + TDF/FTC for simplification at M25 but reported intermittent adherence and experienced episodes of breakthrough viraemia before stopping HIV therapy at M58. Genotyping at M65 revealed the V82I protease mutation along with several genetic polymorphisms in the protease gene (Table 1). To reduce pill burden, she was switched to single-tablet efavirenz (EFV)/TDF/FTC at M66. Following several treatment interruptions, she switched to elvitegravir/cobicistat/TDF/FTC (EVG/c/TDF/FTC) at M83 and was then lost to follow-up at M96. She restarted antiretroviral therapy (ART) with EVG/c/TAF/FTC at M141 but switched to BIC/TAF/FTC due to fatigue and dizziness at M148; viral load was 128 890 copies/mL and genotype showed wild-type virus. Her other medications were TMP-SMX and a multivitamin, dosed separately from her ART. Following virological success (HIV RNA <40 copies/mL) on BIC/TAF/FTC, she experienced breakthrough viraemia (HIV RNA 18 870 copies/mL) at M161 due to poor adherence.

He simplified the regimen to DRV/RTV alone at M9 before resuming DRV/RTV/TDF/FTC at M20 due to persistent low-level viraemia of 54–60 copies/mL between M16 and M18; viral load was <40 copies/mL at M22.
