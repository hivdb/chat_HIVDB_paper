Question: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?

Evidence: GS-9160 is a novel and potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase (IN) that specifically targets the process of strand transfer. It is an authentic inhibitor of HIV-1 integration, since treatment of infected cells results in an elevation of two-long terminal repeat circles and a decrease of integration junctions. GS-9160 has potent and selective antiviral activity in primary human T lymphocytes producing a 50% effective concentration (EC ~50~ ) of ∼2 nM, with a selectivity index (50% cytotoxic concentration/EC ~50~ ) of ∼2,000.

Question: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?

Evidence: The antiviral activity of GS-9160 was evaluated in HIV-1-infected MT-2 and MT-4 cell lines as well as in primary human T lymphocytes.
