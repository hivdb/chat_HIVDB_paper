## Question 16: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?

### Evidence
For case 1 (Fig. 3A and C), HIV-1 genotypic assays were performed prior to RAL-based therapy (baseline) and at three different time points in which the HIV-1 viral load (VL) rebounded. At baseline (#1, August 2005), during tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/lamivudine (3TC)/efavirenz (EFV) treatment, no primary INSTI resistance-associated mutations were detected. However, when the HIV-1 VL rebounded to 1000 copies/ml after switching to maraviroc (MVC)/RAL treatment, a primary RAL resistance mutation, N155H, appeared as a major variant (∼99.9% of the total viral population) between time points #2 and #4. In case 2, the HIV-1 VL rebounded to 100,000 copies/ml during TDF/emtricitabine (FTC)/RAL treatment (Fig. 3B and D).

### Rationale
The paper specifically mentions drugs as part of the treatment regimens received by two cases, Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), Lamivudine (3TC), Efavirenz (EFV), Maraviroc (MVC), Raltegravir (RAL), Emtricitabine (FTC)

29373677,"Question: 1. Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?

Evidence: ""The patient infected with a B subtype HIV-1 strain received an antiretroviral treatment including INSTIs from 2008 to 2015, a period during which CD4 counts had increased from 350 to 940 cells/mm^3^. The patient was first treated with raltegravir in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada) for 6 years until 2014, during which time the viral load remained undetectable (plasma HIV RNA <20 copies/mL). Every 6 months, during follow-up, genotypic analysis of integrase was tested in DNA and never showed any mutations selected against raltegravir. Owing to treatment intolerance, a simplification of treatment with dolutegravir monotherapy (not currently recommended in any guidelines for HIV-1 treatment) was proposed to the patient in 2014 while the viral load was still undetectable.""

Answer: Yes

Question: 2. Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?

Evidence: ""We first investigated the replicative properties of mutant viruses. The p24^gag^ production of these mutants was similar to the WT showing that none of these mutations impaired the late steps of viral replication (Figure 1 a, left panel and black columns). The early steps of HIV-1 replication were investigated by HeLa-P4 cell infection (Figure 1 a, left panel and grey columns). Interestingly, infectivity of the mutants was similar to the WT indicating that mutations identified in the patient do not impair the early steps of viral replication. The above-mentioned mutations could affect the 3′-processing and/or the strand-transfer reaction mediated by IN. Our cell-free reaction results demonstrate that the 3′-processing efficiency for all mutants was similar but significantly lower compared with the WT (an average of 50% of the WT, Figure 1 a middle panel and black columns). However, the strand-transfer efficiency was not affected by any mutations (Figure 1 a, middle panel and grey columns). Thus, all the mutations presented in this report slightly impair the 3′-processing but not the strand-transfer reaction. We performed resistance experiments using a 19-mer DNA (U5B-2) mimicking the 3′-processed DNA. The incubation for 2 h at 37°C, usually used, failed to reveal significant resistance to dolutegravir for any of the mutants (Figure 1 a, right panel).""

Rationale: The paper describes the process of antiviral testing against dolutegravir using recombinant viruses.

### Q2: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?

Question: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?

Evidence: ""The combination of H51Y and R262K substitutions slightly decreased susceptibility to DTG (fold change = 1.87) in cell-based resistance assays. HIV susceptibility to DTG and RAL was determined using short-term resistance assays with TZM-bl cells, as described previously (8). The addition of R262K to H51Y decreases HIV-1 susceptibility to DTG. To further characterize the R262K secondary substitution in the presence of H51Y, we performed resistance assays using TZM-bl cells and various concentrations of DTG or RAL ( Fig. 4 ), which generated EC 50 s for each virus as well as fold change (FC) values ( Table 2 ). Although the primary H51Y substitution did not confer resistance against DTG or RAL (FC values of 1.25 and 0.98, respectively), consistent with previous results ( 11 ), the addition of R262K did result in low-level but significant biochemical resistance to DTG but not to RAL (FC values of 1.9 and 0.92, respectively).""

## Questions

### Question 1: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?

Question: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?

Evidence: In this report, we describe a primary infected patient with HIV-1 harbouring TDRAMs [S230R (99%) and Q148R (1.9%)] affecting second-generation INSTIs, as DTG, cabotegravir (CAB) and bictegravir (BIC). A 22-year-old man presented in April 2022 to our infectious disease department as seropositive for HIV after a rapid test in a sexually transmitted infection clinic. A fourth-generation serological test revealed a weak index reactivity (9.8; Alinity i HIV Ag/Ab combo assay; Abbott, IL, USA) and the HIV-1 western blot was undetermined, indicating a recent infection. The last negative HIV serology was 3 months prior. Baseline CD4 T cell count was 577/mm^3^ and HIV-1 viral load was 2770 copies/mL. The patient was infected through homosexual contact and started on a dolutegravir (DTG) + emtricitabine (FTC) + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) regimen 7 days after diagnosis. His sexual partner was an HIV-1-infected man treated but experiencing difficulties in adherence to treatment. SBS of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), protease and integrase was performed before treatment initiation and revealed an S230R INSTI mutation. There were no other drug resistance mutations in the RT or protease genes. Due to the INSTI mutation, the patient was switched to a regimen containing doravirine + TDF + FTC. Viral load was <50 copies/mL 6 weeks after treatment initiation and remained undetectable 8 months later.

Rationale: The paper describes a primary infected patient with HIV-1 harbouring TDRAMs [S230R (99%) and Q148R (1.9%)] affecting second-generation INSTIs, as DTG, cabotegravir (CAB) and bictegravir (BIC). The patient was infected through homosexual contact and started on a dolutegravir (DTG) + emtricitabine (FTC) + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) regimen 7 days after diagnosis.

37358226,"## Question 1: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?

### Evidence:
The paper mentions that data were derived from the Viral Load Cohort North-East Lesotho (VICONEL), a prospective open cohort including all people receiving HIV viral load (VL) testing in Butha-Buthe or Mokhotlong district in Lesotho. The VICONEL database incorporates routine demographic and clinical data collected at the time of VL testing that are counterchecked by a dedicated data management team.

### Rationale:
The paper does not explicitly mention the sequencing of HIV sequences from patient samples. However, it does mention the collection of viral load (VL) testing data from participants in the VICONEL cohort. This suggests that the data may have been used for genotypic resistance testing or other analyses that involve sequencing of HIV sequences.

### Answer:
No

## Question 2: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?

### Evidence:
The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing or data.

### Rationale:
The paper focuses on the analysis of viral load (VL) outcomes and determinants thereof upon programmatic transitioning from NNRTI- to DTG-based ART among people with HIV in Lesotho. It does not report any in vitro drug susceptibility data.

### Answer:
No

## Question 3: Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?

### Evidence:
No evidence.

### Rationale:
The paper does not provide any information about the availability of the sequences used in the study.

### Evidence: 
""She initiated dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (DTG/ABC/3TC) 39 months after diagnosis (M39); however, because of intermittent adherence, she did not experience virological suppression and was subsequently switched to BIC/TAF/FTC because of the smaller pill size while admitted to hospital with esophagitis and a CD4 count of 62 cells/μL (6%) at M59. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was added for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis. Repeat genotyping at M61 showed wild-type virus. She continued to be prescribed BIC/TAF/FTC with ongoing viraemia due to poor adherence. At M79, her CD4 count was 166 cells/μL (11%), viral load was 4288 copies/mL, and genotypic resistance testing captured new reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations: T69D/N, K70E, and T215I, but she could not be contacted to switch her regimen. She discontinued BIC/TAF/FTC on her own at M82 upon learning she was pregnant. She restarted treatment with DTG + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/FTC at M84, before being intensified to darunavir (DRV) + ritonavir (RTV) + DTG + TDF/FTC when diagnosed with cerebral toxoplasmosis at M85. After delivery, she started DTG + rilpivirine (RPV)/TAF/FTC to reduce pill burden but did not achieve virological suppression and died of hypoxemic respiratory failure at M86. She experienced an HIV RNA <40 copies/mL on initial therapy with lopinavir/RTV + zidovudine/lamivudine (AZT/3TC). She then switched to atazanavir (ATV) + RTV + TDF/FTC for simplification at M25 but reported intermittent adherence and experienced episodes of breakthrough viraemia before stopping HIV therapy at M58. Genotyping at M65 revealed the V82I protease mutation along with several genetic polymorphisms in the protease gene (Table 1). To reduce pill burden, she was switched to single-tablet efavirenz (EFV)/TDF/FTC at M66. Following several treatment interruptions, she switched to elvitegravir/cobicistat/TDF/FTC (EVG/c/TDF/FTC) at M83 and was then lost to follow-up at M96. She restarted antiretroviral therapy (ART) with EVG/c/TAF/FTC at M141 but switched to BIC/TAF/FTC due to fatigue and dizziness at M148; viral load was 128 890 copies/mL and genotype showed wild-type virus. Her other medications were TMP-SMX and a multivitamin, dosed separately from her ART. Following virological success (HIV RNA <40 copies/mL) on BIC/TAF/FTC, she experienced breakthrough viraemia (HIV RNA 18 870 copies/mL) at M161 due to poor adherence. Genotyping showed an emergent M184I mutation. She subsequently switched to BIC/TAF/FTC plus DRV/c but has yet to achieve virological success. He initiated DRV/RTV/TDF/FTC at M5, when viral load was 2 437 253 copies/mL. He simplified the regimen to DRV/RTV alone at M9 before resuming DRV/RTV/TDF/FTC at M20 due to persistent low-level viraemia of 54–60 copies/mL between M16 and M18; viral load was <40 copies/mL at M22. At M80, viral load remained undetectable at <40 copies/mL, and at M83 he switched to BIC/TAF/FTC for simplification.""
