Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was added for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis. Repeat genotyping at M61 showed wild-type virus. She continued to be prescribed BIC/TAF/FTC with ongoing viraemia due to poor adherence. At M79, her CD4 count was 166 cells/μL (11%), viral load was 4288 copies/mL, and genotypic resistance testing captured new reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations: T69D/N, K70E, and T215I, but she could not be contacted to switch her regimen.

She restarted treatment with DTG + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/FTC at M84, before being intensified to darunavir (DRV) + ritonavir (RTV) + DTG + TDF/FTC when diagnosed with cerebral toxoplasmosis at M85. After delivery, she started DTG + rilpivirine (RPV)/TAF/FTC to reduce pill burden but did not achieve virological suppression and died of hypoxemic respiratory failure at M86.

She then switched to atazanavir (ATV) + RTV + TDF/FTC for simplification at M25 but reported intermittent adherence and experienced episodes of breakthrough viraemia before stopping HIV therapy at M58. Genotyping at M65 revealed the V82I protease mutation along with several genetic polymorphisms in the protease gene (Table 1). To reduce pill burden, she was switched to single-tablet efavirenz (EFV)/TDF/FTC at M66. Following several treatment interruptions, she switched to elvitegravir/cobicistat/TDF/FTC (EVG/c/TDF/FTC) at M83 and was then lost to follow-up at M96.
