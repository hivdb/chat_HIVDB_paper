### QID 2
Question: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?

Evidence: ""In vitro susceptibility was assessed through a phenotypic assay measuring fold-change values with respect to the reference NL4-3 virus. Genotypic susceptibility was computed by the Stanford HIVdb algorithm 8.9-1. Determination of the in vitro susceptibility to doravirine, rilpivirine and etravirine was determined in duplicate through a TZM-bl cell-based assay previously shown to correlate well with the reference phenotypic Phenosense Assay in the measurement of susceptibility to HIV-1 protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase inhibitors [22]. Briefly, 10 0 0 0 TZM-bl cells/well were infected with the wild-type NL4-3 strain or NNRTI-resistant viruses at multiplicity of infection of 0.03 in the presence of five-fold dilution of doravirine, rilpivirine (range 10 μM – 0.00512 nM) and etravirine (range 5 μM – 0.00256 nM). After 48 hours, cells were treated with the Glo-Lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay (Promega), then relative luminescence units were measured through the GloMax Discover instrument (Promega) and elaborated with GraphPad software to calculate half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. Fold-change (FC) values were calculated with respect to the IC50 value obtained with the NL4-3 wild-type strain. Viruses with FC > 100 were considered as FC = 100 for statistical analyses. To infer drug activity based on phenotypic FC values, available drug-specific cut-offs from Monogram Biosciences were considered including 3-fold and 2.5-fold as biological cut-offs for doravirine and rilpivirine, respectively, and 2.9-fold and 10-fold as the lower and upper clinical cut-offs for etravirine, respectively.""

Rationale: The paper reports in vitro drug susceptibility data using a TZM-bl cell-based assay. They measured the susceptibility of doravirine, rilpivirine, and etravirine against wild-type NL4-3 strain and NNRTI-resistant viruses. The assay involved determining half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values and calculating fold-change (FC) values with respect to the wild-type strain.

Direct comparisons show that MK-8591 is 10-fold more potent than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) ( 15 ), 10 to100 times more potent than zidovudine (AZT) ( 12, 14 ) and 1,000 times more potent than emtricitabine (FTC) ( 16 ) against HIV-1 in culture. MK-8591 also exhibits favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including a long intracellular half-life compared to those of conventional, FDA-approved NRTIs ( 16, -- 18 ). This property is attributable to the fluorine at the 2 position of the adenine base, which renders the compound resistant to degradation by adenosine deaminase ( 13, 14 ). MK-8591 suppresses HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication at clinically achievable concentrations in humanized mice and rhesus macaques, respectively ( 16, 19, -- 21 ). In a phase 1b proof-of-concept clinical trial, a single 10-mg dose of MK-8591 demonstrated antiviral activity for 10 days in ART-naive, HIV-1-infected participants ( 22 ). The *in vivo* potency, pharmacokinetic profile, and physical properties of MK-8591 open the possibility for once-weekly oral dosing, and studies of long-acting formulations of MK-8591 indicate that a single parenteral administration may provide HIV-1-suppressive levels of the drug for 6 months or longer ( 23 ). Thus, MK-8591 potentially represents a new ARV with multiple modalities for preventing and treating HIV-1 infection.""

Rationale: The paper mentions that MK-8591 is an investigational nucleoside analog that inhibits HIV-1 replication with 50% effective concentrations (EC ~50~ s) in the low nanomolar-to-picomolar range. This indicates that the study is about HIV-1, but it does not explicitly mention that the sequences were obtained from patient samples.

Answer: No

### Question 2: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?

Question: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?

Evidence: ""We initially compared the ability of MK-8591 to inhibit two prototypic isolates derived from full-length plasmid molecular clones: HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ and HIV-2 ~ROD9~. We have previously shown that these isolates exhibit comparable susceptibilities to FDA-approved NRTIs in the MAGIC-5A cell line, with EC ~50~ s that differ by 2-fold or less between the two strains ( 53 ). In the present study, we performed a total of 10 independent assay runs in which the sensitivity of HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ and HIV-2 ~ROD9~ to MK-8591 was tested head-to-head (e.g., Fig. 2A ). In these experiments, the mean EC ~50~ for HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ was 2.0 ± 0.6 nM. This result agrees with previously published measurements for HIV-1 in single-cycle assays (1.1 nM for HIV-1 ~BH10~ in MAGI cells \[ 14 \], 3.2 nM for HIV-1 ~NL101~ in TZM-bl cells \[ 15 \]). In contrast, within each assay run, the EC ~50~ for HIV-2 ~ROD9~ was lower than the corresponding value for HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ by a factor of 2.3 to 9.9 ( Fig. 2A and ​ andB). B ). Following additional determinations ( *n* = 14 total), the mean EC ~50~ for HIV-2 ~ROD9~ was 0.42 ± 0.12 nM ( Fig. 3A ). Thus, MK-8591 was 4.8-fold more active against HIV-2 ~ROD9~ than against HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ in the single-cycle assay.""

Rationale: The paper describes the results of in vitro drug susceptibility assays that assess the sensitivity of HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates to MK-8591.

29373677,"## Question 1: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?

### Evidence: 
""The patient infected with a B subtype HIV-1 strain received an antiretroviral treatment including INSTIs from 2008 to 2015, a period during which CD4 counts had increased from 350 to 940 cells/mm^3^. The patient was first treated with raltegravir in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada) for 6 years until 2014, during which time the viral load remained undetectable (plasma HIV RNA <20 copies/mL). Every 6 months, during follow-up, genotypic analysis of integrase was tested in DNA and never showed any mutations selected against raltegravir.

## Question 2: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?

### Evidence: 
""We first investigated the replicative properties of mutant viruses. The p24^gag^ production of these mutants was similar to the WT showing that none of these mutations impaired the late steps of viral replication (Figure 1 a, left panel and black columns). The early steps of HIV-1 replication were investigated by HeLa-P4 cell infection (Figure 1 a, left panel and grey columns). Interestingly, infectivity of the mutants was similar to the WT indicating that mutations identified in the patient do not impair the early steps of viral replication. The above-mentioned mutations could affect the 3′-processing and/or the strand-transfer reaction mediated by IN. Our cell-free reaction results demonstrate that the 3′-processing efficiency for all mutants was similar but significantly lower compared with the WT (an average of 50% of the WT, Figure 1 a middle panel and black columns). However, the strand-transfer efficiency was not affected by any mutations (Figure 1 a, middle panel and grey columns).""

35945163,"Here are the answers to the questions based on the provided paper content:

### Question 1: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?

**Question:** Question 1: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?

**Evidence:** ""Of the 2 patients with early virologic failure in the viremic group, 1 patient had a decrease in viral load less than 2 log ~10~ at the first maintenance injection (from 214 540 to 39 293 copies/mL). A nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutation (L100I) was present on genotypic testing at this time, and injections were discontinued. The patient had not chosen to initiate oral ART as of database closure, and additional genotypic testing showed a new Y181I mutation in the RT gene. Risk factors for failure were a V179V/I mutation in the RT gene at baseline and rifabutin use 2 weeks before initiation of LA CAB--RPV. The second patient with failure was also noted to have a decrease in viral load of less than 2 log ~10~ at the first maintenance injection (from 137 134 to 4371 copies/mL) and, although the HIV viral load at the third injection was less than 30 copies/mL, genotypic testing was successful and showed an E138K mutation in the RT gene and an R263K mutation in the integrase gene. The baseline genotype resistance test had a minor integrase strand transferase inhibitor (INSTI) mutation (T97A).""

**Rationale:** The paper mentions genotypic testing and reportted murationg, but did not mention to publish the sequences anywhere in the paper.

**Answer:** Yes

### Question 2: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?

**Question:** Question 2: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?

**Evidence:** ""The FLAIR study demonstrated noninferiority of monthly long-acting cabotegravir + rilpivirine versus daily oral dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine for maintaining virologic suppression. Three participants who received long-acting therapy had confirmed virologic failure (CVF) at Week 48, and all had HIV-1 that was originally classified as subtype A1 and contained the baseline integrase polymorphism L74I; updated classification algorithms reclassified all 3 as HIV-1 subtype A6. Retrospectively, the impact of L74I on in vitro sensitivity and durability of response to cabotegravir in HIV-1 subtype B and A6 backgrounds was studied. Site-directed L74I and mutations observed in participants with CVF were generated in HIV-1 subtype B and a consensus integrase derived from 3 subtype A6 CVF baseline sequences. Rilpivirine susceptibility was assessed in HIV-1 subtype B and A1 containing reverse transcriptase mutations observed in participants with CVF. HIV-1 subtype B L74I and L74I/G140R mutants and HIV-1 subtype A6 I74L and I74/G140R mutants remained susceptible to cabotegravir; L74I/Q148R double mutants exhibited reduced susceptibility in HIV-1 subtypes B and A6 (half maximal effective capacity fold change, 4.4 and 4.1, respectively). Reduced rilpivirine susceptibility was observed across HIV-1 subtypes B and A1 with resistance-associated mutations K101E or E138K (half maximal effective capacity fold change, 2.21 to 3.09). In cabotegravir breakthrough experiments, time to breakthrough was similar between L74 and I74 viruses across HIV-1 subtypes B and A6; Q148R was selected at low cabotegravir concentrations. Therefore, the L74I integrase polymorphism did not differentially impact in vitro sensitivity to cabotegravir across HIV-1 subtype B and A6 integrase genes (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02938520).""

Sequence reads (FASTQ files) were analyzed with VirVarSeq version 20140929, which calls variants at the codon level [27]. From the output, we extracted amino acid frequencies in the pol gene from amino acid position 1--935 where positions 1--99 encode protease protein, positions 100--659 encode reverse transcriptase protein, and positions 660--935 partially encode integrase protein (our amplicon did not cover positions 936--947) [25].""

```markdown
Question: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?

Evidence: A 29-year-old male patient was admitted with a right cervical mass associated with fever, dry cough, hyporexia, and myalgia for more than 2 weeks, as well as neurological symptoms of headache and sudden hemiparesis. A chest examination revealed bilateral crepitations, rhonchi, and wheezes. No other findings were noted during the physical examination. Cervical ultrasonography detected a large tumoral mass with ipsilateral adenomegaly. Computed tomography of the chest showed findings consistent with miliary TB or histoplasmosis. The MTB-RIF (GeneXpert ^Cepheid) and the rapid test for HIV were both positive. The baseline viral load (VL) was 437,927 cp/mL (Log = 5.64). A therapeutic regimen for TB (Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol), ART (TDF/3TC/DTG), the latter at a conventional dose of 50 mg/day, and empirical therapy against histoplasmosis were initiated.

Rationale: The paper describes the clinical case of an HIV/Tuberculosis coinfected patient who developed Human Immunodeficieny Virus (HIV) treatment failure during dolutegravir therapy.

Question: How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?

Evidence: A 29-year-old male patient was admitted with a right cervical mass associated with fever, dry cough, hyporexia, and myalgia for more than 2 weeks, as well as neurological symptoms of headache and sudden hemiparesis. A chest examination revealed bilateral crepitations, rhonchi, and wheezes. No other findings were noted during the physical examination. Cervical ultrasonography detected a large tumoral mass with ipsilateral adenomegaly. Computed tomography of the chest showed findings consistent with miliary TB or histoplasmosis. The MTB-RIF (GeneXpert ^Cepheid) and the rapid test for HIV were both positive. The baseline viral load (VL) was 437,927 cp/mL (Log = 5.64). A therapeutic regimen for TB (Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol), ART (TDF/3TC/DTG), the latter at a conventional dose of 50 mg/day, and empirical therapy against histoplasmosis were initiated.

Evidence: ""Sequences from resistance selection experiments have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers PP827803 -- PP828572.""
Rationale: The paper mentions that sequences from resistance selection experiments have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers PP827803 -- PP828572.
Answer: PP827803 -- PP828572

### QID 5
Question: How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?
Evidence: ""The combination of ISL with LEN more effectively suppressed viral breakthrough and demonstrated a higher barrier to the emergence of resistance than either compound on its own.""
Rationale: The paper does not mention the number of individuals who had samples obtained for HIV sequencing.
Answer: Not reported

### QID 6
Question: From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?
Evidence: ""No evidence""
Rationale: The paper does not mention the specific countries from which the sequenced samples were obtained.
Answer: Not reported

### QID 7
Question: From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?
Evidence: ""No evidence""
Rationale: The paper does not provide specific years for when the sequenced samples were obtained.
Answer: Not reported

### QID 8
Question: Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?
Evidence: ""HIV-1 site-directed mutants (SDMs) either were constructed in a pGEM vector encompassing the RT and protease (PR) coding sequences of HIV-1 HXB2 by using the QuikChange SDM kit (Stratagene, CA) or were obtained from a commercial supplier (Eurofins Medigenomix GmbH, Martinsried, Germany).""
Rationale: The paper describes the construction of HIV-1 site-directed mutants in a pGEM vector, which is not about molecular cloning.
Answer: No

### QID 9
Question: Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?
Evidence: ""The CA or RT-encoding region was amplified by the one-step RT-PCR method. PCR products were genotyped by an automated population-based full-length sequencing method (covering amino acids 1--231 of the CA region and 1--440 of the RT region).""
Rationale: The paper mentions the sequencing of the CA and RT genes.
Answer: CA, RT

### QID 10
Question: What method was used for sequencing?
Evidence: ""PCR products were genotyped by an automated population-based full-length sequencing method (covering amino acids 1--231 of the CA region and 1--440 of the RT region).""
Rationale: The paper mentions the use of an automated population-based full-length sequencing method, which is a type of Sanger sequencing.
Answer: Sanger sequencing

### QID 11
Question: What type of samples were sequenced?
Evidence: ""The combination of ISL with LEN more effectively suppressed viral breakthrough and demonstrated a higher barrier to the emergence of resistance than either compound on its own.""
Rationale: The paper does not specify the type of samples that were sequenced.
Answer: Not reported

### QID 12
Question: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?
Evidence: ""Postbaseline resistance was evaluated in participants experiencing virologic failure. Resistance testing was performed for any participant meeting virologic failure (VF) criteria.""
Rationale: The paper mentions that resistance testing was performed for participants experiencing virologic failure.
Answer: Yes

### QID 13
Question: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?
Evidence: ""Study GS-US-200-4625 (CAPELLA) is an ongoing phase 2/3 clinical study evaluating LEN in combination with an OBR in ARV treatment-experienced PWH with MDR.""
Rationale: The paper describes the CAPELLA study as an ongoing phase 2/3 clinical study.
Answer: Yes

### QID 14
Question: Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?
Evidence: ""Study GS-US-200-4625 (CAPELLA) is an ongoing phase 2/3 clinical study evaluating LEN in combination with an OBR in ARV treatment-experienced PWH with MDR.""
Rationale: The paper mentions that the study involved ARV treatment-experienced individuals.
Answer: Yes

### QID 15
Question: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?
Evidence: ""The drugs most often used in the OBR were tenofovir (79%, either as TAF [53%] or as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [26%]), FTC (68%), DRV (61%), DTG (50%), doravirine (26%), and IBA (24%).""
Rationale: The paper lists the drugs most often used in the optimized background regimen (OBR) for the study participants.
Answer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI, INSTI, CAI

### QID 16
