Question: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?
Evidence: ""The creation of pET-15b expression plasmids coding for soluble wild-type (WT) and H51Y-mutated HIV subtype B IN (INB) was described previously (14). The R262K substitution was introduced to create the pET-15b INB(R262K) and pET-15b INB(H51Y/R262K) plasmids by using a Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (New England BioLabs), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

### QID 2
Question: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?
Evidence: ""The combination of H51Y and R262K substitutions slightly decreased susceptibility to DTG (fold change = 1.87) in cell-based resistance assays. HIV susceptibility to DTG and RAL was determined using short-term resistance assays with TZM-bl cells, as described previously (8). The addition of R262K to H51Y decreases HIV-1 susceptibility to DTG. To further characterize the R262K secondary substitution in the presence of H51Y, we performed resistance assays using TZM-bl cells and various concentrations of DTG or RAL ( Fig. 4 ), which generated EC 50 s for each virus as well as fold change (FC) values ( Table 2 ). Although the primary H51Y substitution did not confer resistance against DTG or RAL (FC values of 1.25 and 0.98, respectively), consistent with previous results ( 11 ), the addition of R262K did result in low-level but significant biochemical resistance to DTG but not to RAL (FC values of 1.9 and 0.92, respectively).""

### Evidence: 
The combination of H51Y and R262K substitutions slightly decreased susceptibility to DTG (fold change = 1.87) in cell-based resistance assays. HIV susceptibility to DTG and RAL was determined using short-term resistance assays with TZM-bl cells, as described previously (8).

### Evidence: 
Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is an investigational prodrug of the HIV-1 nucleotide reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NtRTI) tenofovir (TFV), with improved potency and drug delivery properties over the current prodrug, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). TAF is currently in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Phase 1 and 2 studies have shown that TAF was associated with increased peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) drug loading and increased suppression of HIV-1 replication compared to treatment with TDF. In this study, selection of in vitro resistance to both TAF and the parent compound, TFV, led to the emergence of HIV-1 with the K65R amino acid substitution in RT with 6.5-fold-reduced susceptibility to TAF.

Evidence: ""HIV-2 group A, HIV-2 group B, and HIV-1 isolates from INSTI-naïve individuals were comparably sensitive to dolutegravir in the single-cycle assay (mean EC50 values = 1.9, 2.6, and 1.3 nM, respectively). Integrase substitutions E92Q, Y143C, E92Q + Y143C, and Q148R conferred relatively low levels of resistance to dolutegravir in HIV-2ROD9 (2- to 6-fold), but Q148K, E92Q + N155H, T97A + N155H and G140S + Q148R resulted in moderate resistance (10- to 46-fold), and the combination of T97A + Y143C in HIV-2ROD9 conferred high-level resistance (>5000-fold). In contrast, HIV-1NL4-3 mutants E92Q + N155H, G140S + Q148R, and T97A + Y143C showed 2-fold, 4-fold, and no increase in EC50, respectively, relative to the parental strain.""

29373677,"### Q1: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?

Question: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?

Evidence: ""The patient infected with a B subtype HIV-1 strain received an antiretroviral treatment including INSTIs from 2008 to 2015, a period during which CD4 counts had increased from 350 to 940 cells/mm^3^. The patient was first treated with raltegravir in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada) for 6 years until 2014, during which time the viral load remained undetectable (plasma HIV RNA <20 copies/mL). Every 6 months, during follow-up, genotypic analysis of integrase was tested in DNA and never showed any mutations selected against raltegravir. Owing to treatment intolerance, a simplification of treatment with dolutegravir monotherapy (not currently recommended in any guidelines for HIV-1 treatment) was proposed to the patient in 2014 while the viral load was still undetectable.""

Answer: Yes

### Q2: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?

Question: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?

Evidence: ""We first investigated the replicative properties of mutant viruses. The p24^gag^ production of these mutants was similar to the WT showing that none of these mutations impaired the late steps of viral replication (Figure 1 a, left panel and black columns). The early steps of HIV-1 replication were investigated by HeLa-P4 cell infection (Figure 1 a, left panel and grey columns). Interestingly, infectivity of the mutants was similar to the WT indicating that mutations identified in the patient do not impair the early steps of viral replication. The above-mentioned mutations could affect the 3′-processing and/or the strand-transfer reaction mediated by IN. Our cell-free reaction results demonstrate that the 3′-processing efficiency for all mutants was similar but significantly lower compared with the WT (an average of 50% of the WT, Figure 1 a middle panel and black columns). However, the strand-transfer efficiency was not affected by any mutations (Figure 1 a, middle panel and grey columns).""

Rationale: The paper describes the process of antiviral testing against dolutegravir and raltegravir using recombinant viruses.

### QID 2
Question: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?
Evidence: ""The combination of H51Y and R262K substitutions slightly decreased susceptibility to DTG (fold change = 1.87) in cell-based resistance assays. HIV susceptibility to DTG and RAL was determined using short-term resistance assays with TZM-bl cells, as described previously (8). The addition of R262K to H51Y decreases HIV-1 susceptibility to DTG. To further characterize the R262K secondary substitution in the presence of H51Y, we performed resistance assays using TZM-bl cells and various concentrations of DTG or RAL ( Fig. 4 ), which generated EC 50 s for each virus as well as fold change (FC) values ( Table 2 ). Although the primary H51Y substitution did not confer resistance against DTG or RAL (FC values of 1.25 and 0.98, respectively), consistent with previous results ( 11 ), the addition of R262K did result in low-level but significant biochemical resistance to DTG but not to RAL (FC values of 1.9 and 0.92, respectively).""

Question: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?

Evidence: ""she initiated dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (DTG/ABC/3TC) 39 months after diagnosis (M39); however, because of intermittent adherence, she did not experience virological suppression and was subsequently switched to BIC/TAF/FTC because of the smaller pill size while admitted to hospital with esophagitis and a CD4 count of 62 cells/μL (6%) at M59. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was added for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis. Repeat genotyping at M61 showed wild-type virus. She continued to be prescribed BIC/TAF/FTC with ongoing viraemia due to poor adherence. At M79, her CD4 count was 166 cells/μL (11%), viral load was 4288 copies/mL, and genotypic resistance testing captured new reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations: T69D/N, K70E, and T215I, but she could not be contacted to switch her regimen. She discontinued BIC/TAF/FTC on her own at M82 upon learning she was pregnant. She restarted treatment with DTG + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/FTC at M84, before being intensified to darunavir (DRV) + ritonavir (RTV) + DTG + TDF/FTC when diagnosed with cerebral toxoplasmosis at M85. After delivery, she started DTG + rilpivirine (RPV)/TAF/FTC to reduce pill burden but did not achieve virological suppression and died of hypoxemic respiratory failure at M86. She experienced an HIV RNA <40 copies/mL on initial therapy with lopinavir/RTV + zidovudine/lamivudine (AZT/3TC). She then switched to atazanavir (ATV) + RTV + TDF/FTC for simplification at M25 but reported intermittent adherence and experienced episodes of breakthrough viraemia before stopping HIV therapy at M58. Genotyping at M65 revealed the V82I protease mutation along with several genetic polymorphisms in the protease gene (Table 1). To reduce pill burden, she was switched to single-tablet efavirenz (EFV)/TDF/FTC at M66. Following several treatment interruptions, she switched to elvitegravir/cobicistat/TDF/FTC (EVG/c/TDF/FTC) at M83 and was then lost to follow-up at M96. She restarted antiretroviral therapy (ART) with EVG/c/TAF/FTC at M141 but switched to BIC/TAF/FTC due to fatigue and dizziness at M148; viral load was 128 890 copies/mL and genotype showed wild-type virus. Her other medications were TMP-SMX and a multivitamin, dosed separately from her ART. Following virological success (HIV RNA <40 copies/mL) on BIC/TAF/FTC, she experienced breakthrough viraemia (HIV RNA 18 870 copies/mL) at M161 due to poor adherence. Genotyping showed an emergent M184I mutation. She subsequently switched to BIC/TAF/FTC plus DRV/c but has yet to achieve virological success. He initiated DRV/RTV/TDF/FTC at M5, when viral load was 2 437 253 copies/mL. He simplified the regimen to DRV/RTV alone at M9 before resuming DRV/RTV/TDF/FTC at M20 due to persistent low-level viraemia of 54–60 copies/mL between M16 and M18; viral load was <40 copies/mL at M22. At M80, viral load remained undetectable at <40 copies/mL, and at M83 he switched to BIC/TAF/FTC for simplification.""
