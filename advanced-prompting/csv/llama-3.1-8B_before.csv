27009474,"**Question: Q148N, a Novel Integrase Inhibitor Resistance Mutation Associated with Low-Level Reduction in Elvitegravir Susceptibility**

**Evidence:** The paper states that a 50-year-old hispanic homosexual man underwent HIV-1 seroconversion in August 2014. His CD4 count at the time of diagnosis was 405 cells/mm3 and his plasma HIV-1 RNA level was 3,980 copies/ml. A baseline genotypic resistance test revealed the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistance mutations L210W and T215D that were interpreted as causing intermediate resistance to zidovudine and low-level resistance to tenofovir; the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-resistance mutations K101P and K103S that were interpreted as causing high-level resistance to each of the NNRTIs; and the protease inhibitor-resistance mutations D30N, L33F, I54V, N88D, and L90M that were interpreted as causing intermediate or high-level resistance to each of the PIs except darunavir. The patient was started on the once daily integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-containing fixed-dose combination tenofovir/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat.

**Rationale:** The paper describes a patient who underwent HIV-1 seroconversion in August 2014 and was diagnosed with a high viral load and low CD4 count. The patient was started on a treatment regimen containing tenofovir/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat. The paper also mentions that the patient's baseline genotypic resistance test revealed resistance to multiple classes of antiretroviral drugs.

**Answer:** Yes

**Question: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?**

**Evidence:** The paper states that a baseline genotypic resistance test revealed the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistance mutations L210W and T215D that were interpreted as causing intermediate resistance to zidovudine and low-level resistance to tenofovir; the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-resistance mutations K101P and K103S that were interpreted as causing high-level resistance to each of the NNRTIs; and the protease inhibitor-resistance mutations D30N, L33F, I54V, N88D, and L90M that were interpreted as causing intermediate or high-level resistance to each of the PIs except darunavir. The paper also mentions that the sequence of the clinical clone has been submitted to the GenBank under the accession number KU761565.

**Question 1: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?**

Question: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?

Evidence: Plasma samples were collected from 76 HIV-infected children/adolescents under clinical monitoring at the Hospital del Niño Doctor José Renán Esquivel in Panama, five of them drug-naive and 71 ART-experienced at sampling, exhibiting >50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL of plasma. HIV-1 RNA was extracted from plasma by automated magnetic silica extraction using the EasyMAG extractor (bioMérieux). The extracted RNA was amplified by RT--PCR and nested PCR to obtain the HIV-1 *pol* region, using primers designed by WHO for protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) amplification and ANRS primers for integrase (IN) amplification, ^25\,\ 26^ as previously described. ^27\,\ 28^ PCR amplicons were purified with illustra ^TM^ ExoProStar ^TM^ (Cytiva) and sequenced by Macrogen Inc.

Rationale: The paper mentions that plasma samples were collected from 76 HIV-infected children/adolescents, and that HIV-1 RNA was extracted from plasma and amplified by RT--PCR and nested PCR to obtain the HIV-1 *pol* region.

**Question 1: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?**

Question: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?

Evidence: We carried out a laboratory-based cross-sectional and analytical study from November 2011 to August 2019 with adults (≥15 years) who had failed first- and second-line ART, received for genotypic resistance testing (GRT) at the Chantal Biya International Reference Centre (CIRCB) for Research on HIV and AIDS Prevention and Management, Yaoundé, Cameroon. Viral RNA was extracted using a commercially available protocol after an initial two-hour centrifugation of 1 mL of plasma at 14,000 rpm to improve viral RNA concentration and thus increase PCR sensitivity. Following this step, 140 µL of plasma was retained for HIV-1 RNA extraction following the QIAGEN protocol (QIAamp ^®^ DNA Minikit; QIAGEN, Courtaboeuf, France). Using an in-house protocol and two-step polymerase chain reaction-PCR (RT-PCR and Nested-PCR), HIV-1 pol-gene (protease and reverse-transcriptase regions) was then amplified (∼1600 base pairs). Using agarose gel electrophoresis, the effectiveness and integrity of PCR products was confirmed, following which the amplicons were purified. Purified products were submitted to a sequencing reaction. Products of the sequencing reaction were then gel-purified using SEPHADEX (Seperation Pharmacia Dextran; Cytiva Sweden AB, SE-751 84 Uppsala, Sweden) gel to remove excess reactants and render DNA products pure. Sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems 3500 genetic analyzer (HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan) and sequence assembly and editing with SeqScape v2.7 (Applied Biosystems) or Recall v2.28 [19]. The Stanford University database (Stanford HIVdb) was used to identify drug resistance mutations (DRMs).

Question: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?

Evidence: The paper states that genetic sequencing were performed on clinical samples from patients, participants, subjects, blood donors, newly diagnosed persons, newly infected persons, PWH, PLWH or patient cohorts. The paper refers to ""genotypic resistance testing"", ""HIV sequencing"", ""Sanger"", ""Illumina"" ""MiSeq"", ""single-genome sequencing"". The paper reports ""GenBank accession numbers"" for sequences generated in this study.

Rationale: The paper mentions that genetic sequencing were performed on clinical samples from patients, which indicates that HIV sequences were obtained from patient samples. Additionally, the paper refers to various sequencing methods and reports GenBank accession numbers, which further supports the conclusion that HIV sequences were obtained from patient samples.

Answer: Yes

**Question 2: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?**

Question: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?

Evidence: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility data. It only reports on genotypic resistance testing and sequencing of HIV sequences from patient samples.

Rationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility data, such as phenotypic susceptibility, phenotypic resistance testing, or drug susceptibility assays. Therefore, it is unlikely that the paper reports in vitro drug susceptibility data.

Answer: No

**Question 3: Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?**

Question: Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?

Evidence: The paper reports that sequences were submitted to GenBank and provides GenBank accession numbers for the sequences.

Rationale: The paper explicitly states that sequences were submitted to GenBank and provides accession numbers, which indicates that the sequences are publicly available.

Answer: Yes

**Question 4: What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?**

Question: What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?

Evidence: The paper provides GenBank accession numbers for the sequences, which are: MT667444, MT667445, MT667446, MT667447, MT667448, MT667449, MT667450, MT667451, MT667452, MT667453, MT667454,
