- If the paper mentions ABI instruments (ABI PRISM/Applied Biosystems 310/3100/3130/3130xl/3500/3500xl/3730/3730xl/3100-Avant) or Beckman CEQ 2000 XL, then consider Sanger sequencing.
- If it mentions BigDye/ABI PRISM Dye Terminator (v1.0/v3.0/v3.1), dye-terminator, dye–deoxy chain terminator, or dideoxy sequencing, then consider Sanger sequencing.
- If it says capillary sequencer/capillary electrophoresis with ABI analyzers, electropherograms, or primer walking, then consider Sanger sequencing.
- If it states “direct PCR sequencing,” “bidirectional sequencing,” “population-based sequencing,” “bulk sequencing/consensus from bulk,” or “automated population-based DNA sequence analysis” without NGS context, then consider Sanger sequencing.
- If it uses clinical genotyping kits TruGene/OpenGene/ViroSeq/GeneSeq Integrase/vircoTYPE/ANRS consensus technique on ABI platforms, then consider Sanger sequencing.
- If it references Sequencher/SeqScape as analysis tools alongside ABI capillary data, then consider Sanger sequencing.

- If it mentions Illumina platforms (MiSeq/HiSeq/iSeq), paired-end (e.g., 2×150/2×250/2×300), library prep (Nextera, NEBNext), target capture, or “Illumina platform,” then consider Illumina sequencing.
- If it says “next-generation sequencing (NGS),” “ultra-deep sequencing (UDS),” or “deep sequencing” without a platform, then consider NGS.
- If it specifies 454/pyrosequencing (GS Junior/GS Titanium), GenoSure Gag-Pro “uses NGS,” Sentosa SQ/Vela NGS, or Oxford Nanopore (GridION), then consider NGS.
- If it specifies PacBio RSII/SMRT, then consider PacBio sequencing.

- If both Sanger terms (above) and NGS terms (above) are present in the same study, then consider combined answer “Sanger sequencing; NGS” (or “Sanger sequencing; Illumina sequencing” if Illumina is explicit).

- If it only says “in-house assay/method,” “as previously described,” “genotyping”/“resistance testing”/“population genotyping”/“phylogenetic analysis” without platform/chemistry, or focuses on selection/mutagenesis without reporting sequencing tech, then consider Not reported.
- If sequences were sourced from databases (GenBank/LANL/ANRS) without method detail, then consider Not reported.

- Validate all identified phrases against the Methods or cited references in the paper before finalizing the answer.
