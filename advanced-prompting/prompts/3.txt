Instruction: Decide if the paper made its sequences publicly available.

Positive cues (answer Yes):
- If the paper says “submitted/deposited to GenBank/NCBI/EMBL/DDBJ/ENA/SRA” with accession numbers (e.g., “GenBank accession numbers KF…–KF…”, “FN…”, “HM…”, “OP…”, “OQ…”, etc.), then consider Yes.
- If it states “available under accession numbers” or “have been deposited/are available in GenBank” (even across multiple ranges/genes/cohorts), then consider Yes.
- If accession numbers are provided in a Supplementary Table or Data Availability statement (e.g., “accession numbers are in Table Sx”), then consider Yes.
- If only a subset was uploaded (privacy constraints) but accession numbers are listed, then consider Yes.
- If raw reads are in SRA and/or consensus/amplicon sequences are in GenBank with accession numbers, then consider Yes.
- If sequences are deposited in recognized nucleotide repositories beyond GenBank (EMBL/ENA/DDBJ) with accessions, then consider Yes.
- If sequences analyzed/generated “in this study” are accompanied by accessions, then consider Yes (even if some accessions refer to specific clones, regions, or timepoints).

Negative cues (answer No):
- If no accession numbers are reported and no explicit deposition statement to public repositories is made, then consider No.
- If the paper only cites accession numbers from previous studies or reference strains (not sequences analyzed/generated here), then consider No.
- If it is a review/meta-analysis using existing GenBank data without depositing new data, then consider No.
- If it states “data available upon request,” “will not be publicly released,” or privacy precludes release (without listing any accessions), then consider No.
- If only Protein Data Bank (PDB) coordinates are deposited (no nucleotide sequences), then consider No.
- If sequences are only available on an institutional website or unspecified URL without accessioned deposition in public nucleotide databases, then consider No.
- If it says “submitted to GenBank; accession numbers pending” without confirming availability, then lean No.

Always verify the exact phrasing and whether the accession numbers correspond to sequences generated/analyzed by the paper.
