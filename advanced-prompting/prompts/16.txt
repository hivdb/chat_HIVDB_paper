Instruction: Extract exactly which drugs participants had received before the sequenced sample was taken.

Core identification
- If the paper states “treatment-naïve,” “ART-naïve,” “drug-naïve,” “before ART initiation,” “baseline pre-treatment,” “newly diagnosed,” or “diagnosed at enrollment with no prior ART,” then consider no drugs received before sequencing.
- If sampling is “at the time of virological failure,” “while receiving,” “on [regimen] at sampling,” “during [drug] treatment,” or “co-prescribed [drug]s,” then consider those named drugs as received before sequencing.
- If the text reports ARV drugs detected in specimens (e.g., efavirenz, nevirapine, lamivudine detected), then consider those detected drugs as received.
- If only classes are given (e.g., “two NRTIs + one NNRTI/PI”) without drug names, then consider not reported unless specific drugs are listed elsewhere.

Trial and timing nuances
- If randomized regimens are described but sequencing was at baseline before starting therapy, then consider no drugs received.
- If sequencing occurred after regimen start (e.g., failure on first-line or salvage regimen), then consider all drugs in that regimen as received.
- If “PMTCT,” “single-dose nevirapine,” or neonatal zidovudine prophylaxis are mentioned before sampling, then consider nevirapine and/or zidovudine received.
- If integrase genotyping notes “INI-naïve” but lists concurrent NRTI/PI therapy, include only explicitly named NRTIs/PIs.

In vitro/non-clinical or database studies
- If sequences are from lab clones, site-directed mutants, in vitro selections, or purely database/review compilations without patient treatment context, then consider not reported.

Drug/name mapping cues
- Map synonyms/abbreviations: AZT/ZDV (zidovudine), 3TC (lamivudine), FTC (emtricitabine), ABC (abacavir), D4T (stavudine), ddI (didanosine), TDF/TFV (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/tenofovir), TAF (tenofovir alafenamide); EFV (efavirenz), NVP (nevirapine), ETR (etravirine), RPV (rilpivirine), DOR (doravirine); LPV/r (lopinavir/ritonavir), ATV/r (atazanavir/ritonavir), DRV(/r) (darunavir), NFV (nelfinavir), SQV (saquinavir), IDV (indinavir), FPV (fosamprenavir), TPV (tipranavir), RTV (ritonavir); RAL (raltegravir), EVG (elvitegravir), DTG (dolutegravir), BIC (bictegravir), CAB (cabotegravir), LEN (lenacapavir); MVC (maraviroc), IBA (ibalizumab).
- If “PI/r” appears, include both the PI and ritonavir.

Contextual specifics
- If pediatric regimens list d4T/3TC/NVP or LPV/r, then consider those drugs received.
- If switch/optimized background therapy lists drugs (e.g., DRV/r, MVC, TDF/FTC), include them.
- If long-acting CAB/RPV used at sampling, consider CAB and RPV received.

Always confirm timing and drug names against the paper’s sampling description before finalizing.
