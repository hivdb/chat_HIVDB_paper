Use these if-then heuristics to decide if HIV sequences are from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs (answer options: Yes, No, Not reported).

Treatment-experienced (answer Yes):
- If phrases like “on ART/cART/HAART,” “ART-experienced,” “treatment-experienced,” “heavily pretreated,” “salvage regimen,” or “prior ARV exposure/regimens” appear, then consider Yes.
- If “virologic failure/failing therapy while receiving [drug/regimen],” “second-line/third-line/switch,” “ritonavir-boosted PI as second-line,” “salvage,” or “expanded access/Named Patient Program,” then consider Yes.
- If “on [specific ARV]: NNRTI/PI/NRTI/INSTI (e.g., raltegravir, elvitegravir, dolutegravir, cabotegravir/rilpivirine),” “virally suppressed on long-term ART,” or “ATI after ART,” then consider Yes.
- If “genotyped at failure,” “samples collected during/after therapy,” “at cART initiation and failure,” or “plasma collected at time of failure/suppression,” then consider Yes.
- If infants/PMTCT exposure noted (sdNVP, ZDV), maternal ART/prophylaxis, or infants on ART at diagnosis, then consider Yes.
- If PrEP or topical/systemic ARVs used in prevention trials with sequencing of seroconverters/participants, then consider Yes.
- If cohort mixes naive and experienced, and experienced sequences are included, then overall Yes.
- If “INI-naive but ART-experienced” (e.g., NRTI+PI while INI-naive), then consider Yes.

Treatment-naive (answer No):
- If “ART-naive,” “treatment-naive,” “drug-naive,” “no previous ARV exposure,” “newly diagnosed/primary/acute/recent infection,” “baseline/pre-treatment,” or “before ART initiation/eligibility to start ART” at time of sampling, then consider No.
- If sequences from blood donors or surveillance of transmitted drug resistance in naive populations, then consider No.
- If elite/persistent controllers explicitly “without ART,” then consider No.
- Do not infer exposure from presence of resistance mutations alone without treatment history.

Not reported (insufficient to decide):
- If work is in vitro (site-directed mutants, lab clones, resistance selection, enzyme/biochemical assays) or recombinant constructs, then consider Not reported.
- If sequences are compiled from databases/literature without treatment metadata, or the paper lacks treatment history, then consider Not reported.

Always confirm that actual patient-derived sequences were generated/analyzed and match the treatment status described in the paper.
