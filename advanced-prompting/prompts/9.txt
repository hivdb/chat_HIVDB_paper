Use these if-then cues to identify which HIV genes were sequenced:

General “pol” mapping
- If “pol genotyping/sequencing” is stated without subregions, then consider Pol.
- If “pol region encompassing protease and reverse transcriptase,” “PR/RT,” “protease (codons 1–99) and RT (codons …),” “PRRT,” or “pro-RT,” then consider PR and RT.
- If “integrase coding region of pol,” “IN,” “p31,” “GeneSeq/ViroSeq Integrase,” or HXB2 ≈ 4053–5214/4160–5220, then consider IN.

Reverse transcriptase-specific
- If “reverse transcriptase (RT),” “p51/p66,” “connection subdomain,” or “RNase H domain (p15),” then consider RT.

Protease-specific
- If “protease (PR)” with codons ~1–99 or PR amplicon, then consider PR.

Integrase-specific
- If “INSTI resistance,” “dolutegravir/raltegravir/elvitegravir/cabotegravir genotyping,” or “integrase sequencing,” then consider IN.

Envelope-specific
- If “env,” “gp120,” “gp41,” “gp160,” “V3 loop/C2V3,” or “coreceptor usage geno2pheno,” then consider Env.

Gag and related
- If “gag,” “p17,” “p24,” “capsid/CA,” “p6,” then consider Gag; if “Gag-protease”/“Gag-PR,” then consider Gag and PR; if “p6-RT”/“p6PrRT,” then consider Gag plus PR and/or RT as described.

Other/accessory
- If “vif,” “vpr,” “vpu,” “nef,” “tat,” or “rev” are stated as amplified/sequenced, then consider those specific genes.
- If “LTR,” “U3,” or “TATA box” region sequenced, then consider LTR.

Genome scale
- If “full-length genome,” “whole genome,” “complete genome,” or “WGS,” then consider Full length genome.
- If “near full-length genome,” “NFLG,” or “5′/3′ half-genome,” then consider Near full length genome.

Coordinate cues (HXB2)
- ≈2253–3369 or 2071–3870 implies PR/RT; ≈6417–8497 or V3 implies Env; ≈1248–1707 or p17–p24 implies Gag/CA; ≈790–3421 gag–RT implies Gag and RT; ≈790–2549 Gag–PR implies Gag and PR; ≈1486–5058 implies extensive Pol.

Assay/brand cues
- If “ViroSeq/TruGene (PR/RT)” or “ANRS consensus PR/RT,” then consider PR and RT.
- If “GeneSeq/PhenoSense Integrase,” then consider IN.

Non-sequencing
- If only cloning/site-directed mutagenesis without patient/sample sequencing, or it’s a review/meta-analysis with no new sequencing, then consider Not reported.

Always confirm that the paper explicitly says amplified/sequenced/genotyped for the region before assigning genes.
