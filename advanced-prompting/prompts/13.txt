Use these if-then rules to decide if patients were in a clinical trial:

Explicit clinical trial indicators (answer Yes):
- If the paper states “randomized,” “double-blind,” “placebo-controlled,” “open-label,” “controlled,” or “multicenter” with intervention arms, then consider Yes.
- If it mentions “phase I/II/III/IIIb/2/3 trial” or “analytical treatment interruption (ATI) within a trial,” then consider Yes.
- If the study is “registered at ClinicalTrials.gov” (e.g., NCT number), then consider Yes.
- If participants were “enrolled in” or “participants in” named trials (e.g., ACTG, HPTN 074/075/083, SPARTAC, DART/NORA, CAPRISA 004, DRIVE-FORWARD/DRIVE-AHEAD, GEMINI-1/2, DAWNING, CAPELLA, IMPAACT 2014, P1093, CHAPAS4, SEARCH, RV411, RESIST-2, FLAIR), then consider Yes.
- If described as a “substudy” of a clinical trial or “prerandomization screening phase,” then consider Yes.
- If a “registry” explicitly has an NCT identifier indicating a trial (e.g., PRESTIGIO Registry with NCT), then consider Yes.

Observational/non-trial indicators (answer No):
- If described as “observational,” “cohort” (prospective/retrospective), “cross-sectional,” “case-control,” “surveillance,” “epidemiological,” “national survey,” “sentinel surveillance,” or “routine clinical practice/testing/care,” then consider No.
- If samples were from “outpatient/clinic/hospital cohorts,” “expanded access program (EAP)/compassionate use,” “registry/biobank,” or “screened by physicians,” then consider No.
- If “patients in clinical trials were excluded,” then consider No.
- Named cohorts without trial designation (e.g., ANRS CO5, ATHENA, InfCare HIV, HOMER, Sinikithemba, AIEDRP, RV217, UWPIC, FRESH, TARA) imply No.
- Case reports/series imply No.

No patient data or unclear source (answer Not reported):
- If purely in vitro/animal/lab work (e.g., “site-directed mutagenesis,” “recombinant clones,” “enzyme/tissue culture resistance selection,” “no clinical specimens”), then consider Not reported.
- If sequences/samples come from databases or reagent programs with mixed or unspecified sources (e.g., HIVDB, GenBank, Los Alamos, NIAID Reagent Program) and trial involvement isn’t specified for your subset, then consider Not reported.
- If the paper provides no statement about trial participation, then consider Not reported.

Always confirm the final classification by cross-checking exact wording in the paper.
