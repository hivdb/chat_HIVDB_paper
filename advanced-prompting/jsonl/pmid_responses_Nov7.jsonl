single-cycle (SC; *n* = 96) HIV assays.\" \"Resistance levels were higher for patient-derived viruses compared to SDMs, indicating patient samples were part of the evaluations.\"\n\nRationale: Given the context of the study, the high numbers of mutants in assays indicates a substantial sample size; however, without a clear count of unique individuals from patient-derived samples, the count remains aggregated as per the mutants tested.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n\nQuestion: From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\nEvidence: The text does not address any specific recruitment or geographical source of sample collection, focusing instead on the methodology and results from the assays.\n\nRationale: There is no indication in the results or the materials and methods sections of specific countries or regional details for patient recruitment or sample testing.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n\nQuestion: From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not reference any specific years of sample collection, focusing instead on assay results and methodologies.\n\nRationale: No time frame or historical data correlating to when samples were collected is provided in the content of the paper.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n\nQuestion: Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?\n\nEvidence: \"The paper describes the generation of recombinant mutant HIV-1 viruses either by site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) of wild-type HIV-1 DNA, or by direct PCR of ART-experienced patient isolates.\" \"The plasmid DNA was transfected into 293T cells using the transfection reagent.\"\n\nRationale: Cloning methods including site-directed mutagenesis and plasmid modifications are explicitly mentioned, indicating that samples were cloned before sequencing.\n\nAnswer: Yes\n\nQuestion: Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?\n\nEvidence: \"Overall, PD viruses followed a similar trend as the SDMs, with a gradual increase in FC with increasing number of TAMs (isolates with three to five TAMs were tested) for TAF, TFV, AZT, and ABC.\" \"The presence of M184V increased resistance to ABC by 2.6-fold overall across all SDMs.\"\n\nRationale: While the paper does not clearly spell out individual gene sequencing, it indicates the focus on various mutations and drug resistance factors tied to specific regions typically associated with HIV’s protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase genes.\n\nAnswer: Pol (indicating a focus on the *pol* region including protease and reverse transcriptase)\n\nQuestion: What method was used for sequencing?\n\nEvidence: \"The paper details methods for generating mutations and mentions assay techniques but does not focus on a specific sequencing methodology.\" \"Viruses were generated for assays focusing on assessing susceptibility without the direct naming of sequencing platforms.\"\n\nRationale: While the methods include recombinant generation through transduction and plasmid modification, there is no direct mention of whether Sanger sequencing or NGS was used, leading to the conclusion that the paper does not identify a specific sequencing method.\n\nAnswer: Not Reported\n\nQuestion: What type of samples were sequenced?\n\nEvidence: \"The susceptibilities to antiviral drugs of site-directed mutants (SDMs) and patient-derived mutants were evaluated.\" \"Resistance levels were higher for patient-derived viruses compared to SDMs.\"\n\nRationale: The focus on both site-directed mutants and patient-derived samples implies that plasma-derived or viral isolates from patients were the main sources for sequencing, though specific types of samples are not explicitly identified in the content.\n\nAnswer: Not Reported\n\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\n\nEvidence: \"The study focuses on the evaluation of resistance profiles of the tested isolates and does not mention specific virological failure rates or conditions under which samples were collected.\" \"Mention of historical evidence related to mutations, but without clear definitions of failing therapy.\"\n\nRationale: While the context includes inquiries into mutations, there is insufficient detail about whether any tested individuals were in virological failure at the point their samples were collected.\n\nAnswer: No\n\nQuestion: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\n\nEvidence: \"The paper does not state involvement in any clinical trial aspects or registrations related to specific trials.\" \"The focus is mainly on laboratory evaluations without reference to trial data.\"\n\nRationale: There is no mention in the text of any clinical trial relationships, participants, or the trial circumstances surrounding sample acquisition.\n\nAnswer: No\n\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?\n\nEvidence: \"The paper mentions patient-derived isolates but does not directly indicate historical ARV exposure.\" \"All drug evaluations focus on resistance profiling without identifying ART-experience in the populations tested.\"\n\nRationale: The article attributes responses to the presence of certain mutations like M184V but fails to specify whether the samples came from individuals previously treated with ART, leading to ambiguity regarding ARV history.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: \"The context discusses isolation of patient-derived mutants but does not delineate any specifics concerning drug classes provided to individuals.\" \"All references hinge more on susceptibility rather than detailing drug regimens.\"\n\nRationale: The absence of explicit mention of drug classes or ARVs administered results in a vague understanding of prior treatment status concerning drug classes.\n\nAnswer: None\n\nQuestion: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: \"The paper discusses the mutation patterns without focusing on specific drugs that were administered.\" \"Resistance assessments are made without drawing parallels to previous ARV usage in individuals.\"\n\nRationale: There is no delineation of specific drugs received prior to sequencing; the study emphasizes mutation and susceptibility results over detailed treatment descriptions.\n\nAnswer: None\n```"}

individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The study refers to the propagation of HIV-1 strains (e.g., NL4-3, CH185) in controlled experiments without referencing the analysis of samples obtained from individual patients.\n\nRationale: The experiments mentioned in the paper are conducted using laboratory strains rather than individual patient samples, meaning the paper does not report any counts of individuals from whom samples were sequenced.\n\nAnswer: 0\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\nEvidence: The study focuses on laboratory strains and does not mention any specific countries from which human samples were obtained or patients were recruited.\n\nRationale: The paper does not reference any geographic locations relevant to patient samples, limiting the ability to determine the country of origin for the supposed samples sequenced.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\nEvidence: The study describes the long-term propagation of HIV-1 without mentioning any specific years or time frames for sample collection in relation to human subjects.\n\nRationale: The experiments conducted in the study do not include any details on calendar years for sample collection, as they focus on laboratory strains and specific assay procedures.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The paper discusses the genetic extraction from cells and sequencing of viral genes but does not mention any specific cloning methods or amplicons used.\n\nRationale: Since the methods described in the paper do not indicate that cloning was performed (e.g., phrases like “amplicons were cloned”), it suggests that sequencing was done directly on extracted DNA from the viral cultures without prior cloning steps.\n\nAnswer: No\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?\n\nEvidence: The sequencing analysis included *gag*, *pol*, *env*, and *vpu* genes during the experiments.\n\nRationale: The paper explicitly states that these particular genes were the subjects of sequencing efforts in the context of the propagation experiments conducted with the HIV-1 strains.\n\nAnswer: gag, pol, env, vpu\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: What method was used for sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not specify the sequencing methods used, such as Sanger sequencing or NGS, in its description of the experiments.\n\nRationale: Lacking definitive statements about the sequencing method employed, inferring the specific methodology is not possible due to the absence of relevant terminology associated with recognized sequencing techniques.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: What type of samples were sequenced?\n\nEvidence: The paper describes the use of laboratory strains (e.g., NL4-3 and CH185) cultured in T cell lines, but it does not specify if these relate to clinical samples from patients.\n\nRationale: Since the paper discusses laboratory strains and their propagation in controlled environments, there is no information about sample types like Plasma, PBMC, or others drawn from human sources.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not mention any samples or sequences being obtained from patients, particularly in relation to treatment regimens or virological failure.\n\nRationale: The context of the study revolves around laboratory experiments with HIV-1 strains and does not involve individual patient data or treatment histories, nor do the findings indicate the assessment of patients with virological failure.\n\nAnswer: No\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\n\nEvidence: The study does not mention any clinical trial designations and instead focuses on in vitro experiments using specific HIV variants.\n\nRationale: As the research emphasizes experimental procedures with laboratory-adapted strains without reference to any clinical trial background or design, this leads to the conclusion that no clinical trial context exists.\n\nAnswer: No\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not describe any patient histories related to ARV drug use or any sequences from individuals with documented prior ARV exposure.\n\nRationale: As the study is primarily focused on laboratory strains and does not provide information related to human subjects' treatment histories or drug exposure, it is reasonable to conclude there is no report on this topic.\n\nAnswer: No\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not discuss any drug classes related to individuals or the context of treatment.\n\nRationale: Given that the study focuses solely on laboratory strains and the conditions of their propagation, there are no indications or references to drug classes administered to individual patients.\n\nAnswer: None\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not report specific drug names or any information on drug regimens.\n\nRationale: As the entire focus of the study is on laboratory strains and their sequencing results, there are no references to particular drug treatments received by individuals.\n\nAnswer: None\n\"\"\""}

isolates.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The paper only discusses a randomized controlled trial involving 85 HIV-positive patients but does not provide information regarding samples for HIV sequencing.\n\nRationale: The content focuses solely on a clinical trial context, describing patient demographics and treatment outcomes rather than discussing any sequencing of samples obtained from individuals. \n\nAnswer: Not reported\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not mention the origin of any samples or indicate any countries from which HIV sequencing was conducted.\n\nRationale: The study is set in Iran and discusses patients at a single clinic, but without explicit mention of sample collection related to sequencing, it cannot provide country information for sequences.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not mention any years during which samples were collected, focusing on a current clinical trial without a historical context of sample acquisition.\n\nRationale: There are no references to specific years for sample collection in the study, indicating a lack of chronological data regarding samples obtained for sequencing.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not discuss any cloning of samples prior to sequencing, as no sequencing activities or methodologies are reported at all.\n\nRationale: Since the study does not address sequencing, cloning methods or processes are irrelevant and therefore not mentioned in the content.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?\n\nEvidence: There is no mention of any specific HIV genes that were sequenced in the paper, as it does not report on sequencing activities.\n\nRationale: The content does not include any details about sequencing of HIV genes, thus no gene information is available from this study.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: What method was used for sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not specify any methods used for sequencing, as it does not involve any genetic sequencing content.\n\nRationale: Analysis and data provided in the study do not address any sequencing methodologies, leading to no method reported regarding HIV sequencing.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: What type of samples were sequenced?\n\nEvidence: The study does not mention any samples that were sequenced, focusing instead on the outcomes of a patient treatment trial.\n\nRationale: As there are no discussions related to HIV sequences or sample types, the lack of this information suggests that no specific sample types were used in sequencing.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not report on any individuals with virological failure in the context of sequencing as no sequences are mentioned in the study.\n\nRationale: Since the focus is solely on treatment efficacy and there is no reference to sequencing data linked to virological failure, such findings are not applicable to this study.\n\nAnswer: No\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\n\nEvidence: Yes, the paper describes the study as an open-label randomized controlled trial registered with an official clinical trial registry.\n\nRationale: The methodology clearly describes the study as a randomized controlled trial involving treatment comparisons, establishing the clinical trial context for the patient population.\n\nAnswer: Yes\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not report any information related to HIV sequences or individuals with prior ARV drug exposure.\n\nRationale: The study is centered around a trial for treatment-experienced patients but does not correlate any HIV sequences or sequencing results with prior drug exposure data.\n\nAnswer: No\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The study indicates that the baseline ART regimen of most patients included two NRTIs and one NNRTI, but does not specifically link this to sample sequencing.\n\nRationale: Although drug classes are mentioned in the context of the patient's treatment history, there is no connection to sequencing activities or data provided, resulting in no specific relevance to the question.\n\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\nQuestion: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The paper outlines that the baseline antiretroviral regimen predominantly included two NRTIs and one NNRTI but does not specify the exact drugs used in the treatment.\n\nRationale: While it mentions drug classes, without naming specific drugs, there is no clear answer for which drugs were administered to individuals prior to the study.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n\"\"\""}
