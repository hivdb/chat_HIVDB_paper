The first generation of integrase inhibitors recently\napproved or currently in late-stage clinical trials shows great promise\nfor the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but\nvirus is expected to develop resistance to these drugs. Therefore, we\nused a novel resistance selection protocol to follow the emergence of\nresistant HIV in the presence of the integrase inhibitor elvitegravir\n(GS-9137). We find the primary resistance-conferring mutations to be\nQ148R, E92Q, and T66I and demonstrate that they confer a reduction in\nsusceptibility not only to elvitegravir but also to raltegravir\n(MK-0518) and other integrase inhibitors. The locations of the mutations\nare highlighted in the catalytic sites of integrase, and we correlate\nthe mutations with expected drug-protein contacts. In addition,\nmutations that do not confer reduced susceptibility when present alone\n(H114Y, L74M, R20K, A128T, E138K, and S230R) are also discussed in\nrelation to their position in the catalytic core domain and their\nproximity to known structural features of integrase. These data broaden\nthe understanding of antiviral resistance against integrase inhibitors\nand may give insight facilitating the discovery of second-generation\ncompounds.\n\n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Antiviral compounds.\n\nEVG (GS-9137) ( 30 ), RAL (MK-0518) ( 1 ), L-870,810 ( 19 ), PACA (a\n3-hydroxy-4-oxo-4,6,7,8,9,10-hexahydro-pyrimido\\[1,2-a\\]azepine-2-carboxylamide)\n( 3 ), PICA (a 9H-pyrido\\[3,4-b\\]indole-3-carboxamide) ( 23 ), L-731,988\n( 28 ), and the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor zidovudine (\n21 ) were obtained from commercial suppliers or were synthesized\nin-house. Chemical structures are shown in Fig. ​ Fig.1 1 .\n\nFIG. 1.\n\nStructure of seven different IN inhibitors. (1) Elvitegravir. (2)\nRaltegravir. (3) L-870,810. (4) PACA. (5) PICA. (6) L-731,988.\n\n### Cells and viruses.\n\nThe human T-lymphoblastoid cell line MT4 was kindly provided by Naoki\nYamamoto (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, AIDS Research\nCenter, Tokyo, Japan). The cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium\nsupplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM l\n-glutamine, 0.1% NaHCO ~3~ , and antibiotics (0.02% gentamicin and 0.8%\nG418) and incubated in a humidified incubator with a 5% CO ~2~\natmosphere at 37°C.\n\nMT4-LTR-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) cells were obtained by\ntransfecting MT4 cells with a selectable construct encompassing the\ncoding sequences for the HIV LTR as a promoter for the expression of\nEGFP and subsequent selection of permanently transfected cells.\n\nMT4-cytomegalovirus (CMV)-EGFP cells were obtained by selection for\npermanently transformed MT4 cells with a CMV-EGFP reporter gene.\n\nHIV-1 IIIB was provided by Guido van der Groen (Institute of Tropical\nMedicine, Antwerp, Belgium). HIV-1 molecular clone pHXB2D was provided\nby the Centre for AIDS Reagents (ARP206; Brussels, Belgium).\n\nSDMs of IN coding sequences were constructed in the pUC19-5′HXB2D vector\n(XbaI-SalI fragment of pHXB2D), containing the HIV-1 clone HXB2D IN\ncoding sequence, by using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit\n(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and high-performance liquid\nchromatography-purified primers (Genset Oligos, La Jolla, CA). Altered\nplasmid sequences were confirmed by dideoxyribose sequencing.\n\n### Generation of the SDM virus stocks.\n\nMT4 cells were subcultured at a density of 250,000 cells/ml on the day\nbefore transfection. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in\nphosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 3.1 × 10 ^6^ cells/ml. A\n0.8-ml portion (2.5 × 10 ^6^ cells/ml) was used for each transfection.\nTransfections were performed with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad,\nHercules, CA) with 0.4-cm electrode cuvettes (Bio-Rad). Cells were\nelectroporated with 10 μg of SalI-linearized pUC19-3′HXB2D (SalI-XbaI\nfragment of pHXB2D) and 5 μg of SalI-digested SDM at 250 μF and 300 V,\nfollowed by a 30-min incubation at room temperature. Ten milliliters of\nfresh culture medium was then added to the suspension of transfected\ncells, and incubation was performed at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere\nwith 5% CO ~2~ . Cell cultures were monitored for the appearance of\ncytopathic effect (CPE). At virus breakthrough (full CPE), culture\nsupernatant was typically harvested by centrifugation at 8 to 10 days\nafter transfection and was stored at −80°C for subsequent drug\nsusceptibility determination.\n\n### Antiviral assays.\n\nThe antiviral activity of different inhibitors was determined in a\ncell-based HIV-1 replication assay. Briefly, MT4-LTR-EGFP cells (150,000\ncells/ml) were infected with HIV-1 (IIIB, HXB2D, selected viruses, or\nsite-directed mutant strains; multiplicity of infection \\[MOI\\] of\n0.0025) in the presence or absence of inhibitor. After 3 days of\nincubation, the inhibition of HIV replication was quantified by\nmeasuring EGFP fluorescence, and expressed as the inhibitor\nconcentration required for 50% inhibition of HIV-1 replication in cell\nculture (EC ~50~ ). The cytotoxicity of inhibitors was determined in\nparallel on mock-infected MT4-CMV-EGFP cells (150,000 cells/ml) cultured\nin the presence or absence of test compound concentrations (data not\nshown). After 3 days of incubation, inhibition of cell proliferation was\nquantified by measuring the EGFP fluorescence and expressed as the\ncompound concentration that inhibits cell growth by 50% (cytotoxicity).\n\n### Genotyping.\n\nViral RNA was extracted from culture supernatant or virus stock using a\nNucliSens easyMAG apparatus (bioMérieux, Marcy l\\' Etoile, France), a\nhigh-throughput automated nucleic acid extraction system. cDNA encoding\nreverse transcriptase and IN was generated with Expand Reverse\nTranscriptase (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), followed by\namplification of the IN region by nested PCR (1,456 bp). PCR products\nwere genotyped by automated population-based full-sequence analysis (ABI\nPrism BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing; Applied Biosystems, Foster\nCity, CA). Sequencing results were reported as amino acid changes\ncompared with the HIV-1 IIIB wild-type reference sequence. Mutations\npresent in more than 25% of the total virus population could be detected\nas a mixture with the wild-type virus. HIV-1 IIIB and HIV-1 HXB2D are\ntwo distinct wild-type strains with similar phenotypes for the IN\ninhibitors tested in this study. These two wild-type virus strains\ndiffer genetically in three residues of the IN sequence. The HIV-1 IIIB\nIN sequence contains residues T124, D232, and V265, whereas the HIV-1\nHXB2D IN sequence contains A124, N232, and A265. Moreover, D232N and\nA124T have been reported as IN polymorphisms in HIV-1 ( 25 ). Starting\nfrom HIV-1 IIIB, mutations T124A, D232N, and V265A were observed in the\ngenotypes of viruses selected with EVG. As these mutations are\nconsistent with the observed polymorphisms and differences between the\nHIV-1 IIIB and HIV-1 HXB2D IN sequences and no large EC ~50~ difference\nwas observed for the tested IN compounds between the strains, these\nmutations did not contribute to the IN resistance and consequently have\nbeen omitted from the results and discussion sections.\n\n### Classical in vitro selection experiments.\n\nClassical in vitro selection was performed as described before ( 35 ).\nBriefly, in a T25 tissue culture flask, MT4-LTR-EGFP cells were\npropagated in a volume of 10 ml and infected with HIV-1 wild-type strain\nIIIB (0.01 to 0.001 the 50% cell culture infectious dose) in the\npresence of EVG at a concentration of 5 nM. Cultures were examined every\n3 to 4 days for signs of virus replication. Upon virus breakthrough, the\nsupernatant was collected, and an aliquot was used to infect fresh\ncultures in the presence of a twofold higher concentration of EVG than\nwas used to infect the previous culture. This procedure was repeated up\nto an EVG concentration of 10 μM. Viral replication was assessed by\nmicroscopic scoring of the cytopathogenicity and virus-induced\nfluorescence, and viral breakthrough was defined as microscopic evidence\nof extensive viral replication in all cell clusters (full CPE). Samples\nfor genotyping and phenotyping were obtained from the harvested\nsupernatant.\n\n### Automated in vitro selection experiments in 96-well plates.\n\nIn vitro selection was performed in 96-well plates, with each row\nrepresenting a separate IVS experiment (Fig. ​ (Fig.2). 2 ). MT4-LTR-EGFP\ncells (400,000 cells/ml) and HIV-1 IIIB (MOI of 0.01) were added to the\nwells of a 96-well plate containing a serial 1:2 dilution range of EVG\n(3 μM to 3 nM), and plates were incubated in a humidified incubator with\na 5% CO ~2~ atmosphere at 37°C. After 3 to 4 days, 30 μl of\nvirus-containing supernatant was harvested from each well and split in\nthree 10-μl portions. These portions were used to infect the 150 μl of\nfresh cells in the wells of the same row in a new compound plate with,\nrespectively, 1× (same as originating well), 2×, and 4× the EVG\nconcentration. This procedure was repeated every 3 to 4 days. When virus\nreplication was evident in wells at the highest concentration of EVG,\nthe supernatant was harvested and used for genotyping, phenotyping, and\npropagating new virus stock. In contrast with the classical IVS\nexperiments, where compound concentration is only increased at viral\nbreakthrough, this method uses a protocol where the virus is challenged\nwith an increased compound concentration at each passage.\n\nFIG. 2.\n\nAutomated IVS in 96-well plates. (A) A stock of 96-well plates was\ngenerated and stored at −20°C. Each row of a plate contained a 1:2\ndilution series of EVG, with the highest concentration (3 μM) in column\n1 and the lowest concentration (3 nM) in column 11. MT4-LTR-EGFP cells\nand HIV-1 IIIB were added to row 1-12 and row 1-11, respectively. Column\n12 was used as a cell control. Every 3 to 4 days, a new growth cycle was\ninitiated. To this end, a compound plate was thawed, and fresh cells\nwere added. Next, virus-containing supernatant (SN) was harvested from\neach well of the previous plate and split in three portions that were\nused to infect cells in the wells on the same row in the new plate with,\nrespectively, 1× (same as originating well), 2×, and 4× the EVG\nconcentration. When 100% virus breakthrough was observed in the wells of\ncolumn 1 (3 μM), virus was harvested for genotyping. (B) Every passage,\na fluorescent scan was generated from the plates just before the\nrecultivation cycle. Pictures for the plates of passage 6, 9, 11, 16,\n26, and 27 are shown.\n\n### Replication kinetics of SDMs and selected HIV-1 strains.\n\nMT4 cells (120,000 cells) were infected with HIV-1 (IIIB, HXB2D,\nselected viruses, or SDM viruses; MOI of 0.0001) in the absence of\ninhibitor. Every day, cells were examined for the appearance of\nHIV-1-induced CPE. In addition, aliquots of cell-free supernatants were\ntaken for determination of viral p24 levels (HIV-1 p24 enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA).\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Classical in vitro selection of EVG-resistant viruses.\n\nIn the classical IVS experiment performed in tissue culture flasks, the\nvirus was propagated over 41 passages (144 days) while the concentration\nof EVG was gradually increased from 5 nM up to 10 μM. The IN-encoding\nregion of the *pol* gene of the viruses, selected at different passages,\nwas sequenced. Multiple mutations were observed in these viruses in\ncomparison with the IN sequence of wild-type HIV-1 IIIB (Table ​ (Table1\n1 and Fig. ​ Fig.3 3 ).\n\nFIG. 3.\n\nClassical IVS of EVG-resistant HIV-1 strains. MT4-LTR-EGFP cells were\ninfected with HIV-1 IIIB (black star) and grown in the presence of EVG.\nCells were passaged every 3 to 4 days (small squares). When full virus\nbreakthrough was observed (black dots), viruses were harvested, and the\nconcentration of EVG was doubled. Genotypes of harvested viruses are\nindicated next to the black dots; phenotypes (EVG EC ~50~ ) of viruses\nIIIB/GS-9137(#9), IIIB/GS-9137(#13), IIIB/GS-9137(#22), and\nIIIB/GS-9137(#41) were determined using a cellular antiviral assay.\n\n\nThe first two mutations to emerge were T66I and E92Q after 5 and 9\npassages, respectively. These mutations were undetectable from passage\n31 and onwards. Q148R and A128T developed when 1.28 μM EVG (22 passages)\nwas used for selection, and D10E appeared after 25 passages, but the\nlatter mutation was not observed in the final viral population (41\npassages). After 31 passages, mutation H114Y emerged. The final viral\npool, emerging after 41 passages (144 days) at a concentration of 10.24\nμM EVG, contained the IN sequence H114Y/A128T/Q148R.\n\n### Automated in vitro selection of EVG-resistant viruses.\n\nA recently described method that uses an automated IVS approach in\n96-well plates (D. Jochmans, M. Van Ginderen, I. De Baere, S.\nHallenberger, and G. Kraus, presented at the 16th International HIV Drug\nResistance Workshop, Barbados, West Indies, 12 to 16 June 2007) was used\nto select EVG-resistant strains starting from HIV-1 IIIB. Here, the\nvirus is challenged with an increased compound concentration at each\npassage and not only at virus breakthrough, as is done for classical\nIVS. Using this method, eight parallel IVS experiments were performed\nsimultaneously. Virus samples were taken at every passage and genotyped\nto identify mutations. Viral propagation continued up to a final\nconcentration of 3 μM EVG. The genotypes observed at this concentration\nare shown in Table ​ Table2. 2 . All viruses were phenotyped to reveal\nchanges in susceptibility to EVG and other inhibitors (see Fig. ​ Fig.5).\n5 ). Virus was able to grow at the final concentration of 3 μM EVG after\n16 to 27 passages or 56 to 95 days (Table ​ (Table2). 2 ). A number of\nthe mutations observed in the viruses selected with EVG have been\nobserved in a phase 2b study with this IN inhibitor (e.g., Q148R, E92Q,\nT66I/A, and E138K) (D. McColl, S. Fransen, S. Gupta, N. Parkin, N.\nMargot, S. Chuck, A. Cheng, and M. Miller, presented at the 11th\nEuropean Aids Conference, Madrid, Spain, 24 to 27 October 2007),\nsupporting the relevance of this automated IVS method to clinical data.\n\nFIG. 5.\n\nCross-resistance of the HIV-1 selected strains (automated IVS) for\ndifferent IN inhibitors. The regrown viruses from the automated IVS were\ntested for susceptibility to EVG and other IN inhibitors. Relative\nchanges in susceptibility of the viruses compared with wild-type IIIB\nvirus are displayed on the graph.\n\n### Evaluation of phenotypic (cross-) resistance of the selected HIV-1 strains.\n\nTo confirm that the selected HIV strains (Table ​ (Table1) 1 ) were\nindeed resistant to the drug, we determined the susceptibility of\nviruses IIIB/GS-9137(#9), IIIB/GS-9137(#13), IIIB/GS-9137(#22), and\nIIIB/GS-9137(#41) to EVG (Fig. ​ (Fig.4). 4 ). In parallel, the\nsusceptibility of the resistant viruses to other HIV-1 IN inhibitors,\nincluding RAL, PACA, L-870,810, PICA, and L-731,988, were determined\n(Fig. ​ (Fig.4 4 ).\n\nFIG. 4.\n\nSusceptibility of the HIV-1 selected strains (classical IVS) to\nantiviral IN inhibitors. The susceptibilities of the HIV strains to the\npresence of high EVG concentrations were determined. Relative changes in\nthe susceptibility of the viruses IIIB/GS-9137(#9), IIIB/GS-9137(#13),\nIIIB/GS-9137(#22), and IIIB/GS-9137(#41) compared with wild-type IIIB\nvirus are displayed for the different IN inhibitors.\n\nStrain IIIB/GS-9137(#9) (with the mutations T66T/I E92E/Q) showed a\nsixfold reduced susceptibility to EVG. This virus conferred little or no\n(one- to threefold) reduced susceptibility to the other IN inhibitors.\nThe virus IIIB/GS-9137(#13) (E92Q) was 22 times less sensitive to EVG\nthan the wild-type HIV-1 IIIB, and the susceptibility of this virus to\nthe other IN compounds was reduced 5- to 13-fold. Virus\nIIIB/GS-9137(#22) (T66T/I E92E/Q A128A/T Q148Q/R) was 62 times less\nsusceptible to EVG. A moderate reduction in susceptibility to PACA, in\ncomparison with the previous selected virus, IIIB/GS-9137(#13), was\nobserved. This was not the case for the other IN inhibitors, RAL,\nL-870,810, PICA, and L-731,988, where no or only a small reduction was\nseen. The finally selected strain IIIB/GS-9137(#41) (H114Y A128T Q148R)\nshowed a 217-fold reduction in susceptibility to EVG. This virus was,\nrespectively, 84 and 33 times less susceptible to PACA and L-870,810\nwhile only a 15- to 17-fold reduced susceptibility to RAL, PICA, and\nL-731,988 was observed.\n\nThe eight resistant viruses from the automated IVS were recultured and\ntested for susceptibility to EVG. Susceptibility to the panel of other\nIN inhibitors was also determined in order to establish the degree of\ncross-resistance (Fig. ​ (Fig.5). 5 ). The regrown viruses were genotyped\nto confirm the previously observed genotypes (Table ​ (Table2). 2 ). The\nmutations E138E/K and Q148Q/R, present in virus 3 (T66T/I A128A/T\nE138E/K Q148Q/R S230R), were not observed after reculturing, whereas\nT66T/I developed to T66I. The mutation S230R present in virus 3 and\nvirus 7 (R20R/K T66I L74L/M S230R) was observed as a mixture S230S/R\nafter reculturing.\n\nVirus 1 (E138K Q148R) was 162 times less susceptible to EVG and was\nreduced in susceptibility to the rest of the panel of IN inhibitors.\nViruses 2, 3, and 4 showed large (91- to 63-fold) reductions in\nsusceptibility to EVG. These viruses were also 5 to 49 times less\nsusceptible to the remaining IN inhibitors. Virus 5 (E92E/Q E138E/K\nQ148Q/R) and virus 6 (T66T/A E92Q) were, respectively, 43- and 39-fold\nless sensitive to EVG. Both viruses were also less susceptible to the\nother IN inhibitors (4- to 19-fold). Virus 7 (R20K/R T66I L74L/M\nS230R/S) and virus 8 (T66I) showed, respectively, a 34- and 11-fold\nreduction in susceptibility to EVG and nearly wild-type susceptibility\nto RAL, with modest reductions in susceptibility to the other IN\ninhibitors (Fig. ​ (Fig.5 5 ).\n\n### Confirmation of primary resistance mutations.\n\nIn order to identify the primary RAMs, recombinant viruses with single\npoint mutations in the IN sequence were constructed. The IN mutations\nR20K, T66A/I, L74M, E92Q, H114Y, A128T, E138K, Q148R, N155H, and S230R\nwere incorporated as SDMs in the backbone of HIV-1 HXB2D. The resulting\nviruses were phenotyped to determine the change in susceptibility to EVG\nand other IN inhibitors (Fig. ​ (Fig.6 6 ).\n\nFIG. 6.\n\nSusceptibility of HIV-1 IN recombinant clones (SDMs). The displayed IN\nmutations were incorporated as SDMs in the backbone of HIV-1 (HXB2D).\nRelative changes in susceptibility of the viruses for the different\ncompounds are shown on the graph.\n\nThe Q148R mutation conferred large reductions in susceptibilities to\nEVG, RAL, PACA, L-870,810, PICA, and L-731,988, indicating that this\nmutation can confer cross-resistance to a range of IN inhibitors with\ndiverse chemical scaffolds. Furthermore, the E92Q mutation, while\nconferring only a small (threefold) reduction in susceptibility to RAL,\nshowed large reductions in susceptibility to EVG and the other IN\ninhibitors, suggesting that the E92Q mutation is, like Q148R, capable of\ncausing reduced sensitivity to a wide range of IN inhibitors. A T66I\nmutation caused a 33-fold reduction in susceptibility to EVG, but this\nmutant retained nearly wild-type susceptibility to RAL. This mutation\nwas also capable of reducing susceptibility to the other IN inhibitors,\nalbeit to a lesser degree than Q148R and E92Q. The T66A mutation, while\nconferring ninefold reduced susceptibility to EVG, caused only\napproximately twofold reduction in susceptibility to other IN\ninhibitors. No or only a small reduction in virus susceptibility to EVG,\nRAL, or any other IN inhibitor used in this study was seen when the\nimpact of a singular H114Y, L74M, A128T, E138K, S230R, or R20K mutation\nwas tested with SDMs (Fig. ​ (Fig.6). 6 ). E92Q, Q148R, T66I, and N155H\nare the major IN RAMs observed in the EVG clinical trials (D. McColl, et\nal., presented at the 11th European Aids Conference, Madrid, Spain). In\nthis study we selected viruses resistant to EVG, which contained among\nmany mutations the primary RAMs T66I, E92Q, and Q148R. Only the mutation\nN155H was not detected in the mutant viruses obtained in our selection\nexperiments; however, we also investigated the effect of this mutation,\nin the context of an SDM, on the viral susceptibility to our panel of IN\ninhibitors. The reduction in susceptibility to EVG and RAL conferred by\nthe single amino acid change N155H was 32-fold and 8-fold, respectively,\nwhereas the reduction in susceptibility to PACA and L-870,810 was 21-\nand 29-fold, respectively. Only a twofold reduction in viral sensitivity\nto PICA and L-731,988 was conferred by N155H.\n\n### Replication kinetics of mutant HIV-1 viruses.\n\nTo investigate whether the drug-induced mutations affect viral\nreplication capacity, the HIV-1 viruses selected with the classical IVS\nand the recombinant viruses were examined for their ability to replicate\nin MT4 cells in comparison with their respective parental strains.\nReplication kinetics of the selected viruses IIIB/GS-9137(#9),\nIIIB/GS-9137(#13), IIIB/GS-9137(#22), and IIIB/GS-9137(#41) were\ncomparable to the replication of the parental HIV-1 IIIB strain (Fig. ​\n(Fig.7A). 7A ). All recombinant strains showed reduced replication\nfitness in comparison with wild-type HXB2D (Fig. ​ (Fig.7B). 7B ).\nRecombinant viruses with the mutation N155H or A128T showed large\nreductions in p24 production relative to the replication of the\nwild-type HIV-1 HXB2D, while the recombinant virus with the mutation\nE138K had only a moderate reduction in p24 level. The recombinant\nviruses with the single mutation Q148R, E92Q, T66I, T66A, H114Y, L74M,\nR20K, or S230R showed only a small reduction in replication capacity\nrelative to the wild type.\n\nFIG. 7.\n\nReplication kinetics of mutant viruses. MT4 cells were infected with the\nselected viruses (classical IVS) (A) or recombinant viruses (B) at an\nMOI of 0.0001. Cells were evaluated microscopically for HIV-induced CPE,\nand viral p24 levels were determined daily in cell-free supernatant.\nExperiments were done in duplicate.\n\n### Location of the mutations associated with resistance to EVG.\n\nThe location of the mutations associated with resistance to EVG,\ndiscussed above, were highlighted on a three-dimensional docking model\nof EVG with the IN catalytic core domain, based on the model of Savarino\n( 31 ) (Fig. ​ (Fig.8). 8 ). Savarino generated a surrogate platform for\nmolecular docking of EVG and other IN strand transfer inhibitors by\ntransposing the one-metal structure of Goldgur et al. ( 16 ) onto a\ntwo-metal model of the HIV-1 IN catalytic core domain, after performing\na structural alignment. Importantly, the primary mutations which cause\nthe largest changes in susceptibility to EVG, i.e., Q148R, E92Q, T66I,\nand N155H, are located proximally to the catalytic triad represented by\nthe D,D(35)E motif of IN. The position of the mutations L74M, H114Y,\nA128T, and E138K are also shown on the model and are more distant from\nthe active site. These mutations do not confer large changes in\nsusceptibility to EVG (Fig. ​ (Fig.6), 6 ), and their role in the\ndevelopment of resistance remains a topic of speculation. The R20K and\nS230R mutations lie in the terminal domains of IN and are, therefore,\nnot shown in our model of the catalytic core domain.\n\nFIG. 8.\n\nMapping of the IN mutations within the HIV-1 IN catalytic site. A\nthree-dimensional docking model of the catalytic core domain of HIV-1 IN\nwith EVG (orange), based on the two-metal model of Savarino ( 31 ) is\nshown. The catalytic triad residues (D64, D116, and E152) are shown in\ngreen, and the magnesium ions are in blue. The indole ring of 5CITEP\n(cyan) is used as a surrogate for the adenine of the terminal residue of\nthe 3′ processed viral DNA. Amino acid residues conferring resistance to\nEVG as primary mutations are shown in red while the remaining mutations\nare highlighted in yellow.\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nHIV IN is a recently validated viral target for treating HIV infection\nand preventing AIDS. Currently, the IN inhibitor EVG is in the advanced\nstages of human clinical trials, and RAL has been approved recently.\nThese two IN inhibitors show excellent antiretroviral efficacy in the\nclinic in both naive and treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients (\n8 ). However, viral strains resistant to the IN inhibitors will\nundoubtedly emerge, reducing the effectiveness of these drugs in\npatients. As with other classes of antiretrovirals, it is likely that\nthe first generation of IN inhibitors will be complemented by a second\ngeneration. One of the attributes of any second-generation IN inhibitor\nwill be the activity of the new drug against mutant viruses arising from\nthe first-generation IN inhibitors. Thus, the identification of primary\nresistance mutations and the degree to which they confer resistance and\nof secondary or compensatory mutations is of critical importance to\nfuture generations of IN inhibitors.\n\nTwo different methods for the selection of viruses resistant to EVG were\nemployed here. In addition to a classical IVS experiment, we report a\nresistance selection protocol in 96-well plates, automated IVS (Fig. ​\n(Fig.2), 2 ), where each row of the plate contains an independent\nselection experiment. This protocol enabled us to perform up to eight\nIVS experiments in parallel, which gives a greater throughput than the\nclassical selection experiments and results in larger data sets. The\neight viruses obtained using automated IVS with EVG contained distinct\ngenotypes, demonstrating that automated IVS can serve to increase\ndiversity of results obtained by enabling the emergence of complementary\nor alternative resistance pathways. Furthermore, the novel method uses a\nprotocol whereby the virus is challenged with an increased compound\nconcentration at each passage and not only at virus breakthrough, as is\ndone for classical IVS.\n\nTo gain further understanding of the antiviral (cross-) resistance\npatterns and mechanisms of EVG, the HIV-1 IIIB strains selected in the\npresence of increasing concentrations of this IN inhibitor were analyzed\ngenotypically and phenotypically at different stages of the selection\nprocess. In total, nine selection experiments with EVG were performed,\none by classical IVS and eight by automated IVS. At least one of the\nfour mutations, T66A, T66I, E92Q, and Q148R, was present in the nine\nresulting viruses (Tables ​ (Tables1 1 and ​ and2 2 and Fig. ​ Fig.3). 3 ).\nThese four mutations conferred resistance to EVG, which was confirmed by\nrecombinant viruses with SDMs. The changes in susceptibility due to the\nQ148R and E92Q mutations were 96-fold and 57-fold, respectively, whereas\nthe changes conferred by the T66I and T66A mutations were 33-fold and\n9-fold, respectively. Hence, these mutations could also be considered\nprimary mutations associated with EVG resistance. The SDMs were also\nassessed for their susceptibility to other IN inhibitors, including RAL,\nPACA, L-870,810, PICA, and L-731,988. Q148R yielded a 15-fold reduction\nin susceptibility to RAL. Whereas E92Q and T66A displayed, respectively,\na threefold and twofold reduction in susceptibility to RAL, T66I did not\naffect sensitivity to RAL. Taking into account all IN inhibitors (Fig. ​\n(Fig.6), 6 ), the Q148R mutation is proposed as the most important RAM\nfor a wide range of IN inhibitors with diverse chemical scaffolds. The\nE92Q mutation is identified as a mutation capable of conferring reduced\nsusceptibility to diverse IN inhibitors, albeit with a small reduction\nin susceptibility to RAL. In addition, T66I confers reduced\nsusceptibility to the IN inhibitors but to a lesser degree than both\nQ148R and E92Q. Mutation T66A confers reduced susceptibility to EVG but\nnot to the other IN inhibitors.\n\nThe mutations H114Y, L74M, R20K, A128T, E138K, and S230R were observed\naccompanying one or more of the four primary mutations. In the context\nof single mutations in SDMs, however, they resulted in little or no\nchange in EVG susceptibility (Fig. ​ (Fig.6). 6 ). Moreover, these\nmutations did not cause large changes to RAL, PACA, L-870,810, PICA, or\nL-731,988.\n\nThe mutation T66I has been previously reported as a resistance mutation\nconferring reduced susceptibility to the diketo acid inhibitors S-1360 (\n14 ) and L-731,988 ( 20 ). Shimura ( 33 ) also reported T66I and E92Q as\nRAMs of EVG. However, in those studies the Q148R mutation was not\ndetected after selection with EVG. Other studies already identified\nQ148R to be associated with in vivo resistance to RAL (D. J. Hazuda, M.\nMiller, B. Y. Nguyen, and J. Zhao, presented at the XVI International\nHIV Drug Resistance Workshop, Barbados, West Indies, 12 to 16 June 2007)\nand to EVG (D. McColl, et al., presented at the 11th European Aids\nConference, Madrid, Spain). Also N155H has been reported as a primary IN\nresistance mutation among patients with virologic failure for RAL ( 26 )\nor EVG. We did not select the latter mutation, but our N155H-containing\nSDM showed a 32-fold reduction in EVG susceptibility, underscoring its\nimportance. Shimura et al. ( 33 ) previously selected HIV-1 strains in\nthe presence of EVG. The selected strains showed two distinct resistance\npathways: one pathway consisting of T66I, Q95K, E138K, Q146P, and S147G\nand a second pathway comprising the mutations H51Y, E92Q, S147G, and\nE157Q in the IN sequence. Our experimental data confirm the emergence of\nE138K and T66I but not Q95K, Q146P, H51Y, S147G, and E157Q, highlighting\nthe need for further research into the resistance pathways employed by\nHIV to evade drug pressure from IN inhibitors. It is possible that new\nmutations will emerge from other resistance selection experiments, and\ndata from clinical trials will likely indicate which mutations are the\nmost significant.\n\nThe selected (classical IVS) and recombinant strains were examined for\ntheir ability to replicate in MT4 cells in comparison with their\nrespective wild-type strains (Fig. ​ (Fig.7). 7 ). The four selected\nviruses, IIIB/GS-9137(#9), IIIB/GS-9137(#13), IIIB/GS-9137(#22), and\nIIIB/GS-9137(#41), were similar to the wild type in their replication\ncapacity. The recombinant viruses with the single mutation Q148R, E92Q,\nT66I, T66A, H114Y, L74M, R20K, or S230R showed a moderate or small\nreduction in replication capacity relative to the wild type. A large\nreduction in replication compared with the wild type was observed for\nthe viruses with the single mutation N155H or A128T. As N155H is a\nprimary IN resistance mutation among patients with virologic failure for\nIN inhibitors, it is possible that additional mutations might have\ndeveloped after the N155H mutation was generated to compensate for the\nreduced replication. Clearly, more investigation will be necessary to\nidentify possible compensatory mutations and their role on the behavior\nof the IN enzyme.\n\nRecently, Savarino ( 31 ) reported an in silico docking simulation of\nHIV-1 IN with several IN inhibitors, including EVG. The model was\nderived from an X-ray structure of 5CITEP\n\\[1-(5-chloroindol-3-yl)-3-(tetrazoyl)-1,3-propandione-ene\\] bound to\nthe catalytic core domain of IN ( 16 ), with two magnesium ions into the\nactive site. The indole ring of 5CITEP was used as a surrogate for the\nadenine of the terminal residue of the 3′-processed viral DNA. As a best\ndocking pose for EVG, Savarino suggested that the β-hydroxyl carboxylate\nchelates the magnesium ion between D64 and E152 and that the hydroxylic\noxygen in the isobutyl substituent coordinates the second magnesium ion.\nFigure ​ Figure8 8 shows the in silico docking model of Savarino, with\nthe mutations acquired by selection with EVG highlighted. The primary\nresistance mutations Q148R, E92Q, T66I/A, and N155H are located adjacent\nto the catalytic triad of IN and are surrounded by the more distant\npotentially secondary mutations H114Y, L74M, A128T, and E138K. In this\nmodel the isobutyl substituent of EVG is oriented toward E92, and the\nhydroxyl in the isobutyl substituent replaces one of the water molecules\nthrough which E92 coordinates the magnesium ion between D64 and D116.\nTherefore, it is not surprising to see that the primary mutation E92Q\nconfers a substantial decrease in susceptibility to EVG. According to\nthe model, there is no direct interaction between T66 and the compound,\nbut given the short distance between T66 and EVG, a water-mediated\ninteraction, through which a T66I/A mutation might have an effect, is\nplausible.\n\nThe effect of the Q148R mutation on catalytic activity could be\nexplained in two ways. In a first hypothesis, Q148R reduces the affinity\nof the enzyme for magnesium ( 11 ). Q148 is located in a flexible loop\n(residues 141 to 148). By X-ray crystallography, Greenwald and\ncolleagues ( 17 ) showed that mutations in the flexible loop could have\nan effect on the catalytic activity. Such mutations would also be\nexpected to modulate the activity of active-site inhibitors. In\naddition, a recent IN inhibitor binding model concluded that strand\ntransfer inhibitors bind close to the flexible loop and that inhibitor\nbinding impedes loop mobility and hence catalytic activity ( 7 ).\nTherefore, the flexible loop and thus Q148 are important for strand\ntransfer inhibitor binding ( 16 ). According to Dicker and coworkers (\n11 ), the Q148R mutation shifts the flexible loop equilibrium to a state\nthat hampers magnesium binding by E152. Consequently, the susceptibility\nto inhibitors that are believed to chelate the two magnesium ions is\nreduced, but viral replication and fitness are also affected. Secondly,\nQ148R has an influence on the binding of the viral LTR ( 15 , 22 ). In\nthe model of Savarino, Q148 is in close contact with the indole ring of\n5CITEP (Fig. ​ (Fig.8), 8 ), which shows an interaction between Q148 and\nthe terminal adenine of the 3′ processed viral DNA. A plausible\nexplanation for the effect of the Q148R mutation speculates on this\ndirect interaction ( 15 , 22 ). Mutations that shift the equilibrium of\nbound viral DNA can interfere with the effect of inhibitors ( 32 ).\nPrevious hypotheses about Q148R all share the common features that both\ncatalytic activity and affinity for the inhibitor are reduced. This\nleads to a reduction in viral susceptibility to EVG and RAL and also\nresults in a penalty on fitness and replication efficiency of the virus\nthat nevertheless does not preclude its selection in the clinic (D.\nMcColl, et al., presented at the 11th European Aids Conference, Madrid,\nSpain).\n\nThe amino acids at positions L74, H114, E138, and A128 are distal to the\ncatalytic site (Fig. ​ (Fig.8) 8 ) and are not expected to make direct\ncontact with the inhibitor. No large susceptibility changes to EVG or\nRAL were conferred by L74M, H114Y, E138K, and A128T when the mutations\nwere included singularly as SDMs (Fig. ​ (Fig.6). 6 ). These are possibly\ncompensatory mutations, where the fitness or replicative capacity\npenalty resulting from the primary resistance mutation may be partially\ncompensated by changes in the backbone of the protein and in the\ngeometry of the catalytic triad. It is possible that the L74M mutation\n(located on β-sheet β2) could influence the positioning of D64 (located\non β-sheet β1 and via H bonds interacting with V75), thereby interfering\nwith the coordination of magnesium by the catalytic triad (Fig. ​\n(Fig.8). 8 ). Additionally, H114Y may impart a subtle influence on D116,\nanother important residue in the catalytic triad. The residue E138 is\ndistal from the catalytic site located on β-strand β5 that is parallel\nto β-strand β4, on which H114 and D116 are situated (Fig. ​ (Fig.8) 8 )\nand is unlikely to contact the inhibitor.\n\nA better knowledge of the enzymatic activity, replication kinetics, and\nfitness of IN inhibitor-resistant mutant viruses and enzymes would\nimprove the understanding of the resistance mechanism of the RAMs and\nallow the identification of compensatory mutations. New mutations will\nlikely arise from other IVS experiments and from clinical trials.\nTogether, these data will enhance our understanding of the nature of the\nbinding of IN inhibitors and therefore contribute to a low-resolution\nstructural model that may resemble the IN-DNA-inhibitor complex and\noffer a tool for the development of second-generation IN inhibitors.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 20421122\nQuestion ID: 16\nQuestion: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: Abstract\nEmergence of resistance to raltegravir reduces its treatment efficacy in HIV-1-infected patients. To delineate the effect of resistance mutations on viral susceptibility to integrase inhibitors, in vitro resistance selections with raltegravir and with MK-2048, an integrase inhibitor with a second-generation-like resistance profile, were performed. Mutation Q148R arose in four out of six raltegravir-selected resistant viruses. In addition, mutations Q148K and N155H were selected. In the same time frame, no mutations were selected with MK-2048. Q148H/K/R and N155H conferred resistance to raltegravir, but only minor changes in susceptibility to MK-2048. V54I, a previously unreported mutation, selected with raltegravir, was identified as a possible compensation mutation. Mechanisms by which N155H, Q148H/K/R, Y143R and E92Q confer resistance are proposed based on a structural model of integrase. These data improve the understanding of resistance against raltegravir and cross-resistance to MK-2048 and other integrase inhibitors, which will aid in the discovery of second-generation integrase inhibitors.\nRationale: The paper mentioned in vitro reistance selection, and all sequences were generated using site-directed mutation technology, which means the sequence were not from clinical samples.\nAnswer: Not reported\n\nPMID: 20421122\nQuestion ID: 13\nQuestion: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\nEvidence: Primary mutations selected in vitro with raltegravir confer large fold changes in susceptibility to first-generation integrase inhibitors, but minor fold changes to inhibitors with second-generation resistance profiles.

It is an authentic inhibitor of HIV-1 integration,\nsince treatment of infected cells results in an elevation of two-long\nterminal repeat circles and a decrease of integration junctions. GS-9160\nhas potent and selective antiviral activity in primary human T\nlymphocytes producing a 50% effective concentration (EC ~50~ ) of ∼2 nM,\nwith a selectivity index (50% cytotoxic concentration/EC ~50~ ) of\n∼2,000. The antiviral potency of GS-9160 decreased by 6- to 10-fold in\nthe presence of human serum. The antiviral activity of GS-9160 is\nsynergistic in combination with representatives from three different\nclasses of antiviral drugs, namely HIV-1 protease inhibitors,\nnonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and nucleotide reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitors. Viral resistance selections performed with\nGS-9160 yielded a novel pattern of mutations within the catalytic core\ndomain of IN; E92V emerged initially, followed by L74M. While E92V as a\nsingle mutant conferred 12-fold resistance against GS-9160, L74M had no\neffect as a single mutant. Together, these mutations conferred 67-fold\nresistance to GS-9160, indicating that L74M may potentiate the\nresistance caused by E92V. The pharmacokinetic profile of GS-9160 in\nhealthy human volunteers revealed that once-daily dosing was not likely\nto achieve antiviral efficacy; hence, the clinical development of this\ncompound was discontinued.\n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Compounds.\n\nGS-9160 and capravirine (CPV) were synthesized at Gilead Sciences, Inc.\nL-870,810 was contract synthesized by Combi-Blocks Inc. (San Diego, CA).\nGS-9137 was supplied by Japan Tobacco Inc. Amprenavir (APV), lopinavir\n(LPV), atazanavir, and nelfinavir were isolated from commercial tablets.\nTenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) was synthesized in the process\nchemistry department of Gilead Sciences (lot no. 4331-05-XK-1).\nEmtricitabine (FTC) was obtained from Triangle Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n(now a part of Gilead Sciences). Efavirenz (EFV) was purchased from\nToronto Research Chemicals Inc. (catalog no. E425000; North York,\nOntario, Canada). 3TC was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals Inc.\n(catalog no. M-975; Brea, CA). Zidovudine (AZT) (catalog no. A-2169),\nstavudine (d4T) (catalog no. D-1413), and ribavirin (RBV) (catalog no.\nR-9644) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).\n\n### Cells.\n\nMT-2 cells were obtained from Stanford University, and MT-4 cells were\nobtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program\n(Germantown, MD). SupT1 cells were obtained from the American Type\nCulture Collection (Rockville, MD). MT-2, MT-4, and SupT1 cells were\nmaintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated\nfetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. The SODk1 2G cell line that\nproduces vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein-pseudotyped viral\nparticles used in single-cycle infection was licensed from the Salk\nInstitute, La Jolla, CA. ( 3 , 26 ). SODk1 2G cells were maintained in\nDulbecco modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% tetracycline-free\nFBS (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), 1 mM glutamine, 1 mM pyruvate, 1\nμg/ml doxycycline, and antibiotics. Production of the pseudotyped\nparticles from SODk1 2G cells has been previously described ( 26 ).\n\nHuman CD4-positive T lymphocytes (T cells) were isolated from human\nbuffy coats obtained from healthy volunteers (Stanford Medical School\nBlood Center, Stanford, CA). Cells from these buffy coats were\ncentrifuged over endotoxin-free Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare Life\nSciences, Piscataway, NJ), and the peripheral blood mononuclear cell\nlayer was harvested. Residual red blood cells were removed by ammonium\nchloride hypotonic cell lysis. Total peripheral blood mononuclear cells\nwere cultured in RPMI medium with Glutamax (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)\nsupplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml\nstreptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin P\n(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and 10 U/ml interleukin-2 (Roche,\nIndianapolis, IN). After 48 h of culture, the nonadherent cell\nsuspension was harvested and centrifuged. The CD4-positive T lymphocytes\nwere isolated from the pellet using anti-CD4-coated microbeads (Miltenyi\nBiotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer\\'s\ninstructions.\n\n### Viruses.\n\nHIV-1 strain IIIb was obtained from Advanced Biotechnologies Inc.\n(Columbia, MD). The nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor\n(NRTI)-resistant virus containing mutation K65R in reverse transcriptase\n(RT) was obtained from Mark Wainberg (McGill AIDS Center, Montreal,\nCanada). The NRTI-resistant virus RT-M184V and nonnucleoside RT\ninhibitor (NNRTI)-resistant viruses RT-K103N and RT-Y181C were\nconstructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The NRTI-resistant virus\nRT-6TAMs (containing the six thymidine analog mutations M41L, D67N,\nK70R, L210W, T215Y, and K219Q, which confer resistance to thymidine\nanalogs) and the PI-resistant viruses PR-I84V/L90M and PR-G48V/V82A/L90M\nwere constructed by homologous recombination in electroporated SupT1\ncells.\n\n### Construction of infectious HIV-1 DNA clones with IN mutations.\n\nMutations conferring resistance to IN inhibitors were introduced into\nthe infectious wild-type HIV-1 DNA clone HXB2 by site-directed\nmutagenesis. Mutation(s) was confirmed by sequencing.\n\n### Expression and purification of HIV-1 IN.\n\nRecombinant IN containing an N-terminal six-His tag was expressed in\nBL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria. Bacteria were lysed with 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme and\nsonicated. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in lysis\nbuffer containing PIs (catalog no. P8849; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and\nDNase I (catalog no. 104132; Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and incubated for\n20 min on ice. Recombinant IN was solubilized by the addition of NaCl\nand CHAPS {3-\\[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio\\]-1-propanesulfonate}\nto final concentrations of 1.25 M and 10 mM, respectively. The slurry\nwas stirred gently on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 17,542 × *g* for\n30 min. The supernatant was saved, and an equal volume of adjustment\nbuffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl \\[pH 7.6\\], 12.5 mM MgCl ~2~ , 10 mM CHAPS, 40\nmM imidazole, 20% glycerol, 2.5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) was added. The\nsupernatant was loaded at 1 ml/min onto an Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid\ncolumn preequilibrated in column buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl \\[pH 7.6\\], 20 mM\nimidazole, 600 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl ~2~ , 10% glycerol, 10 mM CHAPS, 2 mM\nβ-mercaptoethanol). After washing the column, IN was eluted with\nimidazole, and fractions containing IN were pooled and dialyzed to\nremove imidazole. The purity of IN preparations was generally \\>95%.\n\n### IN strand transfer assay.\n\nThe IN strand transfer assay has been previously described ( 46 ).\nBriefly, biotinylated donor DNA was bound to streptavidin-coated plates.\nUnbound donor DNA was removed by washing, and IN was then added to each\nwell to allow 3′ processing of the donor DNA end for 30 min.\nDigoxigenin-tagged target DNA was next added to each well, and the\n3′-end-joining reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min. The wells\nwere washed to remove unjoined target DNA, and the chemiluminescence\nsignal was detected following addition of horseradish\nperoxidase-conjugated antidigoxigenin antibody. Test compounds were\nadded immediately before the target DNA.\n\n### Antiviral and cytotoxicity assays.\n\nFor the antiviral assay utilizing MT-2 and MT-4 cells, 50 μl of 2× test\nconcentration of the fivefold serially diluted compound in culture\nmedium with 10% FBS was added to each well of a 96-well plate (nine\nconcentrations) in triplicate. MT-2 and MT-4 cells were infected with\nHIV-1 IIIb at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 for 3 h. Fifty\nmicroliters of infected cell suspension in culture medium with 10% FBS\n(∼1.5 × 10 ^4^ cells) was then added to each well containing 50 μl of\ndiluted compound. The plates were then incubated at 37°C for 5 days.\nAfter 5 days of incubation, 100 μl of CellTiter-Glo reagent (catalog no.\nG7571; Promega Biosciences, Inc., Madison, WI) was added to each well\ncontaining MT-2 or MT-4 cells. Cell lysis was carried out by incubation\nat room temperature for 10 min, and chemiluminescence was read. For\ncompound cytotoxicity assessment, the protocol was identical except that\nuninfected cells were used and compounds were serially diluted\nthreefold.\n\nFor the antiviral assay utilizing phytohemagglutinin P and\ninterleukin-2-stimulated T cells, the cells were infected in bulk\nculture with HIV-1 BaL at an MOI of ∼0.001 for 3 h. After removal of\nunadsorbed virus, the cells were plated at 200,000 cells/well in a\n96-well plate containing serially diluted compounds. After 5 days of\nincubation at 37°C, the supernatant was collected, and HIV-1 yield was\nquantified by p24 antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\n(Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). To determine cytotoxicity, compounds\nwere incubated with uninfected cells for 5 days, and cytopathic effect\nwas measured by addition of the XTT reagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).\n\nTo study the effect of serum proteins on the antiviral activity of IN\ninhibitors, compounds were tested in the presence of either 35 mg/ml\nhuman serum albumin (HSA) (catalog no. A-1653; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or\n1.5 mg/ml α ~1~ -acid glycoprotein (α ~1~ -AGP) (catalog no. G-9885,\nSigma, St. Louis, MO). To assess the effect of human serum on compound\npotency, the assay was performed in the presence of 10%, 20%, 35%, and\n50% human serum from clotted whole blood (catalog no. 14-498E; Cambrex\nBio Science, Walkersville, MD) at the following three different MOIs:\n0.01, 0.02, and 0.04. The serum-adjusted 50% effective concentration (EC\n~50~ ) versus the fractional serum concentration plot was analyzed by\ncurve fitting using the following equation:\n\nwhere *f* is the fractional concentration of serum used; *S* is the\nprotein concentration in 100% serum (pg/μl); *M* is the mean molecular\nmass of a serum protein (pg/pmol); *n* is the Hill coefficient, a lower\nestimate for the average number of binding sites for the inhibitor per\nprotein molecule; EC ~50~ is the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC ~50~ )\nin the absence of serum (μM); EC ~50x~ is the IC ~50~ in the presence of\nserum (μM); *K ~D~* is the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of\nthe inhibitor from the mean binding site (μM); and *m* is the relative\nMOI, where *m* = 1 represents an MOI of 0.01. See the derivation of this\nequation in the supplemental material.\n\n### Drug combination studies.\n\nThe effect of combining any two drugs in the MT-2 antiviral assay was\nanalyzed by two different methods, the Prichard and Shipman method using\nMacSynergy II software ( 38 ) and the combination index (CI) method ( 6\n) using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO). MacSynergy II and\nCalcuSyn provide certain guidelines for the interpretation of the drug\ncombination results, as shown in Fig. ​ Fig.1 1 .\n\nFIG. 1.\n\nInterpretation of difference volumes and CI. The ranges of values that\nare equivalent between the two methods (MacSynergy II and CalcuSyn) are\nshaded similarly.\n\n### 2-LTR circle accumulation assay.\n\nThe assay for two-long terminal repeat (2-LTR) circle accumulation was\nadapted from a previously described method ( 3 ). SupT1 cells were\ninfected in bulk culture with HIV-1 IIIb at an MOI of 10 and at a cell\ndensity of 4 × 10 ^6^ cells/ml for 3 h at 37°C. Both the 2-LTR junction\n(2-LTR circles) and the host globin gene (used to normalize for cell\nnumber) were quantified using TaqMan real-time PCR. The copy number of\n2-LTR circles was normalized to that of the globin gene and plotted\nagainst drug concentration for EC ~50~ determination.\n\n### Alu-PCR assays.\n\nThe Alu-PCR assay has been previously described ( 3 ). SupT1 cells were\ninfected as a bulk culture with pseudotyped HIV-1 vector particles\nproduced from the SODk1 2G cell line ( 3 , 26 ) at an MOI of 10 and a\ncell density of 4 × 10 ^6^ cells/ml for 3 h at 37°C. The plates were\nincubated at 37°C for 12 h for late RT product quantification and for 48\nh for Alu-PCR product quantification. The levels of the late RT\nsequences and integration junctions quantified at 12 and 48 h\npostinfection, respectively, were normalized to the level of globin gene\npresent in the sample at these time points. Quantification by PCR was\nperformed by the ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied\nBiosystems, Foster City, CA).\n\n### Viral resistance selections.\n\nResistance selections were carried out in 6-well tissue culture plates.\nMT-2 cells were seeded at a density of 0.5 × 10 ^6^ cells per well in 5\nml of culture medium. Compounds were added at final concentrations\ncorresponding to their antiviral EC ~50~ or twice the EC ~50~ . HIV-1\nIIIb was used at an MOI of ∼0.01. The cultures were incubated at 37°C\nand split one-half to one-third once or twice a week depending on the\ngrowth status of the cells. The cytopathic effect manifested as\nsyncytium formation was used to follow the progression of infections.\nVirus was harvested and transferred to fresh MT-2 cells in the presence\nof the same compound but at a twofold-higher concentration. Successive\nviral passages were obtained by repeating this procedure. The duration\nof each passage ranged from 10 to 15 days.\n\n### Clonal sequencing of viral DNA.\n\nFor clonal sequencing of viral passages, total DNA was extracted from\ninfected cells using the QIAamp DNA blood minikit (Qiagen, Valencia,\nCA). A 2,765-bp viral DNA fragment spanning from nucleotide 372 of the\nRT gene to nucleotide 127 of the Vpr gene was amplified by PCR and\ncloned into the pCR-XLTopo plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The IN\ngene from 24 individual plasmid clones was sequenced using the BigDye\nterminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,\nCA). Sequencing reactions were analyzed by the ABI Prism 3100 genetic\nanalyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### GS-9160 inhibits HIV-1 IN function.\n\nThe inhibitory activity of GS-9160 was evaluated in a biochemical assay\nthat measures the capacity of IN to mediate strand transfer of viral\ndonor DNA into host or target DNA. GS-9160 produced inhibitory activity\n(IC ~50~ = 28 nM) that was comparable to those of L-870,810 (IC ~50~ =\n40 nM), elvitegravir (GS-9137) (IC ~50~ = 44 nM), and raltegravir\n(MK-0518) (IC ~50~ = 34 nM). These latter three HIV-1 IN strand transfer\ninhibitors were demonstrated to be efficacious in HIV-1-infected\nindividuals ( 10 , 13 , 18 , 29 , 31 ) (Table ​ (Table1 1 ).\n\n\n### GS-9160 has potent antiviral activity.\n\nThe antiviral activity of GS-9160 was evaluated in HIV-1-infected MT-2\nand MT-4 cell lines as well as in primary human T lymphocytes (Table ​\n(Table2). 2 ). The potency of GS-9160 was comparable in all three cell\ntypes, with an EC ~50~ range of 0.7 to 2 nM, and the selectivity indices\n(SI; 50% cytotoxic concentration \\[CC ~50~ \\]/EC ~50~ ) for GS-9160 were\n∼2,000 in MT-2 cells and ∼2,600 in primary human T cells. The potency of\nGS-9160 was generally comparable to those of L-870,810 and MK-0518 but\nwas lower than that of GS-9137 in these three cell types.\n\n\nTo assess the impact of human serum protein binding on the antiviral\npotency of GS-9160 and to provide a target trough concentration that\nwould need to be attained in humans to achieve efficacy, the antiviral\nactivity of GS-9160 was determined in the presence of human serum and\nthe human serum components HSA and α ~1~ -AGP (Table ​ (Table2). 2 ). The\nEC ~50~ of GS-9160 in 100% human serum was extrapolated from the EC ~50~\ns determined in the presence of 10, 20, 35, and 50% human serum. The\ncombined effect of both serum proteins, HSA and α ~1~ -AGP, increased\nthe EC ~50~ of GS-9160 by 7.1-fold to 15 nM in MT-2 cells, while the EC\n~50~ s of L-870,810, MK-0518, and GS-9137 were increased by 22-, 6-, and\n40-fold, respectively. Whole human serum had an effect similar to that\nof the combined serum proteins in MT-2 cells and increased the EC ~50~\nof GS-9160 by sixfold to 12 nM (Fig. ​ (Fig.2 2 and Table ​ Table2). 2 ).\nIn primary human T cells, the combined effect of HSA and α ~1~ -AGP\nincreased the EC ~50~ of GS-9160 by 10-fold to 15 nM, while the EC ~50~\ns of L-870,810 and GS-9137 were increased by 20- and 80-fold,\nrespectively. Therefore, we conclude that both L-870,810 and GS-9137\ndisplay higher levels of binding to human serum proteins than those of\nGS-9160 and MK-0518.\n\nFIG. 2.\n\nExtrapolation of antiviral EC ~50~ to 100% human serum. For each\ncompound, the EC ~50~ was determined at 10%, 20%, 35%, and 50% human\nserum using the following three different MOIs: 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04;\n0.01 is the standard MOI for antiviral assays. The serum-adjusted EC\n~50~ versus the fractional serum concentration plot was analyzed by\ncurve fitting using the equation in Materials and Methods to extrapolate\nthe EC ~50~ in 100% human serum. The error bars represent the standard\ndeviation of the mean EC ~50~ from at least two separate determinations\nin triplicate.\n\n### GS-9160 is an authentic inhibitor of HIV-1 integration.\n\nTwo assays were used to verify that the mechanism of action for GS-9160\nis inhibition of HIV-1 viral DNA integration in cells. Circular HIV-1\nDNA species containing 1-LTR or 2-LTR circles accumulate when viral\nintegration fails. Thus, an elevation in the levels of these viral\nnucleic acid species following treatment of infected cells with a small\nmolecule can provide key evidence that HIV-1 integration has been\ninhibited ( 2 ). Treatment of HIV-1-infected SupT1 cells with GS-9160\ncaused an approximate twofold increase in 2-LTR circles (Table ​\n(Table3). 3 ). Similar results were obtained with the clinically\nvalidated IN strand transfer inhibitors L-870,810 and GS-9137. This\nresult provided initial evidence that GS-9160 can block HIV-1\nintegration in a cell.\n\nAnother method to assess whether HIV-1 integration is impeded in\ninfected cells is by the direct measurement of integration junctions in\nthe host cell DNA ( 3 ). Detection by PCR of nucleic acid products\ncontaining Alu repeat sequences and portions of HIV-1 DNA represents\nevidence of successful HIV-1 integration. These products typically peak\nat 48 h postinfection. In the presence of GS-9160, these products\ndecreased in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC ~50~ of 0.9 nM, which\nwas a potency comparable to those observed with GS-9137 and L-870,810 in\nthis assay (Table ​ (Table3). 3 ). To ensure that this reduced\nintegration was not attributable to an impairment of the upstream\nprocess of reverse transcription, accumulation of late RT products was\nassessed in the presence of GS-9160. GS-9160, like the other two strand\ntransfer inhibitors, GS-9137 and L-870,810, did not affect the\naccumulation of late reverse transcription products, which was in sharp\ncontrast to the inhibitory effect noted with the NNRTI EFV (Table ​\n(Table3). 3 ). This result provides further evidence that GS-9160 is an\nauthentic inhibitor of integration in HIV-1-infected cells.\n\n### GS-9160 is synergistic in combination with approved HIV-1 antiviral drugs.\n\nTo determine the effect of combining GS-9160 with clinically approved\nHIV-1 antiviral drugs on antiviral activity, GS-9160 was tested in\npairwise combinations with a panel of drugs composed of NRTIs, NNRTIs,\nand PIs. Specifically, the antiviral activity of GS-9160 was evaluated\nin combination with eight approved HIV-1 antiviral drugs, the PIs LPV,\natazanavir, and nelfinavir; the NNRTI EFV; the nucleotide reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitor TDF; and the NRTIs AZT, FTC, and 3TC in\nHIV-1-infected MT-2 cells. The effect of combining any two drugs was\nanalyzed by two different methods, the Prichard and Shipman method using\nMacSynergy II software ( 37 , 38 ) and the CI method using CalcuSyn\nsoftware ( 5 , 6 ).\n\nUsing MacSynergy II, the results of the combination studies were\nexpressed as the mean synergy/antagonism volumes (nM ^2^ ·%) calculated\nat the 95% confidence level from at least two separate experiments\nperformed in triplicate. With CalcuSyn, the results of the combination\nstudies were expressed as the mean CI of at least two separate\nexperiments performed in triplicate. The two analytical methods gave\nsimilar results for all combinations tested, and results were consistent\nwith previous drug-drug interaction studies ( 12 ). Three pairs of\ndrugs, EFV+TDF, TDF+FTC, and AZT+3TC, served as examples of synergistic\ncombinations (Table ​ (Table4). 4 ). The RBV+d4T combination was tested\nto ensure that antagonism can be identified ( 30 ). In this particular\ncase, antagonism results from RBV-mediated inhibition of the\nphosphorylation of d4T ( 1 ). The AZT+d4T combination was tested as an\nexample of a suboptimal pair of drugs, since clinically, the combination\nof AZT+d4T results in antagonism due to the effective competition of\nAZT-monophosphate for thymidine kinase, which is also necessary for the\nphosphorylation of d4T. However, with in vitro studies, evidence of\nantagonism between d4T and AZT has been inconsistent ( 12 ). GS-9160 was\nsynergistic when tested in combination with all eight of these\nclinically approved HIV-1 antiviral drugs (Table ​ (Table4 4 ).\n\n### GS-9160 is active against drug-resistant mutants of HIV-1.\n\nThe antiviral activity (EC ~50~ ) of GS-9160 was determined against a\npanel of drug-resistant mutants of HIV-1. The panel included mutants\nthat were resistant to the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor\nTDF (K65R), the NRTI FTC (M184V), and thymidine analogs. The panel also\nincluded viral mutants that were resistant to the NNRTI (K103N and\nY181C) and PI (I84V/L90M and G48V/V82A/L90M) classes of drugs. The\nresistance profile of GS-9160 was compared to those of the two other IN\ninhibitors, L-870,810 and GS-9137 (Table ​ (Table5). 5 ). GS-9160, like\nL-870,810 and GS-9137, retained activity against NRTI-, NNRTI-, and\nPI-resistant HIV-1 mutants. The antiviral activity of GS-9160 against\nthese drug-resistant mutants was comparable to its activity against the\nwild-type reference virus HIV-1 IIIb (Table ​ (Table5 5 ).\n\n### Phenotypic resistance to GS-9160.\n\nViral resistance selections with GS-9160 were performed in tissue\nculture to identify mutations that diminish susceptibility to the\nantiviral effects of GS-9160. Parallel resistance selections were\nperformed with several known anti-HIV-1 drugs (3TC, EFV, APV) (Table ​\n(Table6). 6 ). The change in antiviral EC ~50~ s for the drug-selected\nviral pools compared to wild-type EC ~50~ served as an indication of the\nenrichment of drug-resistant strains in the viral pool. For 3TC,\nphenotypic resistance was \\>272-fold at day 33 of selection, while\nphenotypic resistance to EFV was 35-fold at a comparable time of 31 days\nand reached 281-fold 43 days later. APV resistance selections yielded\n8.7-fold resistance at day 48. Selection with GS-9160 led to the\nemergence of a virus pool showing 4.3-fold resistance by passage 5 and\n51-fold resistance by passage 9 (Table ​ (Table6). 6 ). Phenotypic\nresistance to GS-9160 developed in a time frame comparable to that of\nthe development of phenotypic resistance to APV. The viruses selected\nwith GS-9160 displayed levels of cross-resistance similar to those of\nL-870,810 and MK-0158 but higher levels of resistance to GS-9137 at\nevery passage (passage 5 to 9).\n\n\n### GS-9160 selected a novel pattern of IN inhibitor resistance mutations.\n\nClonal sequencing of GS-9160-selected viruses from passages 5, 6, 8, and\n9 revealed the successive emergence of mutations E92V and L74M in the\ncatalytic core domain of HIV-1 IN (Table ​ (Table7). 7 ). Mutation E92V\nemerged first at passage 5, followed by the emergence of L74M at passage\n6. Both E92V and L74M were present in 100% of the clones sequenced at\npassage 6 and were maintained through passage 9. Since the level of\nresistance progressively increased from 26-fold to ∼51-fold between\npassages 6 and 9, additional mutations could have emerged in other HIV-1\ngenes to further increase the resistance level. To determine whether IN\nmutations E92V and L74M can recapitulate resistance to GS-9160, these\nmutations were introduced either individually or together into an\ninfectious molecular clone of HIV-1. Interestingly, E92V alone confers\n12-fold resistance to GS-9160, but L74M alone had no effect (Table ​\n(Table8). 8 ). However, when combined, these mutations conferred 67-fold\nresistance to GS-9160, suggesting that L74M may potentiate resistance to\nGS-9160 conferred by E92V. E92V displayed cross-resistance to GS-9137\n(44-fold), L-870,810 (8-fold), and MK-0518 (6-fold), while L74M had no\neffect on the potency of these IN inhibitors (Table ​ (Table8). 8 ). The\ndouble mutant E92V/L74M was also cross resistant to GS-9137, L-870,810,\nand MK-0518. Thus, the IN mutation L74M acted as a potentiator of E92V\nresistance against L-870,810, MK-0518, and GS-9137 (Table ​ (Table8). 8\n). It is noteworthy that L74M has been selected previously using other\nIN inhibitors such as L-708,906, a diketo acid ( 16 ); S-1360, a diketo\ntriazole ( 15 ); and L-870,810, a naphthyridine analog ( 22 ). In each\ncase, L74M as a single mutant showed no more than ∼1.7-fold resistance\nagainst various IN inhibitors tested.\n\n### Activity of GS-9160 against mutations conferring resistance to other IN inhibitors.\n\nSeveral other IN strand transfer inhibitors have been used to select for\nviral resistance in tissue culture. For instance, mutation T66I was\npreviously selected with the diketo acid IN inhibitor L-708,906 ( 16 ,\n19 ), with S-1360, a diketo triazole IN inhibitor ( 15 , 45 ), and with\nGS-9137 ( 25 ). The mutation E92Q was selected by GS-9137 and L-870,810\n( 22 , 28 , 39 ), and E138K was selected with S-1360 ( 15 ). The\nmutation Q148K was selected by S-1360 ( 45 ) and MK-0518 ( 43 , 44 ).\nThe mutation G140S was selected by l -chicoric acid ( 27 ), and N155S\nwas selected by S-1360 ( 45 ). The mutation V151A was selected with\nGS-278012, a prototype tricyclic compound and an analog of GS-9160 (data\nnot shown). Mutation N155H developed in simian-human immunodeficiency\nvirus SHIV-89.6P-infected rhesus macaques treated with L-870,812, an\nanalog of L-870,810 ( 21 ). Several of these mutations, including L74M,\nE92Q, E138K, G140S, Q148K, and N155H, also developed in HIV-1-infected\npatients that were administered MK-0518 ( 7 , 20 , 40 ), and T66I, E92Q,\nE138K, G140S, and N155H were identified in patients receiving GS-9137 (\n33 ).\n\nThese various IN inhibitor-selected mutations were introduced into a\nwild-type HIV-1 infectious molecular clone to determine if they are\ncross resistant to GS-9160 (Table ​ (Table8). 8 ). The T66I mutant virus\nshowed no cross-resistance against L-870,810, MK-0518, and GS-9160 but\ndisplayed 28-fold resistance against GS-9137. E92Q displayed comparable\nresistance to GS-9160 and L-870,810 (∼30- to 40-fold), 153-fold\nresistance to GS-9137, and 7-fold resistance to MK-0518. Similarly,\nQ148K and N155H conferred a comparable degree of resistance to GS-9160\n(23- and 50-fold, respectively) and L-870,810 (35- and 65-fold,\nrespectively) and higher resistance to GS-9137 (600- and 100-fold,\nrespectively). N155S also displays comparable levels of resistance,\nalbeit lower than N155H, to GS-9160 (12-fold) and L-870,810 (21-fold)\nand higher levels of resistance to GS-9137 (133-fold). In summary, IN\nmutations E92Q, Q148K, N155H, and N155S appear to be cross resistant to\nthe four IN inhibitors, GS-9160, L-870,810, MK-0518, and GS-9137.\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nIn this report, we describe the biological characterization of GS-9160,\nan antiviral inhibitor of the HIV-1 IN strand transfer reaction. GS-9160\nis a prototype from a novel structural class, the *N*\n-benzyl-pyrrolidinone-hydroxyquinoline, which has potent antiviral\nactivity in both T-lymphoblastoid cell lines and primary human T\nlymphocytes. GS-9160 is an authentic inhibitor of HIV-1 integration in\ntissue culture as measured by both an elevation of 2-LTR circles and a\ndecrease of integration junctions in HIV-1-infected cells. GS-9160\nremained active against various NRTI-, NNRTI-, and PI-resistant HIV-1\nmutants and was synergistic with various clinically approved anti-HIV-1\ndrugs. Because the pharmacokinetics of GS-9160 in healthy human\nvolunteers revealed that once-daily dosing was unlikely, clinical\ndevelopment of this compound was discontinued.\n\nIt was previously reported that different resistance mutations emerged\nin cell culture when virus selections were carried out with two\nstructurally distinct strand transfer inhibitors, the diketo acid\nL-841,411 and the naphthyridine carboxamide L-870,810. Only one mutation\nselected by the diketo acid (N155S) conferred cross-resistance to\nL-870,810 ( 18 ). In this report, we have performed viral resistance\nselections with the novel tricyclic IN strand transfer inhibitor GS-9160\nand discovered a distinct resistance pattern, E92V and L74M. These\nmutations confer cross-resistance to the structurally distinct strand\ntransfer inhibitors L-870,810 and GS-9137.\n\nThe E92V resistance mutation in the IN catalytic core has not been\npreviously selected with IN inhibitors. The second mutation selected by\nGS-9160, L74M, appeared later and appeared to potentiate resistance to\nGS-9160, as well as L-870,810, MK-0518, and GS-9137, by the primary\nmutation E92V. Although mutation of E92 has been previously observed\nwith in vitro selections using GS-9137 ( 28 , 39 ) and with patients\nexperiencing virological failure with MK-0518 ( 7 , 40 ), the mutation\nwas a conversion to glutamine. Resistance selections performed with\nGS-278012, a close analog of GS-9160, also yielded E92V (data not\nshown). Because E92V was selected with GS-9160 and GS-278012, both\ncontaining a tricyclic pharmacophore, and was never previously observed\nwith other IN inhibitors belonging to different chemical classes, it is\npossible that selection of E92V is specific to this novel tricyclic IN\ninhibitor. The other mutation selected by GS-9160, L74M, has been\npreviously observed in viral selections using other IN inhibitors, yet\ninterestingly, this mutation on its own does not confer resistance to IN\nstrand transfer inhibitors. A more-recent resistance selection using\nL-870,810 generated a resistance pattern in IN consisting of the\nmutations L74M, E92Q, and S230N ( 22 ). The emergence of mutations at\nL74 and E92 is consistent with our findings that phenotypically\nresistant virus pools selected with GS-9160 were cross resistant to\nL-870,810 and suggest that GS-9160 and L-870,810 may interact similarly\nwith the IN active site.\n\nWe have developed an active site model of HIV-1 IN with one 3′-processed\ndonor DNA end interacting with the active site and a tricyclic compound\nbound in an active site pocket formed by IN and the 3′-processed donor\nDNA end (Fig. ​ (Fig.3) 3 ) ( 4 ). This active site model features three\nsites of interaction with GS-9160, as follows: a hydrophobic pocket\naccommodating the benzyl group of the compound (site 1), a\nmetal-chelating site where a metal can interact with the carboxy and\nhydroxy groups of the compound (site 2), and a site interacting with the\nquinoline nitrogen through either a metal or a water molecule (site 3).\nQ148 and V151 are located in the benzyl binding pocket and in direct\ncontact with the benzyl group of the tricyclic scaffold (Fig. ​ (Fig.3).\n3 ). Our previous finding that mutagenesis of these two residues\ndecreased the susceptibility of IN to inhibitors with either a\ntricyclic, a quinolone carboxylate, or a naphthyridine carboxamide\npharmacophore ( 4 ) is consistent with Q148K and V151A mutant viruses\nbeing cross resistant to GS-9160, GS-9137, and L-870,810, respectively.\nIndividually, L74M, E138K, and G140S do not confer much resistance to\nGS-9160 but when combined with E92V, Q148K, and E92V/V151A,\nrespectively, they enhanced resistance to GS-9160 (Table ​ (Table8). 8 ).\nIn our model, L74, E138, and G140 are in the proximity of the bound\ncompound but do not make direct contact with the compound, suggesting\nthat the L74M, E138K, and G140S mutations may induce a slight\nconformational change in IN which, in itself, will not decrease\nsusceptibility but may magnify the resistance conferred by E92V, Q148K,\nand V151A. According to our model, the carboxylic side chain of residue\nE92 could interact with the quinoline nitrogen of GS-9160 through a\nwater molecule. The E92V mutation would eliminate this site 3\ninteraction and weaken the binding of GS-9160. In the case of the E92Q\nmutation, substitution of the carboxylic acid group by an amide group\ncould make hydrogen bonding less favorable with the water molecule\nbecause of the diminished hydrogen bonding flexibility of the amide\ngroup, which is planar.\n\nFIG. 3.\n\nLocations of resistance mutations in the IN catalytic core domain and a\npotential binding site for GS-9160. GS-9160 is illustrated in orange,\nand the IN catalytic triad residues are shown in red. Residues in IN\nmaking direct contact with GS-9160 are shown in green, while residues\nmaking indirect contact with GS-9160 are shown in blue. Metal ions are\nshown in magenta. GS-9160 is shown with the benzyl group on the right\npointing toward the benzyl binding pocket delimited by V151 and Q148 and\nwith the C5 sulfonamide group pointing toward the reader. A metal ion\n(1) interacts with N155 and stabilizes the 3′-processed end of donor DNA\n(not shown here). A metal ion (2) interacts with catalytic residue D116\nand the carbonyl and C9 hydroxyl of GS-9160. E92V and L74M were\nmutations selected after serial passages of HIV-1 in the presence of\nincreasing concentrations of GS-9160 and are shown to confer resistance\nto GS-9160.\n\nOur model suggests that a single binding mode would exist for most\ncurrent strand transfer inhibitors, including diketo acids, L-870,810,\nGS-9137, and GS-9160, with the benzyl groups shared by all these\ncompounds buried deep into a benzyl binding pocket ( 4 ). This binding\nmodel provides some insights into the mutations in the IN active site\nthat were selected by various compounds, including diketo acids or\ndiketo acid analogs and our tricyclic compound GS-9160. With a better\nunderstanding of how certain resistance mutations may weaken the\naffinity of IN inhibitors, the rational design of second generation IN\ninhibitors that retain activity against drug-resistant mutants may be\npossible.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 26149983\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is an investigational prodrug of the HIV-1 nucleotide reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NTRTI) tenofovir (TFV), with improved potency and drug delivery properties over the current prodrug, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). TAF is currently in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Phase 1 and 2 studies have shown that TAF was associated with increased peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) drug loading and increased suppression of HIV-1 replication compared to treatment with TDF. In this study, selection of in vitro resistance to both TAF and the parent compound, TFV, led to the emergence of HIV-1 with the K65R amino acid substitution in RT with 6.5-fold-reduced susceptibility to TAF. Although TAF is more potent than TFV in vitro, the antiviral susceptibilities to TAF and TFV of a large panel of nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant mutants were highly correlated (R2 = 0.97), indicating that the two compounds have virtually the same resistance profile when assessed as fold change from the wild type. TAF showed full antiviral activity in PBMCs against primary HIV-1 isolates with protease inhibitor, nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), or integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance but reduced activity against isolates with extensive NRTI resistance amino acid substitutions. However, the increased cell loading of TFV with TAF versus TDF observed in vivo suggests that TAF may retain activity against TDF-resistant mutant viruses.\nRationale: The paper describes the resistance selection experiments conducted with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and tenofovir (TFV).

The combination of E157Q and R263K increased dolutegravir resistance by 20- and 10-fold compared with the WT and R263K enzymes, respectively. We also investigated the effects of E157Q on IN DNA binding activity and susceptibility to a DNA binding inhibitor in tissue culture, in part because we recently identified Glu157 as a putative interaction domain with the HIV IN DNA binding inhibitor FZ41\nRationale: The paper includes data on the susceptibility of various HIV-1 mutants to different integrase inhibitors, including dolutegravir and raltegravir, indicating that in vitro drug susceptibility data was reported.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 26149983\nQuestion ID: 1\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\nEvidence: Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is an investigational prodrug of the HIV-1 nucleotide reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NtRTI) tenofovir (TFV), with improved potency and drug delivery properties over the current prodrug, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF).

The antiviral activity of inhibitors was determined in a cell-based HIV-1 replication assay in triplicate. Briefly, MT4-LTR-EGFP cells (400,000 cells/ml) were infected with HIV-1 (IIIB, HXB2D, selected viruses, or SDM strains; multiplicity of infection MOI = 0.0025) in the presence or absence of inhibitor.\nRationale: The paper focuses on in vitro resistance selections and experiments using HIV-1 strains, specifically HIV-1 IIIB and HXB2D, which are laboratory strains.

To delineate the effect of resistance mutations on viral susceptibility to integrase inhibitors, in vitro resistance selections with raltegravir and with MK-2048, an integrase inhibitor with a second-generation-like resistance profile, were performed. Mutation Q148R arose in four out of six raltegravir-selected resistant viruses. In addition, mutations Q148K and N155H were selected. In the same time frame, no mutations were selected with MK-2048. Q148H/K/R and N155H conferred resistance to raltegravir, but only minor changes in susceptibility to MK-2048. V54I, a previously unreported mutation, selected with raltegravir, was identified as a possible compensation mutation. Mechanisms by which N155H, Q148H/K/R, Y143R and E92Q confer resistance are proposed based on a structural model of integrase. These data improve the understanding of resistance against raltegravir and cross-resistance to MK-2048 and other integrase inhibitors, which will aid in the discovery of second-generation integrase inhibitors.\nRationale: The paper mentioned in vitro reistance selection, and all sequences were generated using site-directed mutation technology, which means the sequence were not from clinical samples.\nAnswer: Not reported"}

In addition,\nS/GSK1349572 demonstrates activity against clinically relevant IN mutant\nviruses and has potential for a high genetic barrier to resistance.\nS/GSK1349572 is a two-metal-binding HIV integrase strand transfer\ninhibitor whose mechanism of action was established through *in vitro*\nintegrase enzyme assays, resistance passage experiments, activity\nagainst viral strains resistant to other classes of anti-HIV agents, and\nmechanistic cellular assays. In a variety of cellular antiviral assays,\nS/GSK1349572 inhibited HIV replication with low-nanomolar or\nsubnanomolar potency and with a selectivity index of 9,400. The\nprotein-adjusted half-maximal effective concentration (PA-EC ~50~ )\nextrapolated to 100% human serum was 38 nM. When virus was passaged in\nthe presence of S/GSK1349572, highly resistant mutants were not\nselected, but mutations that effected a low fold change (FC) in the EC\n~50~ (up to 4.1 fold) were identified in the vicinity of the integrase\nactive site. S/GSK1349572 demonstrated activity against site-directed\nmolecular clones containing the raltegravir-resistant signature\nmutations Y143R, Q148K, N155H, and G140S/Q148H (FCs, 1.4, 1.1, 1.2, and\n2.6, respectively), while these mutants led to a high FC in the EC ~50~\nof raltegravir (11- to \\>130-fold). Either additive or synergistic\neffects were observed when S/GSK1349572 was tested in combination with\nrepresentative approved antiretroviral agents; no antagonistic effects\nwere seen. These findings demonstrate that S/GSK1349572 would be\nclassified as a next-generation drug in the integrase inhibitor class,\nwith a resistance profile markedly different from that of\nfirst-generation integrase inhibitors.\n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Compounds.\n\nS/GSK1349572 was synthesized at Shionogi Research Laboratories, Osaka,\nJapan. RAL and EVG were synthesized at GlaxoSmithKline, Research\nTriangle Park, NC. Efavirenz and lamivudine (3TC) were purchased from\nSequoia Research Products, Ltd., Pangbourne, United Kingdom. The\nstructures of S/GSK1349572, RAL, and EVG are shown in Fig. ​ Fig.1 1 .\n\nFIG. 1.\n\nChemical structures of the HIV-1 integrase inhibitors used in this\nstudy.\n\n### Cells and viruses.\n\nCells of MT-4, a human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-transformed\nhuman T-cell line, were maintained as described previously ( 12 ). 293T\ncells were maintained in Dulbecco\\'s modified Eagle medium (DMEM)-F-12\nmedium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Peripheral blood\nmononuclear cells (PBMCs) were derived from whole-blood samples obtained\nfrom HIV-negative donors. PBMCs were separated from whole blood by\ndensity gradient centrifugation with Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare,\nWaukesha, WI) according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions and were\nstimulated by the addition of either 20 U/ml of interleukin-2 (IL-2) or\n10% natural T-cell growth factor (ZeptoMetrix, Buffalo, NY) plus 5 to 10\nμg/ml of phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Molt-4 cells persistently infected\nwith HIV-1 IIIB and MT-2 cells ( 16 ) were obtained from S. Harada\n(Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan). HeLa-CD4 cells containing an\nHIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven β-galactosidase reporter gene\nhave been described previously ( 20 ). MAGI-CCR5 cells have been\ndescribed previously ( 9 ). HIV-1 strain IIIB was derived from cell-free\nsupernatants of cultures of the chronically infected cell line H93B\n(H9/HTLV-IIIB). HIV-1 strain Ba-L was purchased from Advanced\nBiotechnologies Inc. (Columbia, MD) and was expanded in PHA-activated\nPBMCs, while HIV-1 NL432 ( 1 ) was obtained from A. Adachi (Tokushima\nUniversity, Tokushima, Japan). Plasmid pGJ3-Luci, containing a\nreplication-defective HIV lentiviral vector expressing luciferase ( 21\n), was licensed from Christian Jassoy (University of Leipzig) and was\nused to create stocks of a vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G\n(VSV-G)-pseudotyped self-inactivating pseudo-HIV (PHIV) lentiviral\nvector by cotransfection along with plasmid pVSV-G (Clontech) into CIP4\ncells (a derivative of the 293T human renal epithelial cell line that\nexpresses macrophage scavenger receptor SRA-I to improve adherence to\nplastic) and harvesting of the cell-free supernatant.\n\n### *In vitro* strand transfer assay.\n\nThe inhibitory potencies of S/GSK1349572 and other INIs were measured in\na strand transfer assay using recombinant HIV integrase as previously\ndescribed ( 5 ). A complex of integrase and biotinylated preprocessed\ndonor DNA-streptavidin-coated Acintillation proximity assay (SPA) beads\nwas formed by incubating 2 μM purified recombinant integrase with 0.66\nμM biotinylated donor DNA-4 mg/ml streptavidin-coated SPA beads in 25 mM\nsodium morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) (pH 7.2), 23 mM NaCl, and\n10 mM MgCl ~2~ for 5 min at 37°C. These beads were spun down and\npreincubated with diluted INIs for 60 min at 37°C. Then a ^3^ H-labeled\ntarget DNA substrate was added to give a final concentration of 7 nM\nsubstrate, and the strand transfer reaction mixture was incubated at\n37°C for 25 to 45 min, which allowed for a linear increase in the strand\ntransfer of donor DNA to radiolabeled target DNA. The signal was read\nusing a Wallac MicroBeta scintillation plate reader.\n\n### Antiviral assay in MT-4 cells.\n\nMT-4 cells growing exponentially at a density of 5 × 10 ^5^ or 6 × 10\n^5^ /ml were infected with HIV-1 strain IIIB at a viral multiplicity of\ninfection of 0.001 or a 50% tissue culture infective dose of 4 to 10.\nThe cells were then aliquoted to 96-well plates in the presence of\nvarying concentrations of compounds. After incubation for 4 or 5 days,\nantiviral activity was determined by a cell viability assay that either\nmeasured bioluminescence with a CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent\n(Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) or measured absorbance at 560 and 690\nnm using the yellow tetrazolium MTT reagent\n\\[3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide\\].\n\n### Pseudo-HIV assay.\n\nThe antiviral activities of compounds were measured in a single-round\nassay using a self-inactivating PHIV lentiviral vector. CIP4 cells (2 ×\n10 ^4^ /well) infected with an amount of PHIV sufficient to produce\napproximately 50,000 relative light units were added to 96-well black,\nclear-bottom plates and were incubated for 2 days with S/GSK1349572 at\nvarying concentrations. Infected cells were measured as a function of\nluciferase activity in a luminometer using the Steady-Glo reagent\n(Promega Corporation).\n\n### Antiviral assay in PBMCs.\n\nIn one 96-well culture plate, PHA- and IL-2-stimulated PBMCs (4 × 10 ^5^\n/well) were preincubated with a compound for 1 h, while HIV-1 strain\nBa-L was mixed with the same compound in a second plate. An aliquot of\nthe Ba-L-compound mixture was then transferred to the PBMC-compound\nmixture and was incubated for 7 days. After this incubation,\nsupernatants were assayed for reverse transcriptase (RT) activity by\nincorporation of \\[ *methyl* - ^3^ H\\]dTTP to measure viral replication\nas previously described ( 15 ).\n\n### Effects of human serum and serum proteins.\n\nThe effect of the presence of human serum albumin (HSA; 20 or 40 mg/ml),\nα ~1~ -acid glycoprotein (AAG; 2 mg/ml), or human serum (HS; up to 30%\nor 50% was used, and results were extrapolated up to 100%) on the\nantiviral activity of S/GSK1349572 was evaluated in the PHIV and MT-4\nassay systems. To estimate the effects of the fold shift in protein\nbinding, antiviral activity was tested with the addition of various\nconcentrations of human serum to the HIV-1 IIIB replication assay\nmixture in MT-4 cells as previously described ( 15 ). The\nprotein-adjusted half-maximal effective concentration (PA-EC ~50~ ) was\nestimated by multiplying the EC ~50~ in PBMCs by the fold shift value.\n\n### Cytotoxicity assays.\n\n*In vitro* growth inhibition (cytotoxicity) studies were conducted with\nS/GSK1349572 in proliferating human leukemic and lymphomic cell lines\n(IM-9, U-937, MT-4, and Molt-4) as well as in stimulated and\nunstimulated human PBMCs. ATP levels were quantified by using the\nCellTiter-Glo luciferase reagent to measure the ability of a compound to\ninhibit cell growth as an indicator of the compound\\'s potential for\ncytotoxicity.\n\n### Mechanistic cellular studies.\n\nTo determine if S/GSK1349572 was inhibiting HIV replication in cellular\nassays through an integrase inhibition mechanism, the effects on the\nsynthesis of HIV NL432 DNA species in MT-4 cells were measured in a\nsingle-round infection assay using quantitative PCR methods.\nQuantitative PCR analysis was performed to measure the synthesis of HIV\nDNA species in MT-4 cells in the presence of an INI or NNRTI as\ndescribed previously, with minor modifications ( 15 ). Briefly, 293T\ncells were transfected with the NL432 plasmid to generate infectious\nvirus, and the supernatant was filtered through 0.45-μm-pore-size\nfilters and was treated with DNase I. MT-4 cells were infected with\nHIV-1 NL432 for 1 h, incubated with dilutions of a compound, and\ncollected after 6 or 18 h of incubation. All cells were incubated with\n0.5 μM ritonavir in order to limit HIV replication to a single cycle.\nTotal-DNA PCR to detect late RT products was performed by incubating the\nsamples for 6 h. Nested Alu-PCR to detect integrated provirus and 2-LTR\nPCR to detect 2-LTR circles were performed by incubating the samples for\n18 h. Reaction products were analyzed using the ABI Prism 7900HT-3\nsequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA).\n\n### Isolation of drug-resistant viruses.\n\nDrug-resistant viruses were isolated according to a previously described\nprotocol ( 24 ). Briefly, the virus used for initiating passage work was\nprepared by coculturing MT-2 cells with Molt-4 cells persistently\ninfected with HIV-1 strain IIIB for 3 days. Fresh MT-2 cells were\ndispensed into each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate. Three wells\nof each culture containing several concentrations of a compound were\nused initially, and the virus prepared as described above was added to\neach well. Every 3 or 4 days, the cells were passaged with or without\nthe addition of fresh MT-2 cells. When a cytopathic effect was observed,\nthe supernatants were used to infect fresh MT-2 cells, and the\nconcentration of the compound was held constant and/or increased 5-fold.\nEvery 2 weeks, when virus replication was ascertained by observation of\na cytopathic effect, the infected cells were collected and used for\ngenotypic and phenotypic analyses. For the analysis of mutations, DNA\nwas extracted from infected cells using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit\n(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and the integrase region of HIV proviral DNA\nwas amplified by PCR with specific primers (M-poli7,\nAACAAGTAGATAAATTAGTCAGT; M-poli8, TAGTGGGATGTGTACTTCTGAAC). The products\nwere sequenced by Operon Biotechnologies\\' sequencing service. The\nsequence of the integrase region derived from isolated viruses was\ncompared with that of wild-type IIIB, and amino acid substitutions were\nidentified.\n\n### Construction of integrase region-recombinant HIV-1 molecular clones.\n\nThe XbaI-EcoRI fragment from pNL-IN301 (the XbaI site was inserted into\nthe 5′ end of the integrase region of pNL432 \\[ 1 \\] and termed\npNL-IN301) was cloned into the XbaI-EcoRI site of cloning vector pUC18.\n*In vitro* mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed\nmutagenesis kit (Stratagene, a division of Agilent Technologies, Santa\nClara, CA) using pUC18 cloned with the integrase region as a template.\nThe mutated XbaI-EcoRI fragment was amplified and ligated into pNL-IN301\nto construct a recombinant HIV-1 molecular clone. Plasmids were\nsubsequently transfected into 293T cells to generate infectious virus.\nSupernatants were harvested after 2 days of culture and were stored as\ncell-free culture supernatants at −80°C.\n\n### Cross-resistance profiling of S/GSK1349572.\n\nS/GSK1349572 was evaluated against molecular clones with mutations in\nthe integrase-, RT-, and protease-coding regions. INI-, NRTI-, and\nNNRTI-resistant mutants were analyzed by the reporter assay based on\nHeLa-CD4 cells, while PI-resistant mutants were analyzed by infectivity\nin MT-4 cells, with monitoring of RT activity as described previously (\n15 ). The HIV-1 wild-type infectious molecular clone pNL432 was used for\nsite-directed mutagenesis to generate HIV clones containing mutations.\nFifty INI-resistant mutants were constructed. The molecular clones with\na K103N or Y188L mutation ( 2 , 3 ) within the RT-coding region were\nused as NNRTI-resistant viruses; those with M184V ( 6 , 40 ),\nD67N/K70R/T215Y ( 7 ), or R4 (V75I/F77L/F116Y/Q151M) ( 35 ) mutations\nwithin the RT coding region were used as NRTI-resistant viruses; and\nthose carrying M46I/I47V/I50V ( 36 ) or L24I/M46I/L63P/A71V/G73S/V82T (\n23 ) mutations in the protease-coding region were used as PI-resistant\nviruses. 293T cells were subsequently transfected with the plasmids to\ngenerate infectious virus using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen\nCorporation, Carlsbad, CA). Supernatants were harvested 2 to 3 days\nafter transfection, stored as cell-free culture supernatants at −80°C,\nand used for each assay.\n\n### Combination antiviral activity assay in MT-4 cells.\n\nThe *in vitro* combination activity relationships of S/GSK1349572 were\ndetermined as previously described ( 39 ). Multiple concentrations of\nS/GSK1349572 were tested in checkerboard dilution fashion in the\npresence and absence of dilutions of representative approved anti-HIV\ndrugs, adefovir, or ribavirin. The assay used HIV-1 IIIB-infected MT-4\ncells, and the interaction of compound combinations was analyzed by\ndosewise additivity-based calculations to quantify deviation from\ndosewise additivity at the 50% level. Wells containing the top\nconcentration of compounds by themselves were compared to wells with the\ntop concentration of compound combinations in order to show that\ncombination effects were due to the drugs used and not simply to\ntoxicity. Assays with the MT-4 system format were run as described\npreviously ( 15 ). Fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) values in\nthe range of −0.1 to −0.2 indicate weak synergy; values that approach\n−0.5 indicate strong synergy; and positive values of 0.1 to 0.2 indicate\nweak antagonism. The effects of the anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HBV)\nand anti-HCV agents adefovir and ribavirin on S/GSK1349572 IC50 were\nexamined using linear regression as described previously ( 41 ). Since\nthe HIV-1 IIIB MT-4 system is CXCR4 based, the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc\nwas evaluated in a checkerboard dilution format using MAGI-CCR5 cells\nwith the Gal Screen reagent (Tropix, Bedford, MA) for chemiluminescent\nendpoints, and data were analyzed as described by Prichard and Shipman (\n37 ) by using the MacSynergy II program. Synergy volumes in the range of\n−50 to 50 define additivity; \\<−50, antagonism; and \\>50, synergy.\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Inhibition of recombinant HIV integrase and HIV replication by S/GSK1349572.\n\nS/GSK1349572 inhibited HIV-1 integrase-catalyzed strand transfer with a\n50% inhibitory concentration (IC ~50~ ) of 2.7 nM. The EC ~50~ against\nHIV-1 was 0.51 nM in PBMCs, 0.71 nM in MT-4 cells, and 2.2 nM in the\nPHIV assay, which uses a pseudotyped self-inactivating virus.\nMeasurements of the fold shift from EC ~50~ to EC ~90~ ranged from\n3-fold to a maximum of 4-fold; as a conservative measure, an EC ~90~\n4-fold higher than the EC ~50~ was used. This low-nanomolar potency was\nsimilar to the potencies of RAL and EVG (Table ​ (Table1). 1 ). In the\nMT-4 antiviral assay, the estimated potency shift was 75-fold when the\nresults were extrapolated to 100% human serum and 32-fold in the\npresence of 20 mg/ml HSA. In the PHIV assay, the potency shift was\n11-fold with 40 mg/ml HSA and 2.1-fold in the presence of 2 mg/ml AAG.\nThe extrapolated potency shift of 75-fold for S/GSK1349572 in the\npresence of 100% human serum was also applied to EC ~50~ and EC ~90~ in\nPBMCs, resulting in PA-EC ~50~ and PA-EC ~90~ values of 38 nM and 152\nnM, respectively. These values were similar to those of EVG and 4.1-fold\nless potent than those of RAL.\n\nThe 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC ~50~ ) for S/GSK1349572 in\nproliferating IM-9, U-937, MT-4, and Molt-4 cells were 4.8, 7.0, 14, and\n15 μM, respectively. In unstimulated and stimulated PBMCs (both from the\nsame 4 donors), the CC ~50~ were 189 μM and 52 μM, respectively. Based\non the EC ~50~ of S/GSK1349572 against HIV-1 in PBMCs (i.e., 0.51 nM),\nthis translates to a cell-based therapeutic index of at least 9,400.\n\n### Cellular mechanistic studies.\n\nAs shown in Fig. ​ Fig.2, 2 , S/GSK1349572 inhibited the integration of\nviral DNA (Fig. ​ (Fig.2b), 2b ), with a concomitant increase in 2-LTR\ncircles (Fig. ​ (Fig.2c) 2c ) and no effect on viral DNA production (Fig.\n​(Fig.2a). 2a ). Thus, S/GSK1349572 demonstrated the expected effects of\nan INI. Furthermore, the concentration dependency of the effects was\nwithin the range of error for the potency observed in the inhibition of\nviral replication in PBMCs and MT-4 cells ( 11 ). These effects were\nsimilar to the effects observed with RAL and S/GSK364735 in a previous\nstudy ( 15 ) and contrasted with the effects of the NNRTI efavirenz.\n\nFIG. 2.\n\nEffects of inhibitors on various forms of viral DNA in MT-4 cells. The\nINIs S/GSK1349572 and RAL and the NNRTI efavirenz were each tested\nseparately with MT-4 cells infected with HIV-1 NL432 in order to\ndetermine their effects on the amounts of total viral DNA (a),\nintegrated viral DNA (b), and 2-LTR circular viral DNA (c). The amount\nof DNA relative to that in the control is shown along the *y* axis of\neach graph. Each bar represents the mean value from three independent\nexperiments. Error bars represent standard deviations.\n\n### Cross-resistance profiling of S/GSK1349572.\n\nWhen tested against HIV strains resistant to marketed NNRTIs or NRTIs,\nS/GSK1349572 showed efficacy against five different NNRTI-resistant or\nNRTI-resistant viruses, with activity equivalent to that against\nwild-type virus (EC ~50~ , 1.3 to 2.1 nM). Likewise, S/GSK1349572 showed\nefficacy against two different PI-resistant viruses, with activity\nequivalent to that against wild-type virus (EC ~50~ , 0.36 and 0.37 nM).\n\n### Isolation of viruses resistant to S/GSK1349572 and other INIs.\n\n*In vitro* passage experiments were performed with S/GSK1349572 and RAL,\nwith the NRTI lamivudine as a reference, starting with wild-type HIV-1\nIIIB (Table ​ (Table2), 2 ), itself a quasispecies. In the culture with\nS/GSK1349572, the T124A substitution was observed first on day 14\n(notably, IIIB contains ∼40% T124A at baseline). The T124A/S153F\nsubstitution was observed on day 28, followed by the T124A/S153Y and\nL101I/T124A/S153F substitutions on day 70; these substitutions persisted\nthroughout the remaining passages. Viruses with the S153Y substitution\nwere isolated on days 84 and 112. Only four viruses with substitutions\nwere observed on day 112.\n\nMutations that reduced susceptibility more than 5-fold, as measured by\nphenotypic assays, are shown in boldface in Table ​ Table2. 2 . This\nlevel of resistance was observed on day 14 with lamivudine and on day 28\nwith RAL. Highly resistant mutants with a high fold change (FC)\n(\\>100-fold) in the EC ~50~ were isolated in the presence of RAL;\nviruses with many of these mutations have also been isolated in the\nclinic from patients failing RAL-based regimens ( 11 ). In contrast, no\nhighly resistant mutants were isolated in the presence of S/GSK1349572\nthrough day 112. Multiple substitutions in integrase observed during\nS/GSK1349572 passage conferred only a low FC (maximum, 4.1-fold). Since\nthese viruses had relatively low FCs and these substitutions remained\nunchanged from day 70 to day 112, they should not significantly affect\nresistance to S/GSK1349572.\n\nThe dose escalation patterns of S/GSK1349572, RAL, and EVG were also\ncompared (Fig. ​ (Fig.3); 3 ); the *in vitro* passage experiment with EVG\nhas been described previously ( 24 ). Each passage was started with\n0.26, 1.3, 6.4, and 32 nM each INI, and compound concentrations were\nincreased in a stepwise manner. Figure ​ Figure3 3 shows the dose\nescalation patterns, starting from 1.3 nM, that permitted viral\nreplication to continue. The concentration of RAL was increased to 160\nnM on day 35, followed by 800 nM on day 77. The concentration of EVG was\nincreased to 160 nM on day 56. In contrast, no replication was observed\nat S/GSK1349572 concentrations of 32 nM or greater throughout the\npassage experiment. Thus, the maximum concentration of S/GSK1349572\nallowing replication was 6.4 nM.\n\nFIG. 3.\n\nLong-term culture of infected MT-2 cells with escalating concentrations\nof INIs. MT-2 cells were infected with strain HIV-1 IIIB and were\npassaged twice weekly in the presence of RAL (open triangles), EVG (open\nsquares), or S/GSK1349572 (filled circles). The highest concentrations\nof INIs at which the virus could replicate in cultured wells are shown.\n\n### Sensitivities of drug-resistant molecular clones to INIs.\n\nA panel of 50 INI-resistant site-directed mutants was constructed and\ntested for susceptibility to S/GSK1349572 and other INIs (Table ​\n(Table3). 3 ). Most of these mutants were isolated during *in vitro*\npassage studies and/or clinical trials of RAL, while a few were derived\nfrom the literature. Efavirenz was used as a control, and the FC in its\nEC ~50~ against the INI-resistant mutants was as high as 2.9-fold.\nTherefore, the viruses for which the EC ~50~ was ≥3-fold that for the\nwild type were considered to be resistant in this study.\n\nAlthough substitutions involving S153 (i.e., S153F, S153Y, L101/IS153F,\nT124A/S153Y, and L101IT/124A/S153F) were isolated during the *in vitro*\nselection study with S/GSK1349572, these mutant viruses remained\nsusceptible to S/GSK1349572. L101I and T124A are polymorphic, and all\nINIs showed wild-type potency against these site-directed mutants.\nS/GSK1349572 showed a moderate reduction in potency (FC, \\<10-fold but\n\\>3-fold) against five mutant viruses (the I151L, T66K/L74M,\nE138K/Q148R, G140C/Q148R, and G140S/Q148R mutants), with FCs from 3.5-\nto 8.4-fold. Ten RAL- and seven EVG-resistant mutants had FCs within the\n3- to 10-fold range. However, except for one mutant (I151L), all of\nthese moderately RAL and EVG resistant mutants were susceptible to\nS/GSK1349572. Only two mutant viruses, the E138K/Q148K and Q148R/N155H\nmutants (the latter of which has not been demonstrated on the same\ngenome), were shown to lead to an FC of \\>10-fold for S/GSK1349572;\nthese mutants also shared a highly resistant phenotype against RAL (FCs,\n330- and \\>140-fold, respectively) and EVG (FCs, 371- and 390-fold,\nrespectively). In contrast, RAL and EVG showed FCs of \\>10-fold in their\nEC ~50~ s against 23 and 32 mutant viruses, respectively. Notably,\nS/GSK1349572 is potent against all single mutants examined in our panel.\nFurthermore, limited cross-resistance against RAL- and/or EVG-resistant\nviruses was observed; S/GSK1349572 was active against most INI-resistant\nviruses with double or more mutations, including clinical isolates from\npatients with RAL treatment failure ( 42 ).\n\n### Cellular combination studies.\n\nS/GSK1349572 was tested in combination studies with 8 HIV\nantiretrovirals representing each class approved at the time, as well as\nwith adefovir and ribavirin, which are likely to be coadministered to\nHIV patients coinfected with HBV or HCV (Table ​ (Table4). 4 ). No\nantagonism was observed with any combination, and no enhanced\ncytotoxicity was observed within the concentrations tested for antiviral\nactivity. As expected, S/GSK1349572 was additive with itself. In\ncombination with nucleoside RT inhibitors, S/GSK1349572 was synergistic\nwith stavudine and abacavir. In combination with nonnucleoside RT\ninhibitors, S/GSK1349572 was synergistic with efavirenz and nevirapine.\nAmong HIV protease inhibitors, S/GSK1349572 was synergistic with\nlopinavir and amprenavir. The activity of S/GSK1349572 was found to be\nsynergistic with the effects of the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide and was\nnot significantly affected by the presence of the hepatitis B drug\nadefovir or the hepatitis C drug ribavirin (data not shown). Finally,\nS/GSK1349572 was additive with the effects of maraviroc (data not\nshown).\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nIt is well accepted that HIV can overcome drug therapy through the\naccumulation of resistance mutations. Clinical data indicate that\nresistant viruses against the first-generation INI drugs (RAL and EVG)\nhave indeed arisen already ( 18 , 32 ). We have engineered a new INI,\nS/GSK1349572, that is highly active against both wild-type HIV and many\nINI-resistant mutants and that has the potential for a higher genetic\nbarrier to resistance. The EC ~50~ of S/GSK1349572 against HIV-1 in\nPBMCs and various other cells (data not shown) is in the low-nanomolar\nto subnanomolar range. In addition, the median EC ~50~ against nine\nclinical isolates of HIV-2 was 0.8 nM ( 10 ). Cellular toxicity was in\nthe micromolar range for a variety of cell types, indicating that the\nobserved antiviral effect of S/GSK1349572 was not due to cytotoxicity.\n\nBased on the data presented, the mechanism of inhibition is strongly\nsuggested to be at the strand transfer step of HIV integrase, thus\npreventing the insertion of viral DNA into host DNA. In addition,\nintegration reaction products obtained using blunt-end DNA as a\nsubstrate were resolved with a DNA sequencing gel, and S/GSK1349572\nshowed minor inhibition of 3′-end processing versus strand transfer\ninhibition (data not shown), indicating that S/GSK1349572 is a strand\ntransfer inhibitor. S/GSK1349572 inhibited both the HIV integration\nreaction strand transfer step *in vitro* and HIV replication in cells\nwith similar potencies. The inhibitor had no effect on total viral DNA\nsynthesis in infected cells but blocked the integration of viral DNA\ninto host DNA with the same potency as its antiviral effect. In\naddition, this INI increased the appearance of viral 2-LTR circles, a\npredicted by-product of integrase inhibition, with the same potency. The\ncompound had potency against mutant viruses resistant to NRTIs, NNRTIs,\nand PIs similar to its potency against the wild type and consistent with\naction on a different antiretroviral target. The passage of virus in an\nS/GSK1349572-containing medium selected for viruses with mutations in\nthe vicinity of the integrase active site, though the FCs in the EC ~50~\ns against the mutants were very low. Finally, S/GSK1349572 had decreased\npotency against a small subset of mutant viruses resistant to known\nINIs.\n\n*In vitro* passage with S/GSK1349572 followed a pathway significantly\ndifferent from that with RAL, ELV, or lamivudine. While viruses with the\nability to replicate at micromolar levels of RAL, ELV, or lamivudine\nwere readily selected, the concentration of S/GSK1349572 that allowed\nfor virus replication could not be raised above 32 nM. In addition, only\nfour substitutions or combinations of substitutions (T124A, S153Y,\nT124A/S153Y, and L101Y/T124A/S153Y) were observed on passage with\nS/GSK1349572 up to day 112, and these amino acid substitutions did not\ncause a high FC in susceptibility to S/GSK1349572 in the phenotype\nassay. Although amino acid position 153 is conserved, amino acid\npositions 101 and 124 in HIV-1 integrase are polymorphic ( 8 ). It was\nalso demonstrated that the selection of resistant mutations from a\nwild-type population was greatly delayed in S/GSK1349572-containing\nmedium in contrast with that for first-generation INIs. Taken together,\nthese results demonstrate that S/GSK1349572 possesses a resistance\nprofile distinct from that of the first-generation INIs and suggest that\nS/GSK1349572 may possess a higher genetic barrier to the development of\nresistance.\n\nThe substitutions observed in the passage study with S/GSK1349572 had no\neffect or minimal effects on susceptibility to S/GSK1349572 or other\nINIs when they were introduced into a laboratory strain by site-directed\nmutagenesis. Moreover, the substitutions described here have not been\nobserved so far in passage studies with other INIs, except for T124A,\nwhich is a polymorphism in the integrase region; viruses with T124A have\nbeen isolated with S-1360, S/GSK364735, RAL, L-870,810, and EVG ( 24 ).\nNotably, the passage with HIV-1 IIIB utilized a virus population derived\nfrom a chronically infected cell line, and at the initiation of passage,\nthe T124A variant was present as approximately 40% of the quasispecies\npopulation. The T124A substitution alone did not contribute to virus\nresistance and, like L101I, is a naturally occurring polymorphism ( 26\n).\n\nImportantly, S/GSK1349572 showed potency against all integrase-resistant\nsingle mutants in our panel at a level similar to that observed against\nwild-type virus or with an FC as high as 3.6-fold. This result may\npartially explain the observation during passage in the presence of\nS/GSK1349572 that no virus with high resistance to S/GSK1349572 was\nobserved with 32 nM or higher concentrations of S/GSK1349572 in the\nculture medium. The hypothesis would be as follows: more than one\nsubstitution is required for very high resistance, and if single\nmutations conferring significant resistance did not first arise, then\nvery high resistance would not occur during passage. In contrast, during\npassage with RAL and EVG (as well as with the control, lamivudine),\nsingle amino acid substitutions could cause a significant fold change;\nthen additional secondary mutations could provide increased resistance\nor compensate for the decreased fitness of the virus. Overall, these\ndata are also supportive of the potential for a higher genetic barrier\nof S/GSK1349572 to resistance, although clinical data will be required\nto fully test this hypothesis. It is noteworthy that in a 10-day phase\n2a monotherapy study, the plasma steady-state geometric mean\nconcentration at the end of a dosing interval ( *C* ~tau~ ) at\nonce-daily dosing with 50 mg was 0.83 μg/ml, 13 times the *in vitro*\nPA-EC ~90~ (S. Min et al., submitted for publication).\n\nIt is also striking that S/GSK1349572 had significant potency against\nmost double or more mutants in our panel, with the exception of the\nE138K/Q148K and Q148R/N155H mutants (FCs, 19 and 10, respectively).\nWhile these double mutants were highly resistant to S/GSK1349572, the\nfirst mutation of these pathways (i.e., Q148K, Q148R, or N155H) was not\nselected in the passage study with S/GSK1349572, perhaps because the FCs\nfor these single mutants remained similar to that for the wild type. The\nreplication/infectivity of the E138K/Q148K mutant was higher than that\nwith Q148K alone, but even so, its replication capacity and integration\nefficiency were poorer than those of the wild type ( 34 ). The Q148R and\nN155H mutations were not observed in the same genome in clinical\nisolates but were found as mixtures ( 28 ), and the replication capacity\nof the Q148R/N155H mutant molecular clone was poor in PBMCs (unpublished\ndata). It is thus noteworthy that S/GSK1349572 had limited\ncross-resistance to RAL- and EVG-resistant mutants, clearly\ndistinguishing S/GSK1349572 as a next-generation INI. To better\nunderstand the distinct resistance profile of S/GSK1349572 compared to\nthose of RAL and EVG, studies of docking into HIV-1 IN/Mg ^2+^ /DNA\nmodels are in progress.\n\nSince INIs will be used in combination regimens, it is important to\nevaluate the potential for synergy and antagonism. S/GSK1349572 was\ntested in combination assays with representatives of all approved\nclasses of HIV therapeutics, as well as with adefovir and ribavirin,\ndrugs likely to be coadministered to HIV patients coinfected with HBV or\nHCV. We used ribavirin and stavudine (d4T) in the study as positive\ncontrols for antagonism ( 19 ). Ribavirin has no anti-HIV activity\nitself, and when added to d4T, ribavirin led to a decrease in its\npotency, thus demonstrating antagonism. No antagonism or trend toward\nantagonism was observed when S/GSK1349572 was tested with any class of\nmarketed HIV drug, adefovir, or ribavirin. On the other hand, with\nseveral of the combinations, either statistically significant synergism\nor a trend toward synergism was seen. Similar data have been presented\nfor other INIs ( 27 ) and raise the possibility of highly potent\ncombinations in the clinic.\n\nIn conclusion, S/GSK1349572 has a resistance profile markedly distinct\nfrom those of RAL and ELV, and it demonstrates the potential for a\nhigher genetic barrier to resistance. These preclinical findings formed\npart of the rationale for the selection of S/GSK1349572 as a candidate\nfor clinical development, and they provide a strong foundation for its\nongoing clinical investigation.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 38206187\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"We measured the phenotypic susceptibility to doravirine in site-directed mutants containing V106I, V106A, V106M, or Y188L mutations in a subtype B (NL4-3) and CRF02_AG genetic background, and in a subset of recombinant viruses with clinically derived RT-RNAse H coding region harboring V106I and no other major NNRTI RAMs. The methodology has been previously described by Malet et al [11]. Briefly, RT mutants of HIV-1 were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quikchange II XL mutagenesis kit (Agilent) using specific primers introducing the expected mutations into plasmids pNL4-3, pHXB2, and pCRF02_AG. After mutagenesis, all constructs were sequenced to verify the presence of the mutations and the plasmids were prepared using the NucleoBond midi preparation kit (Macherey Nagel). Viral stocks were obtained by transfecting 293-T cells with the mutagenized HIV-1 molecular clones or the linearized pNL4-3ΔRT-RNAseH vector together with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicon including the corresponding RT-RNAseH coding region from each clinical sample, as previously described [12]. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the viral supernatants were recovered, quantified through the evaluation of the expression of β-galactosidase in TZM-bl cells, and frozen at −80°C.\n\nIn vitro susceptibility to doravirine was determined through a TZM-bl cell-based assay previously shown to correlate well with the reference phenotypic Phenosense Assay [13]. Briefly, 10 000 TZM-bl cells/well were infected with the wild-type NL4-3 strain or NNRTI-resistant viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05 in the presence of 5-fold dilutions of doravirine (MedChemExpress) ranging from 1 μM to 0.512 pM. After 48 hours, cells were treated with Glo-Lysis buffer (Promega) and the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay (Promega), then relative luminescence units were measured through the GloMax Discover instrument (Promega) and elaborated with GraphPad software to calculate 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) values. Fold-change (FC) values were calculated with respect to the IC50 value obtained with the NL4-3 wild-type strain.  Background\nLimited data are available regarding the susceptibility of the reverse transcriptase V106I polymorphism to doravirine.\n\n Methods\nDoravirine susceptibility was measured in site-directed mutants (SDMs) containing V106A, V106M, and Y188L mutations in subtype B (NL4-3, HXB2) and CRF02_AG background and in new recombinant viruses with RT harboring V106I from clinical isolates.\n\n Results\nThe V106I subtype B was detected in 1523 of 26 428 sequences, showing a 3.2% in B and 2.6% in non-B subtypes, and was higher in subtype F (8.1%) and D (14.3%). Fold-changes (FC) in susceptibility for SDMs were below doravirine biological cutoff (3.0) for V106I, but not for V106A, V106M, and Y188L. Clinically derived viruses tested included 22 B (median FC, 1.2; interquartile range [IQR], 0.9–1.6) and 28 non-B subtypes (median FC, 1.8; IQR, 0.9–3.0). Nine (18%) viruses showed FC values equal or higher than the doravirine biological FC cutoff.\"\nRationale: The paper  describes the methodology used to measure the phenotypic susceptibility of various HIV-1 mutants to doravirine. This includes creating site-directed mutants with specific mutations (V106I, V106A, V106M, Y188L) in different genetic backgrounds (subtype B NL4-3 and CRF02_AG), as well as using recombinant viruses from clinical samples. The susceptibility was assessed using a TZM-bl cell-based assay across a range of doravirine concentrations, and IC50 values (50% inhibition concentration) were calculated to determine the drug's effectiveness against these mutants.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 26149983\nQuestion ID: 1\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\nEvidence: Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is an investigational prodrug of the HIV-1 nucleotide reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NtRTI) tenofovir (TFV), with improved potency and drug delivery properties over the current prodrug, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). TAF is currently in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Phase 1 and 2 studies have shown that TAF was associated with increased peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) drug loading and increased suppression of HIV-1 replication compared to treatment with TDF. In this study, selection of in vitro resistance to both TAF and the parent compound, TFV, led to the emergence of HIV-1 with the K65R amino acid substitution in RT with 6.5-fold-reduced susceptibility to TAF. Although TAF is more potent than TFV in vitro, the antiviral susceptibilities to TAF and TFV of a large panel of nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant mutants were highly correlated (R2 = 0.97), indicating that the two compounds have virtually the same resistance profile when assessed as fold change from the wild type. TAF showed full antiviral activity in PBMCs against primary HIV-1 isolates with protease inhibitor, nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), or integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance but reduced activity against isolates with extensive NRTI resistance amino acid substitutions.

The number of clinical reports\ndemonstrating elevated numbers of K65R nevertheless suggests the\nexistence of factors limiting the increased incidence of K65R mutations.\nThus, we investigated the contributions of subtype C-specific silent\nnucleotide polymorphisms at thymidine analogue mutation (TAM) sites 70,\n210 and/or 219 that might reduce the previously described preferential\nselection of K65R in subtype C HIV-1 associated with subtype C-specific\nnucleotide polymorphisms at sites 64/65.\n\nMethods\n\nCell culture drug selections were performed with various drugs in MT2\ncells.\n\nResults\n\nThe use of nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors\n\\[N(t)RTIs\\] as single drugs or in combination confirmed the more\nfrequent selection of K65R by multiple N(t)RTIs in a subtype B virus\nthat contained the 64/65 nucleotide polymorphisms of subtype C than in a\nwild-type subtype B virus. This effect was attenuated in the presence of\nseveral silent TAM nucleotide polymorphisms, except when stavudine was\nemployed in the selection protocol.\n\nConclusions\n\nThese results further demonstrate that stavudine can preferentially\nselect for K65R in subtype C virus and also provide a basis for\nunderstanding the importance of silent nucleotide polymorphisms in\nregard to altered HIV drug resistance profiles.\n\nsubtype differences B/C , nucleotide polymorphisms , K65R resistance\nmutation , cell culture drug selections , N(t)RTIs , TAMs\n\n\n## Materials and methods\n\nProtocols similar to those previously described were employed. ^\\ \\ 6^\nThe following primers were purchased in desalted purity from Integrated\nDNA Technologies in order to generate all mutant NL4-3 plasmids---NL4-3\n(64/65) (forward): 5′-CTCCAGTATTTGCCATAAA **A** AA **G**\nAAAGACAGTACTAAATGGAG-3′; NL4-3 (64/65) (reverse):\n5′-CTCCATTTAGTACTGTCTTT **C** TT **T** TTTATGGCAAATACTGGAG-3′; NL4-3\n(70) (forward): 5′-GAAAGACAGTACTAA **G** TGGAGAAAATTAGTAGATTTCAG-3′;\nNL4-3 (70) (reverse): 5′-CTGAAATCTACTAATTTTCTCCA **C**\nTTAGTACTGTCTTTC-3′; NL4-3 (219) (forward): 5′-CCACACCAGACAA **G**\nAAACATCAGAAAGAACC-3′; NL4-3 (219) (reverse): 5′-GGTTCTTTCTGATGTTT **C**\nTTGTCTGGTGTGG-3′; NL4-3 (210) (forward): 5′-CTGAGACAACATCTGTT **A**\nAGGTGGGGATTTAC-3′; NL4-3 (210) (reverse): 5′-GTAAATCCCCACCT **T**\nAACAGATGTTGTCTCAG-3′.

Three TAM sites harbour\nsingle nucleotide polymorphisms at the third position of the codon, i.e.\nK70K, L210L and K219K, representing differences between subtypes B and C\n(Figure 1 a). At positions 70 and 219, the change is from A to G,\nwhereas a G to A switch occurs at position 210.\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\\(a\\) Location of the K65R mutation in HIV-1 subtype B and C sequences.\nRepresentation of the sites relevant to this study and the surrounding\nnucleotide sequences, and comparison of the subtype B and C consensus\nsequences.

These\nthree TAM polymorphism-containing viruses, i.e. NL4-3 (64/65/70), NL4-3\n(64/65/70/219) and NL4-3 (64/65/70/219/210), were compared with\nwild-type NL4-3 and NL4-3 (64/65) in cell culture drug selections with\nN(t)RTIs under single or combination drug pressure.\n\nBased on known TAM antagonisms toward K65R, ^\\ \\ 16--19^ all three\nviruses containing TAM polymorphisms were expected to show an attenuated\nfrequency of K65R selection compared with NL4-3 (64/65) and to behave in\nan manner more similar to that of wild-type virus, i.e. NL4-3 (wt). Such\na result would explain, at a nucleotide level, discrepancies between\nprevious cell culture results with NL4-3 (64/65) in which K65R had been\nselected at high frequency, ^\\ \\ 6^ compared with clinical data\navailable from patients infected with subtype C virus who often did not\npossess K65R at such a high incidence. ^\\ \\ 7--9^\n\nIn a first round of selections, we included tenofovir, didanosine,\nstavudine, apricitabine and abacavir as single drugs for 20 weeks or\nuntil a first resistance mutation had appeared (Figure 2 ). We did not\ninclude lamivudine, emtricitabine and zidovudine, since no\nsubtype-specific differences are expected with these drugs; i.e.\nlamivudine and emtricitabine preferentially select for M184I/V\nmutations, while zidovudine favours the development of TAMs, notably\nK70R. ^\\ \\ 6^ Selections with tenofovir resulted in the appearance of\nK65R in all viruses tested, whereas the four other drugs, i.e.\ndidanosine, stavudine, apricitabine and abacavir, failed to select for\nK65R with NL4-3 (wt) but did select for K65R when NL4-3 (64/65) was\nemployed, consistent with earlier results. ^\\ \\ 6^ In contrast, the\npreferential selection of K65R that was observed with NL4-3 (64/65) was\nattenuated in more than one-third of the TAM polymorphism-containing\nviruses that were exposed to didanosine, apricitabine or abacavir but\nnot to stavudine. Interestingly, none of the acquired resistance\nmutations were TAMs. These single drug selections demonstrate that\nsilent TAM nucleotide polymorphisms may be able to shift the resistance\nmutation selection pattern away from NL4-3 (64/65), which favours K65R.\n\nFigure 2.\n\nMutational preferences of wild-type and mutated NL4-3 viruses in MT2\ncells under single and combination drug pressure with N(t)RTIs. Viruses:\nwt denotes wild-type subtype B NL4-3 virus; 64/65, 64/65/70,\n64/65/70/219 and 64/65/70/210/219 denote subtype B NL4-3 viruses with\nsubtype C sequences at positions 64, 65, 70, 210 and/or 219.

All selections for resistance were performed at least three times.\nSelection of K65R is shown in bold.\n\nOpen in new tab Download slide\n\nIn drug combination selections, we subjected the same viruses to\ntenofovir/emtricitabine, tenofovir/lamivudine, stavudine/didanosine,\nabacavir/emtricitabine and abacavir/lamivudine for 20 weeks or until the\nfirst resistance mutation had appeared (Figure 2 ). As expected,\nabacavir/lamivudine selected for the M184I mutation in all cases, and no\nsubtype differences could be noted. ^\\ \\ 6^ The selection of K65R in the\ncase of NL4-3 (64/65) was attenuated in many of the TAM\npolymorphism-containing viruses that were exposed to\ntenofovir/emtricitabine, tenofovir/lamivudine or abacavir/emtricitabine.\nIn contrast, the combination of stavudine/didanosine continued to select\nfor K65R in all cases with the exception of subtype B virus, i.e. NL4-3\n(wt).\n\nThese results demonstrate that silent TAM nucleotide polymorphisms may\nbe able to diminish the likelihood of selection of K65R when various\nN(t)RTI combinations are studied, although not in the case of\nstavudine/didanosine.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nThese results show that silent nucleotide polymorphisms found at TAM\nsites can attenuate the tendency of viruses containing the 64/65 subtype\nC sequence to favour the K65R resistance mutation pathway. The\nrecombinant viruses that were tested developed K65R under drug pressure\nat high rates, but below the rates of viruses that did not contain\nsubtype C-specific TAM polymorphisms, as previously reported. ^\\ \\ 6^\nThese data are consistent with those that might be associated with K65R\ndevelopment in patients infected with subtype C HIV previously treated\nwith TAM-selecting drugs such as zidovudine. ^\\ \\ 7--9^\n\nIn contrast, the results obtained with stavudine indicated that K65R\nselection occurred in all circumstances tested, consistent with the\nresults of clinical studies in areas in which subtype C virus is\npandemic that have pointed to high rates of K65R in stavudine-treated\nindividuals. ^\\ \\ 7--9^ Other studies have shown that RNA template\nsequences that differ between subtype C viruses and those of other\nsubtypes are responsible for these differences in propensity for\nselection of K65R. None of the TAM polymorphism-containing viruses\ndeveloped TAMs in the absence of K65R but rather seemed to favour other\nmutations such as M184I. A possible explanation may lie in the known\nantagonism between K65R and TAMs, ^\\ \\ 16--19^ and ultrasensitive assays\nfor the detection of individual mutations that are present at levels\nbelow limits of detection may help to resolve this issue.\n\nIn summary, the data presented here help to explain the fact that\npatients who have been treated with zidovudine as part of first-line\nregimens in developing countries may possess TAMs that antagonize the\nlater development of K65R mutations following subsequent therapy.\n^\\ \\ 16--19^ Other nucleotide polymorphisms may, of course, also\nmilitate against the development of K65R, and this should be\ninvestigated.\n\n\n## Funding\n\nThis research was supported by grants from the Canadian Institutes of\nHealth Research.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 25385110\nQuestion ID: 13\nQuestion: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\nEvidence: In vitro resistance selection of subtype B virus (MT4-green fluorescent protein [GFP] cells), as well as subtype A and C viruses (MT4-GFP/CCR5 cells) was conducted with DOR, rilpivirine (RPV), and efavirine (EFV) under low-multiplicity-of-infection conditions in a 96-well format.

These two\nmutations can compensate for each other in regard to fitness deficits\nconferred by each mutation alone, raising the question of why E138K did\nnot arise spontaneously in the clinic following lamivudine (3TC) use,\nwhich also selects for the M184I/V mutations. In this context, we have\ninvestigated the role of a N348I connection domain mutation that is\nprevalent in treatment-experienced patients. N348I confers resistance to\nboth the NRTI zidovudine (ZDV) and the NNRTI nevirapine (NVP) and was\nalso found to be associated with M184V and to compensate for deficits\nassociated with the latter mutation. Now, we show that both N348I alone\nand N348I/M184V can prevent or delay the emergence of E138K under\npressure with RPV or a related NNRTI, termed etravirine (ETR). N348I\nalso enhanced levels of resistance conferred by E138K against RPV and\nETR by 2.2- and 2.3-fold, respectively. The presence of the N348I or\nM184V/N348I mutation decreased the replication capacity of E138K virus,\nand biochemical assays confirmed that N348I, in a background of E138K,\nimpaired RT catalytic efficiency and RNase H activity. These findings\nhelp to explain the low viral replication capacity of viruses containing\nthe E138K/N348I mutations and how N348I delayed or prevented the\nemergence of E138K in patients with M184V-containing viruses.\n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Chemicals, cells and nucleic acids.\n\nEtravirine (ETR) and rilpivirine (RPV) were gifts of Janssen\nPharmaceuticals (Titusville, NJ).\n\nCord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) were obtained through the\nDepartment of Obstetrics, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada. The\nHEK293T cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection\n(ATCC). The following reagents and cells were obtained through the NIH\nAIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program: the infectious molecular\nclone pNL4-3, from Malcolm Martin; the TZM-bl (JC53-bl) cell line, from\nJohn C. Kappes, Xiaoyun Wu, and Tranzyme Inc.; NVP; and EFV.\n\npNL4.3PFB plasmid DNA was a generous gift of Tomozumi Imamichi, National\nInstitutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.\n\nAn HIV-1 RNA template, ∼500 nucleotides (nt) in size and spanning the 5′\nuntranslated region (UTR) to the primer-binding site (PBS), was\ntranscribed *in vitro* from AccI-linearized pHIV-PBS DNA ( 54 ) by using\nan Ambion T7-MEGAshortscript kit (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada),\nas described previously ( 55 ). The oligonucleotides used in this study\nwere synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA)\nand purified by polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis. The sequences\nof DNA template D110 and primer D25 used for DNA-dependent DNA\npolymerase assay are as follows:\n5′-GAATTAGATCGATGGGAAAAAATTCGGTTAAGGCCAGGGGGAAAGAAAAAATATAAATTAAAACATATAGTATGGGCAAGCAGGGAGCTAGAACGATTCGCAGTTAATCC-3′\n(D110) and 5′-GGATTAACTGCGAATCGTTCTAGCT-3′ (D25). For 5′-end labeling of\noligonucleotides with \\[γ- ^32^ P\\]ATP, the Ambion KinaseMax kit was\nused, followed by purification through Ambion NucAway spin columns,\naccording to protocols provided by the supplier (Invitrogen, Burlington,\nON, Canada).\n\n### Site-directed mutagenesis and preparation of site-directed mutant HIV-1 ~NL4.3~ virus stocks.\n\nTo construct HIV-1 RT expression plasmids and recombinant HIV-1 ~NL4.3~\ninfectious clones harboring the desired mutations in the RT gene,\nsite-directed mutagenesis reactions were carried out by using a\nQuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla,\nCA). This work was performed with HIV-1 RT expression plasmid\npbRT6H-PROT DNA ( 55 ) and plasmid pNL4.3PFB DNA ( 56 ) to generate\nrecombinant RT enzymes and HIV-1 ~NL4.3~ viruses containing the desired\nRT mutations. DNA sequencing was performed to verify the absence of\nspurious mutations and the presence of any desired mutation in the RT\ncoding sequences. Recombinant HIV-1 wild-type (WT) and mutant viruses\nwere generated by transfection of the corresponding proviral plasmid\nDNAs into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,\nBurlington, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions.\nViral supernatants were harvested at 48 h posttransfection, centrifuged\nfor 5 min at 800 × *g* to remove cellular debris, filtered through a\n0.45-μm-pore-size filter, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C. Levels of p24\nin viral supernatants were measured by using a PerkinElmer HIV-1 p24\nantigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit according to\nmanufacturer\\'s instructions. Virion-associated RT activity was verified\nby an *in vitro* RT assay, as described previously ( 5 ).\n\n### Selection of HIV-1 mutants in cord blood mononuclear cells under drug selection pressure.\n\nCBMCs stimulated with phytohemagglutinin A (PHA) were cultured in RPMI\n1640 medium supplemented with 10% qualified fetal bovine serum (FBS), 20\nU of human interleukin-2 (IL-2)/ml, 5 μg of hydrocortisone/ml, 2 mM l\n-glutamine/ml, 100 U of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml.\nCells in 24-well tissue culture plates were infected with recombinant\nviral clones at a similar multiplicity of infection (MOI). Selection for\nviral resistance mutations was performed by using increasing\nconcentrations of RT inhibitors at starting concentrations below the 50%\neffective concentration (EC ~50~ ), as described previously ( 37 , 38 ,\n57 ). As controls, all viruses were simultaneously passaged without\ndrugs. Reverse transcriptase assays were performed, as described\npreviously, to monitor viral replication ( 37 , 38 , 58 , 59 ). Based on\nthe ratio of the RT value of control wells (100%) to those of wells\ncontaining drug at the previous round of replication, drug\nconcentrations were adjusted at subsequent passages. Briefly, if the\nvalue of the drug-treated well was between 50 and 100% of the control\nvalue, the drug concentration was raised by 2- to 2.5-fold; if this\nvalue was between 10% and 49% of the control value, the same\nconcentration was maintained; and if the value dropped to \\<10% of the\ncontrol value, drug pressure was released entirely, and the process of\nselection was reinitiated. Virus-containing culture media were harvested\nand kept at −80°C for subsequent genotypic analysis. Selections for\nresistance were performed over a period of 19 weeks.\n\n### Measurements of HIV-1 replication kinetics in CBMCs.\n\nCBMCs were isolated and cultured as previously described ( 57 ).\nRecombinant WT viruses and viruses containing the desired mutations were\nnormalized by p24 in order to minimize interinoculum effects, as\ndescribed previously ( 58 ). Briefly, 2 × 10 ^6^ CBMCs were infected\nwith viruses containing 8 × 10 ^6^ pg of p24 for 2 h, and the cells were\nwashed with medium, resuspended in 4 ml complete medium after\nsedimentation, and split into 2 wells for each sample of a 12-well\nplate. The replication kinetics of mutant and WT viral stocks were\nassessed on the basis of p24 levels in culture supernatants sampled at\nvariable time points postinfection, as measured by ELISA as described\nabove.\n\n### Measurements of HIV-1 replication capacity in TZM-bl cells.\n\nThe relative replicative capacities of the following recombinant WT\nHIV-1 ~NL4.3~ clones containing the E138K, E138K/N348I, and\nE138K/M184IV/N348I mutations were evaluated in a noncompetitive\ninfectivity assay using TZM-bl cells, as previously described ( 37 , 60\n). Twenty thousand cells per well were added in triplicate into a\n96-well culture plate in 100 μl Dulbecco\\'s modified Eagle\\'s medium\n(DMEM) (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) supplemented with 10% fetal\nbovine serum (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada), 1%\npenicillin-streptomycin, and 1% l -glutamine (Invitrogen, Burlington,\nON, Canada). Viral stocks for both wild-type and mutant viruses were\nnormalized by p24, and recombinant viruses were serially diluted 2-fold\nfrom viral stock suspensions. After 4 h, 50 μl of DMEM was removed from\nthe wells and replaced by 50 μl of virus dilution; a control well did\nnot contain virus. Virus and cells were cocultured for 48 h, after which\n100 μl of Bright-Glo reagent was added and luciferase activity was\nmeasured in a 1450 MicroBeta TriLux microplate scintillation and\nluminescence counter (PerkinElmer), as described above. The viral\nreplication level of each viral variant was expressed as a percentage of\nrelative light units (RLU) with reference to the WT virus.\n\n### Analysis of phenotypic drug susceptibility in TZM-bl cells.\n\nPhenotypic susceptibility analyses of RT inhibitors were performed with\nrecombinant HIV-1 ~NL4.3~ clones in a TZM-bl cell-based *in vitro*\nassay, as described previously ( 37 , 38 , 61 ). Briefly, RT inhibitors\nat variable concentrations were added to TZM-bl cells (10 ^4^\ncells/well) in 96-well plates grown in 100 μl supplemented medium.\nImmediately after drug addition, cells were infected with WT or mutant\nviruses. At 48 h postinfection, cells were rinsed with 100 μl\nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with 50 μl/well Promega cell\nlysis reagent (Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, ON, Canada). Cell lysates were\nthen transferred to a white, opaque 96-well plate (Corning, Tewksbury,\nMA). Promega luciferase assay reagent (Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, ON,\nCanada) was added to each well, and RLU/well were measured by using a\nPerkinElmer 1450 MicroBeta TriLux microplate scintillation and\nluminescence counter (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). The EC ~50~ was\ncalculated by using the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software, San\nDiego, CA).\n\n### Recombinant reverse transcriptase expression and purification.\n\nRecombinant RTs in heterodimeric form were expressed from plasmid\npbRT6H-PROT ( 55 ) and purified as described previously ( 62 , 63 ),\nwith minor modifications. In brief, RT expression in *Escherichia coli*\nM15(pREP4) (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) was induced with 1 mM\nisopropyl-β- d -thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at room temperature.\nPelleted bacteria were lysed under native conditions with BugBuster\nprotein extraction reagent containing Benzonase (Novagen, Madison, WI),\naccording to the manufacturer\\'s instructions. After clarification by\nhigh-speed centrifugation, the clear supernatant was subjected to the\nbatch method of Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) metal affinity\nchromatography (QIAexpressionist; Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada). All\nbuffers contained Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche,\nMississauga, ON, Canada). Hexahistidine-tagged RT was eluted by using an\nimidazole gradient. RT-containing fractions were pooled, passed through\nDEAE-Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Mississauga, ON, Canada), and further\npurified by using SP-Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Mississauga, ON, Canada).\nFractions containing purified RT were pooled, dialyzed against storage\nbuffer (50 mM Tris-HCl \\[pH 7.8\\], 50 mM NaCl, and 50% glycerol), and\nconcentrated to 4 to 8 mg/ml with Centricon Plus-20\n30-kDa-molecular-mass-cutoff filters (Millipore, Etobicoke, ON, Canada).\nAliquots of proteins were stored at −80°C. Protein concentration was\nmeasured by using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories,\nSaint-Laurent, QC, Canada), and the purity of the recombinant RT\npreparations was verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel\nelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of\neach recombinant RT preparation was evaluated as described previously (\n64 ), using various concentrations of RT and a synthetic homopolymeric\npoly(rA)/poly(dT) ~12--18~ template/primer (T/P) (Midland Certified\nReagent Company, Midland, TX).\n\n### Susceptibility of RT inhibitors tested by DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity using recombinant RT enzymes.\n\nSusceptibility to ETR and RPV was assayed by using recombinant RT\nenzymes and heterodimeric DNA template/primer pair D110/D25, and\nexperiments were performed as described previously ( 55 ). Briefly, RT\nreaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 6 mM MgCl ~2~ , 60\nmM KCl, dNTPs (5 μM each) with 2.5 μCi of \\[ ^3^ H\\]dTTP (70 to 80\nmCi/mmol), 30 nM heterogeneous HIV-1 DNA T/P pair D110/D25, the same\nactivity of RT enzymes, and variable amounts of RT inhibitors was\nincluded in 50-μl reaction volumes. In the reaction mixtures, the final\nconcentrations of ETR or RPV were 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.10, 0.30, 1.00, 3.00,\nand 10.00 μM. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 30 min,\nreactions were terminated by adding 0.2 ml of 10% cold trichloroacetic\nacid (TCA) and 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate to the mixtures, and the\nmixtures were incubated for at least 30 min on ice. The precipitated\nproducts were filtered through a 96-well MultiScreen HTS FC filter plate\n(Millipore) and sequentially washed with 200 μl of 10% TCA and 150 μl of\n95% ethanol. The radioactivity of incorporated products was analyzed by\nliquid scintillation spectrometry using a 1450 MicroBeta TriLux\nmicroplate scintillation and luminescence counter (PerkinElmer). The 50%\ninhibitory concentration (IC ~50~ ) of each RT inhibitor was determined\nby nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism5.01 software.\n\n### RT-catalyzed RNase H activity.\n\nRNase H activity was assayed by using a 41-mer 5′- ^32^ P-labeled\nheteropolymeric RNA template, kim40R, that was annealed to a\ncomplementary 32-nucleotide DNA oligomer, termed kim32D, at a 1:4 molar\nratio, as described previously ( 44 ). Reactions were conducted at 37°C\nin mixtures containing an RNA-DNA duplex substrate (20 nM) with RT\nenzymes in assay buffer, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 60 mM KCl, and 5 mM\nMgCl ~2~ . Aliquots were removed at different time points after\ninitiation of reactions and quenched by using an equal volume of\nformamide sample loading buffer (96% formamide, 0.1% each bromophenol\nblue and xylene cyanol FF, and 20 mM EDTA). The samples were heated to\n90°C for 3 min, cooled on ice, and electrophoresed through 6%\npolyacrylamide--7 M urea gels. The gels were analyzed by\nphosphorimaging.\n\n### RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity.\n\nThe same 497-nt RNA and 5′-end- ^32^ P-labeled D25 primers described\npreviously ( 44 ) were used to assess the polymerization efficiency of\nrecombinant RT enzymes in time course experiments. Final reaction\nmixtures contained 20 nM T/P, 400 nM RT enzyme, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8),\nand 50 mM NaCl. Reactions were initiated by adding 6 mM MgCl ~2~ and\ndNTPs at 200 μM to the mixtures, and the mixtures were sampled at 30 s,\n60 s, and 5 min, respectively, and mixed with 2 volumes of stop\nsolution. Reaction products were separated by 6% denaturing\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed as described previously\n( 44 ).\n\n### Processivity assays.\n\nThe processivity of recombinant RT proteins was analyzed as described\npreviously, using a heteropolymeric RNA template in the presence of a\nheparin enzyme trap to ensure a single processive cycle, i.e., a single\nround of binding and of primer extension and dissociation ( 44 ). The\nT/P was prepared by annealing the 497-nt HIV PBS RNA with 5′-end- ^32^\nP-labeled 25-nt DNA primer D25 at a molar ratio of 1:1, denatured at\n85°C for 5 min, and then slowly cooled to 55°C for 8 min and to 37°C for\n5 min to allow for specific annealing of the primer to the template. RT\nenzymes with equal amounts of activity and 40 nM T/P were preincubated\nfor 5 min at 37°C in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 50 mM\nNaCl, and 6 mM MgCl ~2~ . Reactions were initiated by the addition of\ndNTPs at 0.5 μM and a heparin trap (final concentration, 3.2 mg/ml), and\nthe mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 30 min; 2 volumes of stop\nsolution (90% formamide, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.1% each xylene cyanol and\nbromophenol blue) were then added to stop the reaction. Reaction\nproducts were denatured by heating at 95°C and analyzed by using 6%\ndenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging. The\neffectiveness of the heparin trap was verified in control reactions in\nwhich the trap was preincubated with the substrate before the addition\nof RT enzymes and dNTP.\n\n### Steady-state kinetics analysis.\n\nKinetics studies were carried out with a modification of a previously\ndescribed method using homopolymeric poly(rA)/poly(dT) ~12--18~ and\ncomplementary dTTP as the nucleotide substrate ( 44 ). The reaction\nmixture (10 μl) contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 60 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl\n~2~ , 5 mM DTT, 0.5 U/ml poly(rA)/poly(dT) ~12--18~ , RT enzymes,\nvariable concentrations of the tracer \\[ ^3^ H\\]dTTP, and cold dTTP (0.2\nto 200 μM). Reactions were run at 37°C and quenched by adding 0.2 ml of\n10% cold trichloroacetic acid and 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate to the\nmixtures, and products were filtered onto Millipore 96-well MultiScreen\nHTS FC filter plates (MSFCN6B) and sequentially washed with 200 μl of\n10% TCA and 150 μl of 95% ethanol. The radioactivity of incorporated\nproducts was analyzed by liquid scintillation spectrometry using a\nPerkinElmer 1450 MicroBeta TriLux microplate scintillation and\nluminescence counter. The steady-state kinetic parameters *V* ~max~ and\n*K ~m~* for nucleotide substrates were determined by nonlinear\nregression analysis of the substrate concentration and initial velocity\ndata using the Michaelis-Menten equation with the program GraphPad Prism\n5.01 according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions. The *k* ~cat~ was\ncalculated by using the equation *k* ~cat~ = *V* ~max~ /\\[E\\], where E\nrepresents the enzyme.\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### The N348I mutation delays or prevents the emergence of E138K in CBMCs under drug pressure.\n\nTo determine whether the N348I mutation, alone or in combination with\nM184V, might prevent the emergence of E138K under ETR or RPV pressure,\nwe introduced the M184V, N348I, and M184V/N348I mutations into the HIV-1\nNL ~4.3~ proviral clone and performed viral passage experiments in CBMCs\nusing increasing drug concentrations over a period of 19 weeks. Figure 1\nshows the weekly increment of drug concentrations employed. In the\nselection experiments with ETR and RPV, we were unable to increase drug\nconcentrations at the same rate as with the WT virus when the\nM184V/N348I double mutant virus was employed. With RPV, there was also a\ndelay in the escalation of drug concentrations with the N348I single\nmutant virus compared to the WT virus or virus containing M184V.\n\nFIG 1\n\nStepwise increment of drug concentrations in cell culture selection\nexperiments. The graph shows the weekly increment of ETR or RPV\nconcentrations for selection of resistant variants in cord blood\nmononuclear cells (CBMCs) using wild-type (WT) virus and viruses\ncontaining the N348I and M184V/N348I substitutions at baseline. CBMCs\nwere infected with viruses at the same multiplicity of infection and\ncultured in the presence of progressively increasing concentrations of\ndrugs.\n\nGenotyping was performed to verify the emergence of mutations ( Table 1\n). As demonstrated previously ( 9 , 37 , 38 ), E138K was rapidly\nselected by both ETR and RPV in the case of WT viruses and viruses\ncontaining M184V. However, selections of the M184V/N348I double mutant\nvirus by ETR or RPV did not lead to the emergence of resistance\nsubstitutions after 19 weeks. The results in Fig. 1 also show that we\nwere unable to increase drug concentrations at the same rate as when WT\nviruses were employed. These results indicate that M184V/N348I prevented\nor delayed the emergence of E138K. In addition, our results show that\nthe presence of N348I alone under RPV pressure led to the emergence of\nsubstitutions at positions V179 and Y181 but not E138K, thus altering\nthe mutational pathway seen with the WT virus. In addition, we were\nunable to increase drug concentrations at the same rate as with the WT\nvirus. These selections were performed on three different occasions,\nwith similar results being obtained each time.\n\n\n### The N348I substitution together with E138K diminishes viral replication capacity.\n\nThe N348I substitution was shown to impair viral replication capacity in\na variety of cell types, including HEK293T cells, Jurkat cells, Sup T1\ncells ( 25 ), MT2 cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)\n( 22 ). In addition, the E138K mutation impaired HIV-1 replication\ncapacity in a short-term viral replication assay in TZM-bl cells and in\na multiple-cycle viral replication assay in CBMCs ( 37 , 38 , 44 ).\n\nWe wished to investigate the impact of interactions between N348I or\nM184V/N348I and E138K on viral replication, and therefore, we performed\nmultiple-cycle viral replication assays in CBMCs. We infected CBMCs with\nrecombinant HIV-1 clones that were normalized in terms of inoculum on\nthe basis of p24 antigen ( 65 ). Quantification of virus production at\nvarious time points was carried out by measurement of p24 antigen. As\nshown in Fig. 2A , the relative replication ability of viruses\ncontaining E138K alone was impaired compared to that of the WT, while\nthe replication capacity of the E138K/N348I double mutant virus was\nfurther decreased compared to that of E138K alone. Interestingly, the\naddition of M184V to the E138K/N348I double mutant did not further\ndiminish viral replication, and in contrast, a slight compensatory\neffect on viral replication capacity was observed with E138K/M184V/N348I\ntriply mutated viruses. The order of replication capacity in CBMCs was\nWT \\> E138K \\> E138K/M184V/N348I \\> E138K/N348I. Thus, N348I further\nenhanced the replication deficit of viruses containing E138K.\n\nFIG 2\n\n\\(A\\) Comparative analysis of viral replication capacity in CBMCs. Viral\nstocks of WT HIV-1 ~NL4.3~ and the E138K, E138K/N348I, and\nE138K/M184V/N348I mutants were harvested by transfection of HEK293T\ncells and used to infect CBMCs through normalization of the p24 antigen\nlevel of the inoculum. Virus growth was monitored at the indicated time\npoints by measuring p24 antigen levels in cell-free culture media by\nELISA. Values are means of three independent experiments. Error bars\nrepresent standard deviations. (B) Comparative analysis of viral\nreplication capacity in TZM-bl cells. Viral stocks of WT HIV-1 ~NL4.3~\nand the E138K, E138K/N348I, and E138K/M184V/N348I mutants were\nnormalized for p24 antigen and used to infect TZM-bl cells. Luciferase\nactivity was measured at 48 h postinfection as an indication of viral\nreplication. The relative infectivity of WT HIV-1 ~NL4.3~ compared to\nmutant viruses is shown on the *y* axis, while the *x* axis denotes the\ninput of p24. Values are means of three independent experiments. Error\nbars represent the standard deviations. At p24 inputs of 8 × 10 ^5^\npg/ml and 2.4 × 10 ^5^ pg/ml, the relative replication of mutant viruses\nwas diminished compared to that of the WT virus. These values translate\nto a 3-fold virus replication disadvantage for E138K virus and 7- and\n5-fold disadvantages for the E138K/N348I and E138K/M184V/N348I viruses,\nrespectively, compared with the WT virus.\n\nPrevious results had shown that the replication capacity (RC) of HIV-1\ncontaining E138K was impaired by 3-fold compared to that of the WT virus\nin TZM-bl cells ( 37 , 38 , 44 ). Thus, we now also employed this cell\ntype and determined the impact of the E138K, E138K/N348I, and\nE138K/M184V/N348I substitutions on viral RC by infecting TZM-bl cells\nwith serially diluted viral stocks normalized on the basis of p24\nantigen. The infectiousness of the WT and mutant viruses was determined\nby measuring luciferase activity at 48 h postinfection. The results show\nthat the relative replication of all mutant viruses tested was\ndiminished compared to that of the WT virus ( Fig. 2B ). At p24 inputs\nof 8 × 10 ^5^ pg/ml and 2.4 × 10 ^5^ pg/ml, the relative RC of viruses\ncontaining E138K was decreased by ∼3-fold compared to that of the WT,\nconsistent with previous observations ( 37 , 38 , 44 ), while the\nreplication capacities of viruses containing either E138K/N348I or\nE138K/M184V/N348I were decreased by ∼7-fold and ∼5-fold, respectively.\nThe order of replication capacity in TZM-bl cells was WT \\> E138K \\>\nE138K/M184V/N348I \\> E138K/N348I, in agreement with the above-described\nfindings in CBMCs. N348I, alone or in combination with M184V, further\nimpaired the viral replication capacity of viruses containing the E138K\nsubstitution.\n\n### N348I enhances E138K-mediated resistance to ETR and RPV.\n\nIt has been shown that HIV-1 containing E138K displays modest phenotypic\nresistance to the newer NNRTIs ETR and RPV ( 37 , 38 , 44 , 66 ), as\ndetermined by a high-throughput short-term viral replication assay in\nTZM-bl cells. Next, we determined the impact of interactions between\nN348I or M184V/N348I and E138K on susceptibility to the NNRTIs ETR, RPV,\nEFV, and NVP using this same system. Table 2 shows that E138K conferred\nmodest levels of resistance to ETR (2.2-fold), RPV (2.6-fold), and EFV\n(1.8-fold) without impacting NVP susceptibility (0.7-fold). Levels of\nE138K-mediated resistance (fold changes of EC ~50~ ) were increased by\nthe addition of N348I for ETR (5-fold), RPV (5.6-fold), and EFV\n(4.1-fold). In addition, susceptibility to NVP was also changed from no\nresistance to low-level resistance (2.9-fold). These data indicate that\nthe addition of N348I to E138K enhanced resistance by 2.3-fold for ETR\nand EFV, 2.2-fold for RPV, and 3.8-fold for NVP. The enhancement of\nE138K resistance against ETR and RPV by N348I was further verified by\nstudies using an *in vitro* recombinant RT assay, as described below (\nTable 3 ). However, the addition of M184V to the E138K/N348I double\nmutant did not further enhance levels of resistance but rather\ndiminished resistance against ETR (2.9-fold), RPV (2.4-fold), and EFV\n(2.5-fold) to levels obtained with the E138K single mutant alone while\nnot impacting susceptibility to NVP (2.4-fold).\n\n\n### N348I diminishes the efficiency of DNA synthesis regardless of the presence of E138K.\n\nAlthough E138K is known to cause a decrease in RT polymerization\nefficiency at high dNTP concentrations, the addition of M184I/V can\nrestore the efficiency of processive DNA synthesis ( 44 ). To determine\nwhether N348I in RT can compensate for the diminished efficiency in\npolymerization associated with E138K, we performed RNA-dependent DNA\npolymerase reactions at high dNTP concentrations (200 μM) in time course\nexperiments for 30 s, 60 s, and 5 min using the WT, E138K, E138K/N348I,\nand E138K/M184V/N348I recombinant RT enzymes. RT molecules were used at\na ∼20-fold excess over the substrate so that any RTs that dissociated\nfrom the primer terminus during synthesis would be rapidly replaced and\nthe rate-limiting step would be the addition of nucleotides ( 44 , 67 ).\nThe efficiency of polymerization was calculated as the number of\nnucleotide additions divided by the reaction time, and the longest\nextension products at 60 s (indicated by arrows in Fig. 3 ) were used to\ncompare the polymerization rates of WT and mutant enzymes.\n\nFIG 3\n\nTime course experiments showing the effect of the E138K, E138K/N348I,\nand E138K/M184V/N348I mutations on the efficiency of RT processive DNA\npolymerization. The ^32^ P-labeled D25 primer ( ^32^ P-D25) was annealed\nto the 497-nt RNA template, and extension assays were performed with an\nexcess of recombinant RT enzymes at dNTP concentrations of 200 μM.\nReactions were stopped at 30 s, 60 s, and 5 min, respectively. All\nreaction products were resolved by denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel\nelectrophoresis and visualized by phosphorimaging. The sizes of some\nfragments of the ^32^ P-labeled 25-bp DNA ladder (Invitrogen,\nBurlington, ON, Canada) in nucleotide (nt) bases are indicated on the\nleft side. Positions of the ^32^ P-labeled D25 primer are indicated on\nthe right. The longest extension products generated at 60 s are\nidentified by arrows and indicate differences in polymerization\nefficiencies. Experiments were repeated at least twice, with similar\nresults being obtained each time. The figure shows a gel from a\nrepresentative experiment.\n\nThe results show that the WT RT enzyme showed a rate of processive DNA\nsynthesis of ∼3.2 nt/s, consistent with previously reported maximum\npolymerization rates for WT HIV-1 RT ( 44 , 67 , 68 ). The E138K/N348I\ndouble variant had a similarly diminished efficiency of polymerization\ncompared to that of E138K RT, i.e., ∼2.0 nt/s, while the addition of\nM184V, i.e., E138K/M184V, increased this value to ∼2.6 nt/s. These data\nconfirm that E138K/N348I RT is impaired in processive DNA synthesis in a\nmanner similar to that of RT containing a single E138K substitution. In\naddition, M184V was able to play a compensatory role in the efficiency\nof processive DNA polymerization in regard to the E138K/N348I double\nsubstitutions. This helps to explain how the E138K/M184V/N348I triple\nsubstitution results in higher replication capacity than when only E138K\nand N348I are present.\n\n### N348I-containing enzymes display diminished catalytic efficiency, as shown by steady-state kinetics assays.\n\nPrevious results of steady-state kinetic experiments showed that E138K\nRT has enhanced dNTP-binding affinity (lower *K ~m~* value) and can\nrestore the deficit in dNTP usage of RT containing the M184I/V mutations\n( 9 , 44 ). To assess the impact of N348I or M184V/N348I on\nE138K-containing RT on dNTP-binding affinity and catalytic efficiency,\nsteady-state kinetics studies were performed by using WT RT and the\nE138K, E138K/M184V, and E138K/M184V/N348I RT variants ( 9 , 44 ). The\nresults in Table 4 show that RT enzymes containing E138K/N348I and\nE138K/M184V/N348I variants had *K ~m~* values similar to those of WT RT\nfor dTTP but displayed diminished catalytic efficiency ( *k* ~cat~ / *K\n~m~* ), i.e., 34% and 39% of the WT value, respectively. As reported\npreviously, E138K has enhanced dTTP-binding affinity, as demonstrated by\na lower *K ~m~* value (0.6-fold of the WT value). The order of enzyme\ncatalytic efficiency is WT \\> E138K \\> E138K/M184V \\> E138K/M184V/N348I.\nThese findings showed that the N348I-containing E138K/N348I and\nE138K/M184V/N348I enzymes display impaired catalytic efficiency, in\nagreement with data presented above on viral replication capacity and\ngel-based polymerization efficiency.\n\n### N348I impairs RNase H activity in a background of E138K and E138K/M184V.\n\nSubstitutions at certain residues in HIV-1 RT can impair RNase H\nactivity and contribute to reductions in HIV-1 replication fitness ( 69\n, 70 ). In addition, some NNRTI resistance mutations are associated with\nimpaired RNase H activity ( 69 , 71 , -- 75 ), and N348I has been shown\nto reduce the rate of RNA template degradation ( 8 , 10 , 24 , 76 ).\nFurthermore, reduced RNase H activity may be associated with enhanced\nNNRTI resistance ( 77 ). To investigate the impact of N348I or\nM184V/N348I on the RNase H activity of E138K-containing RT, we monitored\nmulticycle RNase H-mediated RNA cleavage in time course experiments\nusing WT RT and the E138K, E138K/M184V, and E138K/M184V/N348I RT\nvariants. All of the E138K, E138K/N348I, and E138K/M184V/N348I mutant\nenzymes yielded the same cleavage profiles as did the WT enzyme but at\nlower efficiencies, as demonstrated by the relative band densities of\nthe uncleaved RNA substrate and the cleaved products ( Fig. 4 ). These\nresults show that the N348I and M184V/N348I substitutions, when\nintroduced into E138K-containing RT, did not compensate for the\ndiminished RNase H activity of E138K alone and may also contribute to\ndiminished viral replication capacity ( Fig. 5 ).\n\nFIG 4\n\nRNase H activity of WT and mutant recombinant RT enzymes. (A) Graphic\nrepresentation of the RNA/DNA (kim40R/kim32D) substrate duplex used to\nmonitor the cleavage efficiency of mutant and WT RTs. Positions of\ncleavage sites relative to the 3′ end of the primer are shown at the\ntop. The 40-mer RNA kim40R was labeled at its 5′ terminus by ^32^ P and\nannealed to 32-mer DNA oligonucleotide kim32D. (B) RNase H activity was\nanalyzed by monitoring substrate cleavage in time course experiments.\nThe time points were 0.2, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 10 min (lanes 1 to 6,\nrespectively). The uncleaved substrate and cleaved products relative to\nthe 3′ terminus of the DNA primer are indicated on the left.

The processivity of purified recombinant\nRT enzymes was analyzed by using a 5′-end-labeled DNA primer (D25)\nannealed to a 497-nt HIV-1 PBS RNA template as the substrate; the\nresulting full-length DNA (FL DNA) is 471 nt in length.

The\nfigure shows a gel from a representative experiment.\n\n### N348I does not impair enzyme processivity in a background of E138K and E138K/M184V.\n\nDiminished HIV-1 RT processivity is a determinant of impaired viral\nreplication capacity, and both processivity and viral replication can be\ninfluenced by the dNTP concentration ( 78 , -- 81 ). For example, the\nM184V mutation diminishes dNTP usage and possesses a deficit in enzyme\nprocessivity, which can be correlated with lower replication fitness in\ncell types that have small dNTP pools ( 78 , 82 ). However, enzyme\nprocessivity is not always directly proportional to viral replication\ncapacity, and both E138K and N348I have been demonstrated to compensate\nfor the deficit in processivity associated with M184V ( 8 , 26 , 44 ).\nTo investigate whether interactions between N348I or M184V/N348I and\nE138K might have an impact on enzyme processivity, we performed\ngel-based single-cycle processivity assays using recombinant WT RT or RT\ncontaining the E138K, M184V, E138K/N348I, and E138K/M184V/N348I\nsubstitutions at low dNTP concentrations. Figure 5 shows that only M184V\npossessed diminished processivity and that all N348I-containing RTs had\nprocessivity similar to that of WT RT, as demonstrated by the band\ndensity of full-length (FL) DNA products. The E138K mutant enzyme had\nhigher processivity than did WT RT, consistent with previous results ( 9\n, 44 ). These findings show that RTs that contain N348I, i.e.,\nE138K/N348I and E138K/M184V/N348I, do not have diminished enzyme\nprocessivity. Therefore, the lower replication capacity of\nN348I-containing viruses is not apparently due to a defect in RT enzyme\nprocessivity.\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThe recent introduction of the newer NNRTIs ETR and RPV into clinical\npractice and the identification of novel NNRTI-associated mutations have\nresulted in new patterns of drug resistance ( 42 , 83 ). ETR and RPV\nwere designed with intrinsic flexibility that allows efficient binding\nto a high-plasticity NNRTI-BP ( 84 , 85 ), and they are active against\nviruses that contain mutations associated with resistance to NVP and EFV\n( 86 , 87 ). Structural studies have revealed similar binding modes\nwithin the NNRTI-BP for ETR and RPV ( 84 , 88 , 89 ), indicating\ncross-resistance. Although three or more mutations are often required to\nconfer high-level resistance to ETR and RPV ( 36 , 39 , 90 , 91 ), the\nE138K substitution can confer cross-resistance to both of these drugs on\nits own ( 42 ). This study is the first to show that the connection\ndomain mutation N348I in HIV-1 RT can prevent or delay the emergence of\nE138K under ETR or RPV pressure while enhancing the levels of resistance\nconferred by E138K to these NNRTIs. We have also provided biochemical\nand virological evidence to show that this antagonism between N348I and\nE138K is due largely to an exacerbation of the impairment in enzyme and\nviral fitness associated with E138K and that this deficit cannot be\nrescued by the further addition of M184V.\n\nThe E138K mutation emerges both *in vitro* and *in vivo* and confers\ncross-resistance to ETR and RPV by reducing susceptibility 2- to 3-fold\n( 38 , -- 40 , 92 ), but E138K was shown to have no cross-resistance to\nNVP or EFV ( 40 ). In the ECHO and THRIVE clinical trials that led to\nthe approval of RPV for use in treatment-naive patients, E138K was the\nmost frequent NNRTI mutation at treatment failure ( 36 , 87 ),\nindicating that E138K is a signature mutation for this drug. In\ncontrast, E138K is much rarer in patients who have failed therapy with\nETR, even though this mutation confers resistance to ETR in tissue\nculture. One reason for this may be that the patients who received ETR\nwere almost all treatment experienced and harbored the N348I\nsubstitution that, either alone or in combination with M184V, can\nprevent or delay the emergence of E138K under ETR and RPV drug pressure,\nas shown here. It is notable that Y181C is also antagonistic with E138K\nand can prevent the emergence of E138K in cell culture under ETR or RPV\npressure ( 38 , 48 , 61 ). Y181C was present in the DUET studies\nconducted on the efficiency of ETR in treatment-experienced subjects in\n32% of patients at baseline ( 90 ); this explains the low prevalence of\nE138K in these trials. The present study makes clear that N348I can also\ndelay the emergence of E138K.\n\nM184V confers high-level resistance to 3TC and FTC and can impair viral\nfitness ( 31 , 32 ) while delaying the development of resistance to EFV\n( 93 ) or hypersensitizing to NNRTIs ( 94 , 95 ). M184I/V was also\ncommon, together with E138K, in patients who failed combination\nantiretroviral FTC/TDF/RPV therapy in the ECHO and THRIVE clinical\nstudies ( 36 ), due to mutual compensatory effects between the E138K and\nM184I/V substitutions in regard to enzyme processivity, polymerization\nefficiency, and viral replication capacity ( 9 , 43 , 44 , 96 ). A\nstrong association between N348I and M184V has also been observed, and\nthe selection of N348I is associated primarily with the use of ZDV and\nNVP ( 8 , 22 , 24 ). Biochemical and virological data have demonstrated\nthat N348I has a compensatory effect on M184V in regard to enzyme\nprocessivity and viral replication capacity ( 25 , 26 ). Previous\nstudies showed that M184I/V at baseline did not impact the emergence of\nE138K in CBMCs under ETR or RPV selection pressure ( 9 , 38 ). However,\nwe now show that N348I can restrict the emergence of E138K, even though\nthe addition of M184V to N348I does not reverse this antagonism. These\nfindings help to explain why E138K did not emerge spontaneously in\npatients who possessed M184V in order to compensate for the fitness\ndeficits associated with the latter mutation.\n\nWe have recently shown that E138K consistently emerges in CBMCs under\nETR selection pressure but not in MT2 cells that have larger dNTP pools\n( 37 , 48 ). We now also demonstrate that the addition of N348I to E138K\nfurther decreased viral replication in both cell types and that the\naddition of M184V to the E138K/N348I double mutant slightly increased\nviral replication capacity compared to E138K/N348I alone. These data\nhelp to explain the impact of N348I, alone or in combination with M184V,\non the emergence of E138K.\n\nThe presence of E138K alone, and the combination of E138K plus N348I,\nresulted in diminished efficiency of polymerization in a gel-based\nRNA-dependent DNA polymerase assay. The negative effect of N348I on\npolymerization was further confirmed by steady-state kinetic analyses,\nwhich showed that N348I further diminished the catalytic efficiency of\nE138K without significantly impacting dNTP-binding affinity. The\naddition of N348I or M184V/N348I to E138K did not impact enzyme\nprocessivity. Also, neither N348I nor E138K alone impaired enzyme\nprocessivity, and both were able to restore the diminished processivity\nof M184V ( 26 , 44 ). Although we used steady-state kinetics rather than\na pre-steady-state kinetic analysis, our data are in agreement with the\nresults of gel-based RNA-dependent DNA polymerase assays, which show\nthat the lower replication capacity associated with E138K/N348I and\nE138K/M184V/N348I is due mainly to a deficit in enzyme catalytic\nefficiency.\n\nOur data also indicate that N348I can enhance resistance to ETR and RPV\nin a background of E138K. Previous studies showed that N348I can\nincrease resistance to ETR ( 29 , 97 , 98 ). Now, we also show that\nN348I can enhance resistance to both ETR and RPV if E138K is also\npresent.\n\nIn addition to the nonemergence of E138K in patients who first possessed\nthe M184IV mutation, a related issue is why E138K did not appear in\ntissue culture selections performed exclusively with 3TC or FTC as a\nmeans of increasing viral fitness. Part of the answer may lie in the\nfact that the M184I/V substitutions result in diminished viral\nreplication capacity. A second reason may be that M184V is known to\nresult in increased RT fidelity ( 31 , 32 ), also making it less likely\nthat a subsequent spontaneous mutation might emerge. In order to provide\nfurther information on this topic, we are assessing the possible\npresence of E138K in 3TC-selected cultures using an allele-specific PCR\nassay, which is more sensitive than the population-based genotyping\ncarried out to date.\n\nAs N348I is not located at the NNRTI-BP, it is not clear how N348I\nenhances the resistance levels conferred by E138K to ETR and RPV.\nTransit-kinetic analysis has shown that E138K resistance to RPV is due\nmainly to an enhanced dissociation rate of RPV ( 11 ). N348I also\nconfers resistance to NVP through decreased binding affinity ( 8 ) while\ninhibiting RNase H activity ( 10 , 77 , 99 ). Further biochemical and\nstructural analyses may lead to the design of better NNRTIs with\nimproved resistance profiles and potency. Our study also supports the\nidea that the connection domain should be monitored in routine HIV\nresistance genotyping, because of its potential to enhance levels of\ndrug resistance.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that the N348I mutation alone or in\ncombination with M184V can prevent or delay the emergence of the E138K\nsubstitution by diminishing viral replication capacity. We have also\nprovided mechanistic insights into the reasons for this decreased\nreplication capacity. The copresence of N348I and E138K impairs RT\ncatalytic efficiency and also diminishes RNase H activity, while the\naddition of N348I to E138K enhances resistance to both ETR and RPV. Ours\nis also the first study to show that a connection domain mutation can\nhave an antagonistic interaction with a NNRTI RAM in terms of enzymatic\nfunction and viral replication.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 25355888\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: We show that V111I does not strongly affect drug susceptibility but increases the replication capacity of the K65R and Q151M viruses.

Although the primary H51Y substitution did not confer resistance against DTG or RAL (FC values of 1.25 and 0.98, respectively), consistent with previous results ( 11 ), the addition of R262K did result in low-level but significant biochemical resistance to DTG but not to RAL (FC values of 1.9 and 0.92, respectively).\"\nRationale: The paper includes in vitro drug susceptibility data, specifically examining the susceptibility of HIV-1 to dolutegravir (DTG) and raltegravir (RAL) using short-term resistance assays with TZM-bl cells.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 37303226\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Methods:\nWT clinical isolates (n = 6) and viruses harbouring common NRTI and NNRTI RAMs (n = 6) were serially passaged in escalating concentrations of doravirine, doravirine/islatravir, doravirine/lamivudine and rilpivirine over 24 weeks. Genotypic analysis ascertained the appearance and accumulation of NNRTI RAMs. Phenotypic drug susceptibility assays assessed resistance conferred by acquired NNRTI RAMs.\nResults:\nFor WT viruses, doravirine pressure led to the appearance of V108I or V106A/I/M RAMs after 8 weeks, conferring low-level (~2-fold) resistance. After 24 weeks, the accumulation of three to six secondary RAMs, including F227L, M230L, L234I and/or Y318, resulted in high-level (>100-fold) resistance to doravirine. Notably, viruses with these doravirine RAMs remained susceptible to rilpivirine and efavirenz. This contrasted with rilpivirine where acquisition of E138K, L100I and/or K101E resulted in >50-fold cross-resistance to all NNRTIs. Doravirine selection of viruses bearing common NRTI and NNRTI RAMs showed delayed acquisition of RAMs compared with WT virus.

This work was designed to determine the effects of a\nnovel mutation, D404N, in the connection subdomain of RT of HIV-1\nCRF08_BC subtype on drug resistance, viral replication capacity (RC) and\nRT activity.\n\n### Methods\n\nMutation D404N, alone or together with the other reported mutations, was\nintroduced into an HIV-1 CRF08_BC subtype infectious clone by\nsite-directed mutagenesis. Viral susceptibility to nine RT inhibitors,\nviral RC and the DNA polymerase activity of viral RT of the constructed\nvirus mutants were investigated. A modelling study using the server\nSWISS-MODEL was conducted to explore the possible structure-related drug\nresistance mechanism of the mutation D404N.\n\n### Results\n\nSingle mutations D404N and H221Y conferred low-level resistance to\nnevirapine, efavirenz, rilpivirine and zidovudine. Double mutations\nY181C/D404N and Y181C/H221Y significantly reduced susceptibility to\nNNRTIs. The most pronounced resistance to NNRTIs was observed with the\ntriple mutation Y181C/D404N/H221Y. Virus containing D404N as the only\nmutation displayed ∼50% RC compared with the WT virus. The modelling\nstudy suggested that the D404N mutation might abolish the hydrogen bonds\nbetween residues 404 and K30 in p51 or K431 in p66, leading to impaired\nRT subunit structure and enhanced drug resistance.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThese results indicate that D404N is a novel NNRTI-associated mutation\nin the HIV-1 subtype CRF08_BC and provides information valuable for the\nmonitoring of clinical RTI resistance.\n\n\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Cells, plasmids and drugs\n\nWe obtained 293FT cells from ATCC. TZM-bl cells were obtained from Dr\nJohn C. Kappes, Dr Xiaoyun Wu and Tranzyme Inc. through the NIH AIDS\nReagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH. The WT infectious plasmid\npBRGX was constructed and confirmed from a clinical isolate of CRF08_BC\nsubtype in our previous study. ^20^ Drugs, including four NNRTIs\n(nevirapine, efavirenz, etravirine and rilpivirine) and five NRTIs\n(zidovudine, abacavir sulphate, lamivudine, emtricitabine and tenofovir\ndisoproxil fumarate), were obtained through the NIH AIDS Reagent\nProgram, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH.\n\n### Site-directed mutagenesis and virus production\n\nEight mutation patterns in RT, including single (D404N, D404E, Y181C and\nH221Y), double (Y181C/D404N, Y181C/H221Y and D404N/H221Y) and triple\n(Y181C/D404N/H221Y) mutations, were introduced into the pBRGX plasmid by\nsite-directed mutagenesis as described previously ^21^ using AccuPrime™\nTaq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen). Details of the amino acid\nsubstitutions are listed in Table 1 . The presence of mutations in the\nplasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutation-specific primers and\nprimers for amplifying RT during positive clone identification were\ndesigned and are illustrated in Table 2 . Constructed mutants and WT\nplasmids were transfected into 293FT cells in six-well plates uisng\nLipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\\'s\ninstructions. Seventy-two hours after transfection, the viruses were\ncollected, aliquoted and stored in a −80°C freezer for future use. Viral\ntitre was determined by measuring p24 with a Vironostika kit\n(bioMérieux, France) and determining the TCID ~50~ in TZM-bl cells as\ndescribed previously. ^22^ Only those with p24 production \\>50 mg/L were\nsubjected to phenotypic drug resistance assay and analysis of RC and RT\nactivity.\n\n### Phenotypic drug susceptibility of the virus mutants\n\nThe susceptibility of the mutant viruses to NNRTIs (nevirapine,\nefavirenz, etravirine and rilpivirine) and NRTIs (zidovudine, abacavir\nsulphate, lamivudine, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate)\nwas measured in a single-cycle cell-culture-based phenotypic assay as\ndescribed previously. ^19\\ ,\\ 22^ In brief, TZM-bl cells (1 × 10 ^4^\n/well) were seeded into a 96-well flat-bottom plate. On the next day,\nmutant and WT viruses equal to 200--400 blue focus units (BFUs) in\nserially diluted drugs were added to each well of the plate in\ntriplicate. Wells infected with equal amounts of virus but without drugs\nwere included as virus controls. The plates were incubated at 37°C in a\n5% CO ~2~ incubator for 48 h. After the cells had been fixed and\nstained, the number of blue cells was calculated using ImmunoSpot 3.2\nsoftware after being imaged with an ELIspot plate reader (Cellular\nTechnology Limited, C.T.L.). IC ~50~ values were determined using\nSigmaPlot 12.0 software (four-parameter logistic analysis).\nSusceptibility to drugs was expressed as the fold change in IC ~50~ of\nmutant virus compared with the WT reference virus. As in our previous\nreport, ^22^ drug resistance levels were divided into four groups\naccording to the fold change in IC ~50~ for the mutant virus relative to\nWT, i.e. high-level resistance (\\>20-fold), moderate-level resistance\n(4- to 20-fold), low-level resistance (2- to 4-fold) and susceptible (0-\nto 2-fold).\n\n### Determination of RC of the virus mutants\n\nThe RC of the mutant and WT viruses was determined in a modified\nsingle-cycle cell-culture-based assay as described previously.\n^8\\ ,\\ 23\\ ,\\ 24^ Briefly, TZM-bl cells (1 × 10 ^4^ /well) were seeded\nin a 96-well plate. On the next day, serially diluted mutant and WT\nviruses were applied to TZM-bl cells in triplicate for each dilution.\nThe subsequent steps were the same as described above for the phenotypic\nassays. RC was determined by normalizing the number of blue cells per\nmillilitre to the corresponding p24 concentration (mg/L) for each mutant\nvirus. Final relative RC was expressed as a percentage of the value for\nthe WT reference virus, calculated as follows: RC of test virus\n(%) = (blue cell number/ng p24 ~test\\ virus~ /blue cell number/ng p24\n~WT\\ reference\\ virus~ ) × 100.\n\n### RT activity assay\n\nThe effect of D404N on RT activity was assessed with an RT assay using a\ncolorimetric kit (Roche, USA) as described previously with some\nmodifications. ^21^ Briefly, 750 μL of viral supernatant was\nultracentrifuged at 4°C for 2 h at 100 000 **g** and the viral pellets\nwere resuspended in 75 μL of lysis buffer. Viral lysate was serially\ndiluted 4-fold in lysis buffer and the subsequent procedures were\ncarried out according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions. Each sample\nwas detected in duplicate. Viral RT activity was quantified and\nnormalized by the input amount of p24.\n\n### Modelling study\n\nThe models of HIV-1 CRF08_BC RT (1--560 amino acids) (WT containing D404\nand mutant containing N404) were built by homology modelling with HIV-1\nRT, nevirapine and RNA/DNA hybrid crystal structure 4PUO ^25^ using the\nserver SWISS-MODEL ^26^ with default parameters. The model was further\nanalysed using Discovery Studio 3.1 visualizer (Accelrys), and the\nRamachandran plot was examined to ensure that the structure of the model\nwas not in the unfavourable regions.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nThe data were evaluated for statistical significance with an unpaired\nStudent\\'s *t* -test using Prism (version 5.0, GraphPad, Inc.). Values\nof *P* \\< 0.05 were considered to represent a statistically significant\ndifference. Results are given as the mean ± SD of triplicate independent\nexperiments.\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Low-level resistance induced by single mutations\n\nFigure 1 shows that the mutation D404N conferred low-level resistance to\nnevirapine (3.5-fold), efavirenz (2.3-fold) and rilpivirine (2.2-fold)\nbut did not affect susceptibility to etravirine (1.7-fold). Viruses with\nthe single mutation H221Y were cross-resistant to nevirapine (2.4-fold),\nefavirenz (2.4-fold), etravirine (2.6-fold) and rilpivirine (2.3-fold)\n(Figure 1 a--d). Mutants with both D404N and H221Y showed low-level\nresistance to zidovudine (2.2- and 2.1-fold) but were still susceptible\nto all the other NRTIs, including abacavir sulphate, lamivudine,\nemtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Figure 1 e).\nAdditionally, viruses containing the single mutation Y181C displayed\nhigh-level resistance to nevirapine (119.4-fold) and low-level\nresistance to etravirine (3.6-fold) and rilpivirine (2.7-fold) (Figure 1\na, c and d). No resistance to efavirenz or NRTIs was observed in the\ncase of Y181C (Figure 1 b and e). However, D404E did not confer\nresistance to all the NNRTIs and NRTIs compared with WT (\\<2-fold)\n(Figure 1 a--e).\n\nFigure 1.\n\nPhenotypic analysis of the susceptibility of virus variants to RT\ninhibitors: (a) nevirapine (NVP), (b) efavirenz (EFV), (c) etravirine\n(ETR), (d) rilpivirine (RPV) and (e) NRTIs (ZDV, zidovudine; ABC,\nabacavir sulphate; 3TC, lamivudine; FTC, emtricitabine; TDF, tenofovir\ndisoproxil fumarate). The fold changes in IC ~50~ for virus mutants\ncompared with WT are shown. TZM-bl cells were infected with virus\nvariants and treated with serially diluted RT inhibitors. At 48 h\npost-infection, the number of blue cells, representing HIV infection,\nwas calculated. The IC ~50~ was estimated from the standard curve\nplotted by the percentage of reduction of blue cell numbers and serial\nconcentrations of inhibitors. \\* *P* \\< 0.05; \\*\\* *P* \\< 0.01; \\*\\*\\*\n*P* \\< 0.001.\n\n### Moderate to strong resistance induced by double mutations\n\nTo investigate the interaction between component mutations of double\nmutations with respect to drug susceptibility, viruses carrying\nD404N/H221Y or Y181C/D404N or Y181C/H221Y were generated and tested for\nsusceptibility to both NRTIs and NNRTIs. Results showed that the double\nmutation D404N/H221Y rendered the virus resistant to all the approved\nNNRTIs at a moderate level. Compared with H221Y, the addition of D404N\nsignificantly enhanced viral resistance to efavirenz (6.5-fold),\netravirine (5.7-fold) and rilpivirine (4.3-fold) (Figure 1 b--d). In\naddition, D404N in combination with H221Y also increased viral\nresistance to nevirapine (8.4-fold) (Figure 1 a), though this increase\nwas not statistically different from that induced by H221Y alone.\nSimilarly, compared with D404N, the addition of H221Y significantly\nreduced viral susceptibility to nevirapine, efavirenz, etravirine and\nrilpivirine (Figure 1 a--d). For the five NRTIs (zidovudine, abacavir\nsulphate, lamivudine, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate),\nthe virus with D404N/H221Y in RT showed no resistance compared with the\nWT reference virus (Figure 1 e).\n\nInterestingly, when D404N or H221Y was introduced in addition to the\nprimary mutation Y181C, mutant viruses showed a sharp decrease in\nsusceptibility to nevirapine (583.5-fold for Y181C/D404N and 555.0-fold\nfor Y181C/H221Y) (Figure 1 a) as well as moderate resistance to\netravirine (10- and 5.6-fold), efavirenz (4.1- and 4.6-fold) and\nrilpivirine (3.2- and 4.8-fold) (Figure 1 b--d). Compared with Y181C,\nthe addition of D404N significantly increased resistance to nevirapine,\nefavirenz and etravirine (Figure 1 a--c). Likewise, the addition of\nH221Y also significantly enhanced viral resistance to nevirapine,\nefavirenz and rilpivirine compared with Y181C alone (Figure 1 a--c). The\ncombination of D404N or H221Y with Y181C did not influence viral\nsusceptibility to the NRTIs (Figure 1 e).\n\n### High-level cross-resistance to NNRTIs induced by multiple mutations\n\nWe further examined the resistance to reverse transcription inhibitors\nof viruses carrying multiple mutations (D404N, H221Y and Y181C). Our\nresults demonstrated \\>2000-fold increase in resistance to nevirapine\nwhen these three mutations co-existed. A moderate level of resistance\nwas also observed for three other NNRTIs (efavirenz, 9.7-fold;\netravirine, 16.1-fold; rilpivirine, 7.5-fold) (Figure 1 b--d) relative\nto the WT reference virus. Of note, compared with Y181C/H221Y, the\naddition of D404N significantly reduced viral susceptibility to\netravirine and rilpivirine (Figure 1 c and d). Compared with\nY181C/D404N, H221Y also significantly increased viral resistance to\nrilpivirine (Figure 1 d). However, the combination of the three\nmutations had no influence on the resistance to NRTIs (Figure 1 e).\n\n### D404N and H221Y impaired viral RC\n\nTo investigate the effects of D404N and H221Y on viral RC and the\ninteraction between them and Y181C, single-cycle cell-culture-based\nassays were performed. As shown in Figure 2 , the RC of the virus\ncontaining a single D404N mutation was decreased by ∼50% in comparison\nwith that of the WT virus. The single H221Y mutant displayed the lowest\nRC (30.95%). The combination of D404N and H221Y had a similar impact on\nviral RC (48.52% of WT) compared with either mutation alone. The above\nresults indicate that the presence of D404N, H221Y or D404N/H221Y was\nclearly able to impair viral RC. The virus with the single mutation\nD404E showed similar RC to WT (Figure 2 ).\n\nFigure 2.\n\nRC of HIV-1 virus variants. TZM-bl cells were infected with virus\nvariants without drugs. At 48 h post-infection, numbers of blue cells,\nrepresenting HIV infection, were calculated and normalized by the amount\nof p24. The relative RC of virus variants was determined by the ratio of\nthe blue cell number normalized by input p24 amount (BFU/p24) of mutant\nvirus compared with that of WT virus (%). \\* *P* \\< 0.05; \\*\\* *P*\n\\< 0.01.\n\n### Impact of Y181C mutation on viral RC\n\nThe RC of the virus with Y181C alone was close to that of the WT virus\n(84.26% of WT) (Figure 2 ). The addition of D404N or H221Y to Y181C did\nnot further suppress the replication of virus compared with Y181C alone.\nThis indicated that Y181C could completely compensate for the impaired\nRC of D404N or H221Y. However, when D404N was added to Y181C/H221Y,\nviral RC was significantly impaired compared with Y181C/H221Y, dropping\nfrom 106.17% to 46.86% relative to WT (Figure 2 ). Likewise, the\naddition of H221Y to Y181C/D404N also led to a significant decrease in\nviral RC in comparison with Y181C/D404N (Figure 2 ). In addition,\nviruses with Y181C/D404N/H221Y displayed significantly decreased RC\ncompared with those having Y181C alone. Thus, both D404N and H221Y are\ndeleterious mutations for viral replication and their co-existence\nresults in irreversible RC loss.\n\n### RT activity assay\n\nThe effects of these mutations on the polymerase activity of RT were\ndetected using a colorimetric kit. The template/primer included in the\ncolorimetric kit was a hybrid of poly(A)/oligo(dT) ~15~ and the included\nnucleotides were labelled with digoxigenin and biotin in an optimized\nratio. The signal to be detected was from the synthesized minus-strand\ncDNA and the activity determined by this kit was the RNA-dependent DNA\npolymerase activity of RT. Results showed that D404N conferred 2.6-fold\nand D404E 1.6-fold RT polymerase activity relative to that of WT. No\nstatistical difference was observed between other mutant viruses and WT\nreference virus (Figure 3 ).\n\nFigure 3.\n\nRNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of RT. The polymerase activity of\nvirus variants and WT virus was tested by a colorimetric RT assay. Viral\nparticles in the supernatant were concentrated by ultracentrifugation.\nFinal RT activity was normalized by the amount of p24. Results are\nexpressed as mean ± SD of two independent experiments.\n\n### Molecular modelling of RT of HIV-1 CRF08_BC\n\nNNRTI-related resistance is always induced by RT conformational changes\nresulting from the emergence of mutations such as Y181C and Y188C. To\ntest whether structural changes could be induced by the novel mutation\nD404N, the HIV-1 CRF08_BC RT model was built by homology modelling with\nHIV-1 RT, nevirapine and the RNA/DNA hybrid crystal structure (4PUO)\nthrough the server SWISS-MODEL. As shown in Figure 4 (a), residue D404\nis adjacent to K30 in p51 and K431 in the p66 subunit. Since aspartic\nacid (D) is a negatively charged amino acid and lysine (K) is a\npositively charged amino acid, it is apparent in Figure 4 (b) that the\nnegatively charged oxygen in the carboxylate radical group (red) in the\nside chain of D404 is in close proximity to the positively charged\nhydrogen in the amine group (blue) of K30 and K431. Therefore, a\nhydrogen bond can form between D404 and K30 or K431. When D404 is\nreplaced with N404, the negatively charged O ^−^ will be replaced by\nneutral NH ~2~ and the hydrogen bonds will be abolished. The residues\nwithin 4 Å (hydrogen bond distance) from residue 404 were highlighted\nand mainly restricted to the helix of 400--406.\n\nFigure 4.\n\nD404N RT models. (a) The models are shown as ribbon diagrams. Subunits\nof p66 and p51 are coloured cyan and purple, respectively. Residue 404\nand its vicinal amino acids on both subunits are highlighted. The atoms\nof residue 404 are labelled with balls and those of lysine 30 and 431\nwith sticks. The DNA/RNA hybrid is shown in tube format, coloured grey.\n(b) Subunits of p66 and p51 in WT RT with D404 are coloured cyan and\npurple, respectively, and those in mutant RT with N404 are coloured\ncopper and khaki, respectively. Red, oxygen atom; blue, nitrogen atom;\ngrey, carbon atom. The figures were produced using DS visualizer\n(Accelrys).\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe current study characterized a novel NNRTI-related mutation D404N in\nRT, which was selected previously by nevirapine during *in vitro* cell\nculture. ^19^ D404N not only conferred low-level resistance to\nnevirapine, efavirenz, rilpivirine and zidovudine when it was the only\nmutation, but also increased resistance to all NNRTIs when it was\ncombined with H221Y or Y181C. Viruses with D404N or H221Y displayed\nimpaired RC that could be compensated by Y181C. The combination of\nD404N, H221Y and Y181C significantly reduced susceptibility to NNRTIs,\naccompanied with a great loss of viral RC.\n\nHere, D404N is described as a novel NNRTI-associated mutation because it\nhas not been reported to be associated with NNRTI resistance in the\nStanford HIV Drug Resistance Database ( http://hivdb.stanford.edu ) or\nby the International AIDS Society in the USA. ^27^ Although D404N has\nnot been observed in patients infected with HIV-1 subtype CRF08_BC\nvirus, it has indeed been found in HIV-1 subtype C viruses from the sera\nof treatment-failure patients receiving an HAART regimen containing\nnevirapine and efavirenz, but not treatment-naive patients. ^1^ In\naddition, E404N was also found in one patient infected by HIV-1 subtype\nB with reduced susceptibility to delavirdine, efavirenz or nevirapine,\nwhile E404D was detected in four patients with reduced susceptibility to\ndelavirdine, efavirenz, nevirapine or zidovudine. ^8^ Besides, according\nto the HIV Drug Resistance Database of Stanford University (\nhttp://hivdb.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/RTPosMutSummary.cgi ), the\nsubstitution E404D showed a significantly higher frequency (\\>10%) than\nE404N (\\<2%) in ART-experienced patients. The higher frequency of E404D\ncompared with E404N in subtype B might be explained by a codon\ndifference. A single G-to-C transition at the third position of the\ncodon (E404D, GA G to GA C ) has a much higher chance of occurring than\na two-nucleotide substitution (E404N, G A G to A A C ). For HIV-1\nsubtypes CRF08_BC and C, however, mutation D404N requires only a single\nG-to-A transition (the most common RT error) at the first position of\ncodon 404 ( G AC to A AC). Since the viral genome of CRF08_BC subtype\ncontains two short fragments with GAG (residues 17--176) and RT regions\n(residues 102--200) of subtype B′ inserted in the backbone of subtype C,\n^19^ the connection subdomain sequence of subtype CRF08_BC is close to\nthat of subtype C. In this regard, the frequency of occurrence of 404N\nin subtypes CRF08_BC and C might be expected to be similar to and\ngreater than, respectively, that in subtype B. D404E did not confer\nresistance to all the RT inhibitors, which is similar to what was found\nfor E404 in WT of HIV subtype B and might explain why this D404E\nmutation did not occur in our previous selection cultures.\n\nPreviously, the emergence of D404N/H221Y in the Y181C mutant was found\nto significantly increase viral resistance to nevirapine. ^19^ To\nfurther confirm whether it was due to the effect of a single D404N or\nH221Y mutation or to the synergetic impact of both mutations and whether\nit was related to the presence of Y181C, we showed in this report that a\nsingle D404N mutation conferred low-level resistance to nevirapine,\nefavirenz and rilpivirine, but not to etravirine. This is similar to\nwhat was found for another mutation, A400T, in the connection domain of\nRT. One recent study reported that A400T reduced resistance to\nnevirapine 5-fold and efavirenz 2-fold but did not affect etravirine\nresistance. ^28^ Additionally, the N348I substitution in the connection\ndomain was associated with resistance to nevirapine, ^29^ while other\nmutations, such as E312Q, Y318F, T369I, T369V, A376S and I393L, showed\nlow-level resistance to nevirapine but had little or no effect on\nefavirenz and etravirine. ^6^ Furthermore, we found marginal resistance\nto zidovudine in the virus containing D404N, which was also reported for\nother amino acid substitutions, such as E312Q, G335C/D, N348I, A360I/V,\nV365I and A376S. ^7^ The functions of single Y181C and H221Y mutations\n(Figure 1 ) in drug resistance were also investigated and the results\nwere consistent with other studies. ^30\\ --\\ 33^\n\nNext, we performed drug susceptibility assays to further confirm the\ninfluence of double (D404N/H221Y, Y181C/D404N and Y181C/H221Y) and\ntriple (Y181C/D404N/H221Y) mutations. The addition of D404N to H221Y\nenabled the viruses to significantly reduce susceptibility to efavirenz,\netravirine and rilpivirine, which indicated that there was synergism in\nresistance to NNRTIs between D404N and H221Y. When D404N or H221Y\ncoexisted with Y181C in RT of HIV-1 subtype CRF08_BC, viral resistance\nto nevirapine was dramatically increased (\\>500-fold). Also observed\nwere a significantly higher level of resistance to etravirine (12.6-fold\nfor Y181C/D404N; 7.3-fold for Y181C/H221Y) and slightly increased\nresistance to efavirenz and rilpivirine. These results indicated that\nD404N and H221Y could enhance the resistance of Y181C to nevirapine and\netravirine. Some studies found that the Y181C and H221Y mutations were\nsignificantly correlated with resistance to nevirapine and efavirenz,\nwith an association *P* value of 7.2E-56. ^32\\ ,\\ 34^ Therefore, this\npathway warrants further analysis in clinical drug resistance mutation\ntests. Of note, the addition of D404N to Y181C/H221Y significantly\nincreased resistance to etravirine and rilpivirine compared with the\ncombination Y181C/H221Y. Lower susceptibility to nevirapine and\nefavirenz was observed for Y181C/D404N/H221Y compared with Y181C/H221Y,\nbut the difference was not significant. Highest resistance to all the\nNNRTIs was conferred by the accumulation of these three mutations\n(Y181C/D404N/H221Y).\n\nAfter confirming the effect of the D404N mutation on resistance to RT\ninhibitors, we also characterized its impact on viral RC using a\nsingle-cycle cell-culture assay in the absence of RT inhibitors. Viral\nRC refers to the ability of the virus to adapt and reproduce in a\ndefined environment. ^35^ It is different from RT activity, which refers\nto the whole reverse transcription process from the viral single-strand\nRNA genome to double-strand DNA, including RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA\npolymerase activity and RNase H activity. ^36^ RC depends on multiple\nviral and host factors such as the events involved in the virus life\ncycle and selective factors such as drugs. Reverse transcription by\nviral RT is an important event during viral replication. Emergence of\nmutations in RT during therapy potentially affects viral replication.\nTherefore, we compared mutant viral RC with that of WT in the absence of\ndrugs to confirm whether the mutation has any impact on viral\nreplication. Our results showed that the single mutation D404N\nsignificantly reduced viral RC relative to that of the WT virus. This is\nsimilar to what was found for some NNRTI-related mutations, such as\nV106A, G190E and P236L, which were reported to confer reduced RC,\npossibly resulting from impaired RNase H activity. ^37\\ ,\\ 38^ The RC of\nviruses containing mutation Y181C was 84.26% of that of WT, consistent\nwith the result of another study in which the single mutation Y181C was\nalso observed to slightly reduce viral RC (∼1.5-fold) in the backbone of\npNL4-3 (infectious clone of subtype B). ^23^ Here, the RC and RT\nactivity of D404E were similar to those of WT, which indicates that 404E\ndoes not influence viral replication.\n\nAlthough D404N alone impaired viral RC approximately by half, with the\naddition of Y181C to D404N the RC was restored to 82.91%. This suggests\nthat Y181C is a compensatory mutation to D404N. It was reported that\nNNRTI-resistant HIV-1 viruses tend to persist in patients over long\nperiods of time after interruption of NNRTI therapy and have a higher\npossibility of transmission into new hosts than PI-resistant viruses\nbecause the NNRTI-resistant viruses have small to moderate impact on\nviral fitness. ^39^ Therefore, although the addition of D404N to Y181C\nincreased resistance to NNRTIs, it did not affect viral RC, which could\nenable the virus to persist or readily transmit to a new host.\n\nInterestingly, although no influence of the combination of Y181C with\nH221Y on viral RC was detected, the addition of D404N to Y181C/H221Y\nresulted in a significant loss of viral RC. In general, viral fitness\ndecreases as the number of mutations increases. ^40^ Our results\nconfirmed that the strong cross-resistance to NNRTIs induced by the\ntriple mutation Y181C/D404N/H221Y occurred at the price of a severe\nimpairment in RC. We also found that a single H221Y substitution\nsignificantly reduced the RC to 30.95% of the WT value. However, if\nH221Y co-existed with Y181C, viral RC was restored to approximately the\nWT level and was 1.3-fold higher than that occurring with the single\nY181C substitution. A similar result was reported by another group. ^41^\n\nResults in this report might be ascribed to conformational changes\ninduced by D404N. According to our high-resolution crystal structure\n(Figure 4 ) of the complexes of HIV-1 RT, nevirapine and RNA/DNA hybrid,\nresidue 404 locates in the helix αL (residues 394--404) on the interface\n^42^ and close to K30 in p51 and K431 in the p66 subunit. The change\nfrom negatively charged D404 to hydrophilic polar N404 might abolish the\nhydrogen bonds between D404 and K30 or K431. K30 is in the finger\nsubdomain of p51, while K431 is in the RNase H subdomain in the p66\nsubunit. The structure between the connection and the finger subdomain\nin p51, as well as the structure between the connection and the RNase H\nsubdomain in the p66 subunit, might be impaired and result in reduction\nof susceptibility to RT inhibitors. This structural change might also\ninfluence the RNase H activity of RT and affect viral RC. In our study,\nY181C also did not produce significant loss of polymerase activity,\nwhich is consistent with the results of other studies. ^43\\ ,\\ 44^\n\nIn summary, we identified and characterized a novel NNRTI-associated\nmutation, D404N, in the connection subdomain in the RT of HIV-1 subtype\nCRF08_BC. This is important because it is very possible for the mutation\nD404N to emerge in subtype CRF08_BC because it has been found in\npatients infected with HIV-1 subtype C and the connection subdomains of\nthese two subtypes are very similar. However, the emergence frequency of\nthe mutation D404N in patients infected with HIV-1 CRF08_BC subtype\nstill needs to be demonstrated in more clinical studies; besides\nnevirapine and efavirenz, D404N also reduced susceptibility to the\nsecond-generation NNRTI rilpivirine by itself or in the presence of\nother mutations, such as Y181C and H221Y. In addition, this mutation\ncould confer low-level resistance to zidovudine. Thus, the presence of\nthis mutation alone or in combination with Y181C might potentially lead\nto failure of HAART therapy including NNRTI; because Y181C could\ncompensate for the replication loss of D404N, viruses with these two\nmutations might persist in the host for a long time and be transmitted\nto a new host. CRF08_BC has become a prevalent subtype in China and\nstudies of novel drug-resistance mutations in this subtype have become\nincreasingly important. The results of this study are valuable because\nthey facilitate the development of novel RT inhibitors and the\nprevention of therapy failure.\n\n## Funding\n\nThis work was supported in part by grants from the AIDS Trust Fund of\nHong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People\\'s Republic of\nChina.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 25385110\nQuestion ID: 13\nQuestion: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\nEvidence: In vitro resistance selection of subtype B virus (MT4-green fluorescent protein [GFP] cells), as well as subtype A and C viruses (MT4-GFP/CCR5 cells) was conducted with DOR, rilpivirine (RPV), and efavirine (EFV) under low-multiplicity-of-infection conditions in a 96-well format.

Anstett, T. Mesplede, M. Oliveira, V.\nCutillas, and M. A. Wainberg, J Virol **89:** 4681--4684, 2015, doi:\n10.1128/JVI.03485-14 ). Since many patients failing RAL/EVG are given\nDTG as part of rescue therapy, and given that the N155H substitution\noften is found in combination with other compensatory resistance\nmutations in such individuals, we investigated the effects of multiple\nsuch substitutions within integrase (IN) on each of integrase function,\nHIV-1 infectivity, and levels of drug resistance. To this end, each of\nthe L74M, E92Q, T97A, E157Q, and G163R substitutions were introduced\ninto NL4.3 subtype B HIV-1 vectors harboring N155H and R263K in tandem\n\\[termed NL4.3 ~IN(N155H/R263K)~ \\]. Relevant recombinant integrase\nenzymes also were expressed, and purified and biochemical assays of\nstrand transfer efficiency as well as viral infectivity and drug\nresistance studies were performed. We found that the addition of T97A,\nE157Q, or G163R somewhat improved the affinity of IN ~N155H/R263K~ for\nits target DNA substrate, while the presence of L74M or E92Q had a\nnegative effect on this process. However, viral infectivity was\nsignificantly decreased from that of NL4.3 ~IN(N155H/R263K)~ after the\naddition of each tertiary mutation, and no increases in levels of DTG\nresistance were observed. This work shows that the compensatory\nmutations that evolve after N155H under continued DTG or RAL/EVG\npressure in patients are unable to improve either enzyme efficiency or\nviral infectivity in an N155H/R263K background.\n\n**IMPORTANCE** In contrast to other drugs, dolutegravir has not selected\nfor resistance in HIV-positive individuals when used in first-line\ntherapy. We had previously shown that HIV containing the primary\nraltegravir/elvitegravir resistance substitution N155H could select for\nR263K under dolutegravir pressure and that this virus was fit and\ndisplayed low-level resistance to dolutegravir (Anstett et al., J Virol\n**89:** 4681--4684). Therefore, the current study aimed to uncover\nwhether accessory mutations that appear after N155H in response to\nraltegravir/elvitegravir were compatible with N155H and R263K. We found,\nhowever, that the addition of a third mutation negatively impacted both\nthe enzyme and the virus in terms of activity and infectivity without\nlarge shifts in integrase inhibitor resistance. Thus, it is unlikely\nthat these substitutions would be selected under dolutegravir pressure.\nThese data support the hypothesis that primary resistance against DTG\ncannot evolve through RAL/EVG resistance pathways and that the selection\nof R263K leads HIV into an evolutionary dead-end.\n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Experimental design.\n\nThe research objectives of this study were to evaluate the strand\ntransfer activity of recombinant integrase proteins expressing different\ncombinations of point mutations that confer resistance to RAL, EVG,\nand/or DTG. We also wished to assess the viral infectivity of equivalent\nNL4.3 viruses in the presence or absence of RAL, EVG, and DTG.\n\n### Cells and reagents.\n\nTZM-bl and 293T cells were cultured as reported previously ( 7 ). Merck\n& Co., Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., and ViiV Healthcare, Ltd., supplied\nraltegravir, elvitegravir, and dolutegravir, respectively.\n\n### Integrase strand transfer activity assay.\n\nSite-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously to\nintroduce the secondary mutations L74M, E92Q, T97A, E157Q, and G163R\ninto the pET15b ~N155H/R263K~ integrase subtype B expression vectors ( 6\n). Sense and antisense primer sequences are listed in Table 1 . The\ngeneration of the construct bearing the N155H/R263K mutations has been\ndescribed already ( 10 ). Recombinant integrase proteins were expressed\nin BL21(DE3) bacterial cells and purified as previously published ( 7 ).\nStrand transfer assays were performed using preprocessed HIV-1 long\nterminal repeat (LTR) DNA as reported previously ( 6 ). Briefly, DNA\nBind 96-well plates (Corning) were coated with LTR DNA and then\nincubated with purified protein. Afterwards, biotinylated target DNA was\nadded and plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 h to allow the strand\ntransfer reaction to occur. Integrated target DNA was quantified through\nthe use of europium (Eu)-labeled streptavidin, which stably binds to the\nbiotin tag of the target DNA molecules.\n\n### Generation of NL4.3 HIV-1 viral clones.\n\nThe generation of the pNL4.3 ~IN(N155H/R263K)~ plasmid has been reported\npreviously ( 10 ). Similar methods were used to generate other pNL4.3IN\n~(mutant)~ plasmids through site-directed mutagenesis using the primers\nlisted in Table 1 . Genetically homogenous viral stocks were produced as\ndescribed previously ( 7 ). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with\nthe various pNL4.3 plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000. At 48 h after\ntransfection, cell culture supernatants were collected and filtered at\n0.45 μm to remove plasmids and cell debris. Viruses then were aliquoted\nand stored at −80°C. Viral stocks were quantified by measuring cell-free\nreverse transcriptase (RT) activity in culture fluids.\n\n### HIV susceptibility to integrase strand transfer inhibitors.\n\nHIV susceptibilities to DTG, RAL, and EVG were measured by the infection\nof 30,000 TZM-bl cells using 100,000 RT units per well of each virus in\nthe presence of 1:10 serial dilutions of drugs. After 48 h, cells were\nlysed and luciferase production was measured using the luciferase assay\nsystem (Promega, Madison, WI).\n\n### HIV infectivity and replication capacity.\n\nHIV-1 infectivity was measured through the infection of 30,000 TZM-bl\ncells per well using serial 1:4 dilutions of the various NL4.3 viral\nclones. Levels of infection were measured as described above.\n\n### Statistical analysis.\n\nEach experiment is an average of at least two replicates performed in\ntriplicate ( *n* = 6). Biochemical assays of strand transfer activity\nwere normalized to wild-type (WT) activity at 1,600 nM protein ( Fig. 1A\n) or 128 nM target DNA ( Fig. 1B ). The relative infectivity index was\nnormalized to the wild-type 50% effective concentration (EC ~50~ ) (\nTable 2 ). Fold change (FC) was normalized to the wild-type IC ~50~ (\nTable 3 ). *K ~m~* , *V* ~max~ , infectivity index, IC ~50~ , standard\nerrors of the means (SEM), and 95% confidence intervals were calculated\nusing Prism 6.0 software, and all figures were visualized using the same\nsoftware. Student\\'s *t* tests were performed using the OpenEpi toolkit,\naccessible for free online at www.openepi.com .\n\nFIG 1\n\nStrand transfer activities of purified recombinant integrase proteins in\na biochemical assay.

All\nproteins displayed maximal activity at a concentration of 400 nM, except\nfor E92Q/N155H/R263K, which was maximally active at 200 nM. The\nN155H/R263K and N155H/G163R/R263K proteins displayed similar activities\nat both concentrations listed above. The N155H/R263K mutant was less\nactive than the WT at 400 nM, and this decrease was exacerbated by the\naddition of each of the tertiary mutations, especially L74M, E92Q, and\nG163R. All proteins lost activity at higher concentrations, and this may\nbe due to the formation of higher-order inactive integrase oligomers.\n\nFigure 1B depicts the strand transfer activities of the recombinant\nproteins when target DNA concentration was varied. As the substrate of\nthe enzyme increases, so does the activity of the protein until\nattainment of maximal activity, i.e., *V* ~max~ . All mutants in this\nstudy exhibited both a lower *V* ~max~ and a shallower curve compared to\nthat of the WT; the E92Q/N155H/R263K-containing protein was especially\ninactive, while the other triple mutants appeared to perform in a\nsimilar fashion to each other.\n\nFrom the curves in Fig. 1B , we derived *V* ~max~ and *K ~m~* values,\nthe latter being a measure of enzyme affinity for substrate. Figure 1C\nshows the changes in *K ~m~* upon the addition of each mutation. An\nincreased *K ~m~* is indicative of a decrease in affinity for the target\nDNA. The results show that *K ~m~* was significantly increased ( *P* ≥\n0.05) upon the addition of any mutation compared to the level of the WT.\nCompared to N155H/R263K, the addition of T97A, E157Q, or G163R each was\nable to significantly reduce the *K ~m~* of integrase, whereas the\naddition of L74M or E92Q was not. In fact, the\nE92Q/N155H/R263K-containing enzyme was so inactive that an accurate *K\n~m~* could not be determined. When *V* ~max~ / *K ~m~* , which is a\nmeasure of enzyme proficiency, was considered, however, we saw less of a\ndifference among the various combinations of mutations. Although all\ndecreases in enzyme efficiency were significant compared to the level of\nthe WT, the results depicted in Fig. 1D show that the addition of each\ntertiary mutation did not have a significant effect on the efficiency of\nthe N155H/R263K-containing protein, although both the T97A/N155H/R263K\nand N155H/E157Q/R263K mutant proteins had increased *V* ~max~ */K ~m~*\nvalues. These results suggest that the addition of certain tertiary\nmutations to integrase containing the N155H/R263K resistance mutations\nincreased the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate but generally\nwere unable to improve enzyme performance.\n\n### The addition of accessory mutations to NL4.3 ~IN(N155H/R263K)~ makes HIV-1 less infectious.\n\nTable 2 summarizes the results of experiments assessing the infectivity\nof NL4.3 viruses harboring the N155H/R263K mutations \\[termed NL4.3\n~IN(N155H/R263K)~ \\], both alone and in combination with any additional\ntertiary resistance substitution that was studied. These values are\nderived from the infectivity curves displayed in Fig. 2 for each mutant.\nSimilar to what was seen biochemically, the data show that the addition\nof each single mutation caused a significant decrease in infectivity\n(here represented as an increase in the infectivity index relative to\nthe WT) when comparisons were made to either the WT or to the\nN155H/R263K double mutant. Thus, the decreased strand transfer\nactivities described in Fig. 1 correlate with a general negative effect\non the analogous viruses in tissue culture. This trend also can be\nobserved in Fig. 2 , which shows changes in luciferase reporter gene\nactivity as a function of increasing concentrations of virus.\n\nFIG 2\n\nInfectivity in TZM-bl cells of WT, N155H/R263K, and triply mutated NL4.3\nviruses.

When\nthe concentration of drug was low, the negative effect of each mutation\non viral replication was clearly seen. As drug concentration was\nincreased, all of the mutants attained a growth advantage in the\npresence of drug and were able to replicate at higher drug levels than\nthe WT virus. The IC ~50~ s depicted in Fig. 3A and ​ andB B are\nsummarized in Table 3 . The addition of L74M to N155H/R263K virus\nincreased HIV susceptibility to DTG by ∼2-fold compared to that of NL4.3\n~IN(N155H/R263K)~ . Although resistance to DTG was relatively unchanged\nupon the addition of the other tertiary mutations, these same viruses\ndisplayed increased IC ~50~ s for RAL compared to those of either the WT\nor the N155H/R263K double mutant, with the exception of the virus that\ncontained G163R.\n\nFIG 3\n\nInfectivity of wild-type, N155H/R263K, and triply mutated NL4.3 HIV-1 in\nthe presence of increasing concentrations of dolutegravir (DTG) (a),\nraltegravir (RAL) (b), and elvitegravir (EVG) (c). Error bars indicate\nSEM.\n\nSimilar findings are displayed in Fig. 3C , with higher concentrations\nof EVG leading to a stepwise decline in infectivity of WT virus but not\nof the triple mutants, except at the highest concentration of EVG that\nwas used. The calculation of IC ~50~ s for EVG was not technically\npossible, because very high levels of resistance against this drug had\nbeen reached. Although the WT virus exhibits a nonstandard dose-response\ncurve in Fig. 3C , it is still evident that these mutants all are highly\nresistant, as their infectivity in increasing concentrations of EVG is\nunaffected, except at the highest concentration tested. This points to\nan extremely high level of resistance to this drug in our assay for both\nthe N155H/R263K double mutant and all triply mutated viruses.\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nAlthough combined antiretroviral therapy has revolutionized treatment\nfor HIV-positive individuals, drug resistance has been observed for\nevery class of drugs currently available ( 12 ). DTG is a promising new\nINSTI that may defy this paradigm but only if it used in first-line\ntherapy. In general, drug resistance is characterized by the initial\npresence of primary mutations that increase levels of resistance at the\nexpense of viral replication capacity. Secondary mutations that arise\nafter primary mutations generally are compensatory in nature and act to\nincrease drug resistance while also restoring viral fitness ( 13 ).\nHowever, previous results have shown that the secondary mutations\nassociated with DTG may counterintuitively diminish viral fitness\nfollowing the selection of a first mutation at position R263K.\n\nHere, we investigated the effects of adding common INSTI secondary\nmutations to an N155H/R263K background that we had previously\ncharacterized as a relatively fit, DTG-resistant virus ( 10 ). We now\nshow that the addition of any of five different tertiary substitutions\nhad different effects on the strand transfer activity of IN. In our\nbiochemical analyses, three mutations (T97A, E157Q, and G163R) improved\nthe ability of IN to bind target DNA but did not make a significant\noverall difference to enzymatic activity. Mirroring this, we saw a\nstatistically significant negative effect on infectivity upon addition\nof each accessory mutation relative to both WT virus and to viruses\ncontaining N155H/R263K.\n\nThere are varying and sometimes conflicting reports on how these\nmutations act to increase fitness and/or drug resistance in response to\nRAL or EVG. One study showed that the addition of E92Q or G163R to N155H\nwas able to increase viral fitness in both the absence and presence of\nRAL, whereas the accessory mutation L74M increased replication capacity\nonly in the presence of the drug ( 14 ). A different study showed that\nthe E92Q substitution in combination with N155H was deleterious to HIV-1\nreplication in the absence of INSTI pressure ( 15 ). The E157Q\nsubstitution has been shown to have variable effects on INSTI activity (\n16 , 17 ), while a T97A substitution has been reported to cause a 70%\ndecrease in viral replication relative to that of the WT ( 15 ).\n\nA recent study documented that viruses that contained the N155H mutation\ndid not select for resistance to DTG via the acquisition of common\ncompensatory substitutions; this finding is in agreement with our\nresults. Interestingly, the selection of E92Q/N155H/R263K in response to\nEVG was reported in that study ( 18 ), and we show here that this virus\nis highly resistant to this INSTI.\n\nIt is generally agreed that the five accessory mutations discussed here\ncontribute to higher levels of resistance to the older INSTIs RAL and\nEVG than do the primary mutations for these two drugs on their own ( 14\n, 15 , 19 , 20 ). In this study, we have expanded on these results by\nshowing that each triply mutated virus is just as or more resistant to\neach INSTI than the N155H/R263K double mutant, with the exception of\nL74M/N155H/R263K for DTG and N155H/G163R/R263K for RAL. Most important,\nwe have not observed significant changes in levels of resistance to DTG\nor RAL following the addition of any of these five compensatory\nmutations to backbone viruses. It appears that the presence of the R263K\nsubstitution that confers low-level resistance to DTG prevents the\ndevelopment of further INSTI drug resistance substitutions, and this\nlikely is due to its effects on viral fitness. Investigations are under\nway in our laboratory to identify the precise mechanism in the context\nof the three-dimensional structure of IN through which the R263K\nsubstitution confers low-level resistance to DTG while preventing the\ngeneration of additional substitutions.\n\nE157Q is particularly interesting because it is a naturally occurring\npolymorphism in HIV-1 subtype B ( 21 ), implying that it presents in\nsome patients at treatment initiation. E157Q is important because it\nconfers some resistance to RAL and EVG on its own ( 20 ); thus, it may\nfacilitate the selection of further resistance to these drugs.\nInvestigations in our laboratory also are under way to deduce whether\nthis polymorphism has an effect on the emergence of R263K and resistance\nto DTG. Indeed, a RAL-experienced patient who possessed numerous\nRAL-related mutations was recently reported to have failed DTG while\nalso possessing E157Q ( 17 ).\n\nA recent report from the P1093 DTG dose-ranging study identified a\npotentially nonadherent, treatment-experienced but INSTI-naive\nadolescent with low-level viremia and the emergence of the R263K\nsubstitution. In this case study, secondary resistance mutations were\nobserved that modestly increased the level of DTG resistance. However,\nnone of these substitutions were able to compensate for the decrease in\nreplicative capacity conferred by R263K, consistent with the data\npresented here and with previous results ( 6 , 22 , -- 24 ).\n\nDTG is approved for use in both first- and second-line therapy. In\ninitial therapy, DTG is unique in that no case of resistance against it\nor the nucleoside drugs with which it has been coutilized has yet been\nreported ( 25 , 26 ). However, when DTG is used as a second-line drug or\nin salvage therapy after prior failure on either RAL or EVG, it is far\nless effective due to cross-resistance against DTG that is conferred by\nRAL/EVG classical resistance mutations. The absence of resistance to DTG\nin initial therapy may be due to a relatively low level of resistance\nthat is conferred by R263K coupled with a significant diminution in\nviral replication ability. We hypothesize that the N155H/R263K\nDTG-resistant virus is not able to develop additional resistance\nsubstitutions or to acquire increased fitness due to constraints on\nviral mutability and replication that are primarily imposed by the R263K\nmutation ( 10 ). Indeed, the N155H substitution has been associated with\nDTG failure in treatment-experienced patients ( 11 , 27 , -- 29 ),\nincluding two INSTI-naive subjects recently reported in the SAILING\ntrial. Although this is the first documentation of N155H in patients\ntreated with DTG and not RAL, it is noteworthy that these two\nindividuals possessed non-subtype B viruses and showed only very modest\ndecreases in DTG susceptibility ( 30 ). Importantly, the combination of\nN155H and R263K has never been documented in individuals receiving DTG\ntherapy, but previous work has shown that these two mutations may not be\nincompatible in the context of the virus in tissue culture ( 10 ). The\ncurrent study suggests that this combination of mutations will not yield\nhigh-level resistance against DTG.\n\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Maureen Oliveira for technical assistance and Estrella Moyal for help with manuscript preparation.\n\nThis research was funded by grants from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR).

HIV susceptibility to DTG and RAL was determined using short-term resistance assays with TZM-bl cells, as described previously (8).\";  The addition of R262K to H51Y decreases HIV-1 susceptibility to DTG. To further characterize the R262K secondary substitution in the presence of H51Y, we performed resistance assays using TZM-bl cells and various concentrations of DTG or RAL ( Fig. 4 ), which generated EC 50 s for each virus as well as fold change (FC) values ( Table 2 ). Although the primary H51Y substitution did not confer resistance against DTG or RAL (FC values of 1.25 and 0.98, respectively), consistent with previous results ( 11 ), the addition of R262K did result in low-level but significant biochemical resistance to DTG but not to RAL (FC values of 1.9 and 0.92, respectively).\"\nRationale: The paper includes in vitro drug susceptibility data, specifically examining the susceptibility of HIV-1 to dolutegravir (DTG) and raltegravir (RAL) using short-term resistance assays with TZM-bl cells.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 26149983\nQuestion ID: 1\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\nEvidence: Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is an investigational prodrug of the HIV-1 nucleotide reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NtRTI) tenofovir (TFV), with improved potency and drug delivery properties over the current prodrug, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). TAF is currently in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Phase 1 and 2 studies have shown that TAF was associated with increased peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) drug loading and increased suppression of HIV-1 replication compared to treatment with TDF. In this study, selection of in vitro resistance to both TAF and the parent compound, TFV, led to the emergence of HIV-1 with the K65R amino acid substitution in RT with 6.5-fold-reduced susceptibility to TAF. Although TAF is more potent than TFV in vitro, the antiviral susceptibilities to TAF and TFV of a large panel of nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant mutants were highly correlated (R2 = 0.97), indicating that the two compounds have virtually the same resistance profile when assessed as fold change from the wild type. TAF showed full antiviral activity in PBMCs against primary HIV-1 isolates with protease inhibitor, nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), or integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance but reduced activity against isolates with extensive NRTI resistance amino acid substitutions.

TAF is currently in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Phase 1 and 2 studies have shown that TAF was associated with increased peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) drug loading and increased suppression of HIV-1 replication compared to treatment with TDF. In this study, selection of in vitro resistance to both TAF and the parent compound, TFV, led to the emergence of HIV-1 with the K65R amino acid substitution in RT with 6.5-fold-reduced susceptibility to TAF. Although TAF is more potent than TFV in vitro, the antiviral susceptibilities to TAF and TFV of a large panel of nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant mutants were highly correlated (R2 = 0.97), indicating that the two compounds have virtually the same resistance profile when assessed as fold change from the wild type. TAF showed full antiviral activity in PBMCs against primary HIV-1 isolates with protease inhibitor, nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), or integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance but reduced activity against isolates with extensive NRTI resistance amino acid substitutions. However, the increased cell loading of TFV with TAF versus TDF observed in vivo suggests that TAF may retain activity against TDF-resistant mutant viruses.\nRationale: The paper describes the resistance selection experiments conducted with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and tenofovir (TFV).

The R263K substitution seems to be incompatible with the\npresence of common resistance mutations associated with raltegravir\n(RAL), a different integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI). T66I is\na substitution that is common in individuals who have developed\nresistance against a different INSTI termed elvitegravir (EVG), but it\nis not known whether these two mutations might be compatible in the\ncontext of resistance against DTG or what impact the combination of\nthese substitutions might have on resistance against INSTIs. E138K is a\ncommon secondary substitution observed with various primary resistance\nsubstitutions in RAL- and EVG-treated individuals. Viral infectivity,\nreplicative capacity, and resistance against INSTIs were measured in\ncell-based assays. Strand transfer and 3′ processing activities were\nmeasured biochemically. The combination of the R263K and T66I\nsubstitutions decreased HIV-1 infectivity, replicative capacity, and\nstrand transfer activity. The addition of the E138K substitution\npartially compensated for these deficits and resulted in high levels of\nresistance against EVG but not against DTG or RAL. These findings\nsuggest that the presence of the T66I substitution will not compromise\nthe activity of DTG and may also help to prevent the additional\ngeneration of the R263K mutation. Our observations support the use of\nDTG in second-line therapy for individuals who experience treatment\nfailure with EVG due to the T66I substitution.\n\n**IMPORTANCE** The integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs)\nelvitegravir and dolutegravir are newly developed inhibitors against\nhuman immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). HIV drug-resistant\nmutations in integrase that can arise in individuals treated with\nelvitegravir commonly include the T66I substitution, whereas R263K is a\nsignature resistance substitution against dolutegravir. In order to\ndetermine how different combinations of integrase resistance mutations\ncan influence the outcome of therapy, we report here the effects of the\nT66I, E138K, and R263K substitutions, alone and in combination, on viral\nreplicative capacity and resistance to integrase inhibitors. Our results\nshow that the addition of R263K to the T66I substitution diminishes\nviral replicative capacity and strand transfer activity while not\ncompromising susceptibility to dolutegravir. This supports the use of\ndolutegravir in second-line therapy for patients failing elvitegravir\ntherapy who harbor the T66I resistance substitution.\n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Cells and reagents.\n\nTZM-bl and HEK 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco\\'s modified Eagle\nmedium (DMEM). PM-1 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial\nInstitute (RPMI) medium. Both DMEM and RPMI medium were supplemented\nwith 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM l -glutamine, 50 U/ml\npenicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cord blood was obtained from the\nDepartment of Obstetrics, Jewish General Hospital, Montréal, Canada.\nPrimary human cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) were isolated from\ncord blood by using Ficoll-Hypaque (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), and\nCBMCs were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. CBMCs were grown in RPMI\nmedium. Cells were maintained at 37°C under 5% CO ~2~ . RAL, EVG, and\nDTG were provided by Merck & Co. Inc., Gilead Sciences, and ViiV\nHealthcare Inc., respectively.\n\n### Generation of replication-competent genetically homogenous virus.\n\npNL4-3 ~IN(T66I)~ , pNL4-3 ~IN(R263K)~ , pNL4-3 ~IN(T66I/R263K)~ , and\npNL4-3 ~IN(T66I/E138K/R263K)~ were produced by using site-directed\nmutagenesis. The production of plasmids pNL4-3 ~IN(R263K)~ and pNL4-3\n~IN(E138K/R263K)~ was reported previously ( 10 ). The primers used for\nT66I mutagenesis were sense primer\n5′-CCAGGAATATGGCAGCTAGATTGTATACATTTAGAAGGAAAAGTT-3′ and antisense primer\n5′-AACTTTTCCTTCTAAATGTATACAATCTAGCTGCCATATTCCTGG-3′. All plasmids were\nverified by sequencing. To produce replication-competent genetically\nhomogenous viruses, 12.5 μg of plasmid pNL4-3 ~IN(WT)~ , pNL4-3\n~IN(T66I)~ , pNL4-3 ~IN(R263K)~ , pNL4-3 ~IN(T66I/R263K)~ , or pNL4-3\n~IN(T66I/E138K/R263K)~ was used to transfect HEK 293T cells by using\nLipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Fresh medium was added at 4 h\nposttransfection. After 48 h, culture fluids were harvested and passed\nthrough a 0.45-μm filter. Quantification of viruses was performed by\nusing p24 and reverse transcriptase (RT) assays as described previously\n( 12 ).\n\n### Tissue culture selections with RAL or EVG.\n\nCBMCs were infected with NL4.3 virus with wild-type integrase \\[NL4.3\n~IN(WT)~ \\], NL4.3 virus with the T66I substitution in integrase \\[NL4.3\n~IN(T66I)~ \\], or NL4.3 ~IN(E138K/R263K)~ virus and then grown in the\npresence of increasing concentrations of RAL or EVG. Viral replication\nin culture was monitored by an RT assay, and aliquots of culture fluids\nwere collected weekly. Viral RNA was extracted from the aliquots by\nusing an RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) and amplified by RT-PCR (Life\nTechnologies), as previously described ( 13 ). The PCR products were\nthen sequenced to detect the emergence of drug resistance mutations.\n\n### HIV-1 infectivity and replicative capacity.\n\nHIV-1 infectivity was measured by a short-term TZM-bl assay. Briefly,\n30,000 TZM-bl cells/well were infected with serially diluted viruses in\na 96-well flat-bottom plate. Cells were lysed 48 h after infection, and\nluciferase levels were measured to directly monitor short-term\ninfectivity. Fold decreases in infectivity were represented as the\nrelative 50% effective concentration (EC ~50~ ), which is the amount of\nvirus (previously quantified by using an RT assay) needed for TZM-bl\ncells to produce half of the maximal level of luciferase in an\ninfection. HIV-1 replicative capacity was measured as counts per minute\nin PM-1 cells following HIV-1 infection over 21 days. Both assays were\ndescribed previously ( 14 ).\n\n### Susceptibility to antiretroviral compounds.\n\nSusceptibilities of virus to ARVs were measured by the addition of\nserially diluted DTG, RAL, or EVG to TZM-bl cells prior to infection\nwith the viruses described above. Luciferase levels were measured after\n48 h of incubation, similar to the protocol for the infectivity assay\ndescribed above, and 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC ~50~ s) were\ndetermined.\n\n### Generation of plasmids for integrase protein expression and purification.\n\npET-15b expression plasmids coding for either the wild-type (WT) soluble\nintegrase or the soluble integrases that contained the R263K or\nE138K/R263K substitutions were generated by using site-directed\nmutagenesis, as previously described ( 10 ). The T66I, T66I/R263K, and\nT66I/E138K/R263K mutations were produced by using the primers described\nabove. The pET-15b plasmids were then used to express recombinant\nproteins in BL21(DE3) bacterial cells. The protocol for protein\nexpression and purification of His-tagged integrase was described\npreviously ( 9 ).\n\n### Cell-free strand transfer assay.\n\nIntegrase strand transfer activities of the WT integrase enzyme and\nintegrase proteins containing the T66I, R263K, T66I/R263K, E138K/R263K,\nor T66I/E138K/R263K substitutions were measured as previously described\n( 15 ). Briefly, 300 nM processed long terminal repeat (LTR)-DNA\nduplexes were coated onto Costar 96-well DNA-binding plates (Corning) by\nincubation overnight at 4°C. The plates were washed once with blocking\nbuffer (20 mM Tris \\[pH 7.5\\], 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% bovine serum albumin\n\\[BSA\\]) and then incubated with the same buffer for 30 min at 37°C or\novernight at 4°C. Immediately before the strand transfer assay, plates\nwere washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and assay\nbuffer {50 mM morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) (pH 6.8), 0.15%\n3-\\[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio\\]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), 50\nmM NaCl, 30 mM MnCl ~2~ , 50 μg/ml BSA}. A total of 400 nM purified\nintegrase proteins was resuspended in assay buffer with 5 mM\ndithiothreitol (DTT) and added to the microplates for a 30-min\nincubation at room temperature. Serially diluted biotinylated target DNA\n(0 to 60 nM) was then added to each well for 1 h at 37°C. The plates\nwere then washed twice with wash buffer (50 mM Tris \\[pH 7.5\\], 150 mM\nNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 2 mg/ml BSA). A streptavidin-Eu solution (50 μM\ndiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid \\[DTPA\\], 0.025 μg/ml Eu-labeled\nstreptavidin) diluted in wash buffer was added for 30 min at room\ntemperature. Finally, the plates were washed twice with wash buffer, and\n80 μl Wallac enhancement solution (PerkinElmer) was added. Time-resolved\nfluorescence was read by using a FlUOstar Optima multilabel plate reader\n(BMC Labtech).\n\n### 3′ processing assay.\n\nThe 3′ processing activities of the WT integrase enzyme or enzymes\ncontaining the T66I, R263K, T66I/R263K, E138K/R263K, and\nT66I/E138K/R263K substitutions were measured as described previously (\n16 ). The 3′ processing assay was similar to the strand transfer assay.\nSerial dilutions of the unprocessed LTR-DNA duplex with 3′ biotinylation\nwere used to coat the plates at concentrations of between 0 and 40 nM.\nAfter the addition of purified integrase proteins, the plates were\nincubated for 2 h to allow 3′ processing to occur.\n\n### Data analysis.\n\nEach experiment was performed at least twice using three or four\nreplicate samples. Data analysis was performed by using GraphPad Prism\n5.0.\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Emerging substitutions in NL4.3 ~IN(WT)~ , NL4.3 ~IN(T66I)~ , and NL4.3 ~IN(E138K/R263K)~ under RAL or EVG drug pressure.\n\nTo confirm previous findings and verify the possibility of\nT66I/E138K/R263K triple substitutions, selection studies were performed\nby using CBMCs infected with NL4.3 ~IN(WT)~ , NL4.3 ~IN(R263K)~ , and\nNL4.3 ~IN(E138K/R263K)~ with increasing concentrations of RAL or EVG (\nTable 1 ). Together with several substitutions, the T66I substitution\nemerged from the NL4.3 ~IN(WT)~ or NL4.3 ~IN(R263K)~ virus under RAL or\nEVG pressure, respectively, and from NL4.3 ~IN(E138K/R263K)~ with both\ndrugs. In contrast, the T66I substitution was not detected when RAL\nselection experiments were initiated with a virus containing the R263K\nsubstitution, nor did it emerge from the WT virus under EVG pressure.\n\n### Combining the T66I and R263K substitutions impairs viral infectivity.\n\nTo determine the effects of the T66I, E138K, and R263K substitutions on\nviral infectivity, TZM-bl cells were infected with NL4.3 ~IN(WT)~ ,\nNL4.3 ~IN(T66I)~ , NL4.3 ~IN(R263K)~ , NL4.3 ~IN(T66I/R263K)~ , or NL4.3\n~IN(T66I/E138K/R263K)~ virus ( Fig. 1 ). The NL4.3 ~IN(T66I)~ , NL4.3\n~IN(R263K)~ , and NL4.3 ~IN(T66I/E138K/R263K)~ viruses showed only\nslight impairments in infectivity relative to that of the WT ( Fig. 1a\nand ​ andc), c ), whereas NL4.3 ~IN(T66I/R263K)~ displayed a significant\ndefect in infectivity ( Fig. 1b ). Relative infectivity was decreased by\n8-fold by the T66I/R263K combination of substitutions. The addition of\nE138K to T66I/R263K partially restored infectiousness (1.45-fold\ndecrease in infectivity relative to that of the WT) ( Fig. 1d ).\n\nFIG 1\n\nViral infectivity in TZM-bl cells. (a to c) TZM-bl cells were infected\nwith NL4.3 ~IN(WT)~ , NL4.3 ~IN(T66I)~ , or NL4.3 ~IN(R263K)~ (a); NL4.3\n~IN(WT)~ or NL4.3 ~IN(T66I/R263K)~ (b); or NL4.3 ~IN(WT)~ or NL4.3\n~IN(T66I/E138K/R263K)~ (c) virus over 48 h, and luciferase levels were\nmeasured. Infectivity of NL4.3 ~IN(WT)~ virus is represented for\ncomparison. RLU, relative light units. (d) The fold decrease in\ninfectivity was calculated. Error bars indicate means ± standard\ndeviations.\n\n### The T66I/R263K combination of substitutions impairs viral replicative capacity.\n\nA single cycle of infection does not always capture replicative defects.\nTherefore, we also assessed the long-term replicative capacity of\ndifferent viruses that contained the T66I substitution using PM-1 cells.\nInfections were carried out with NL4.3 ~IN(WT)~ , NL4.3 ~IN(T66I)~ ,\nNL4.3 ~IN(R263K)~ , NL4.3 ~IN(T66I/R263K)~ , or NL4.3\n~IN(T66I/E138K/R263K)~ over 21 days ( Fig. 2 ). RT activity was measured\nin culture fluids at days 3, 7, 14, and 21. Similar to the results of\nthe TZM-bl infectivity assay, we found that the T66I substitution alone\nhad little effect on viral replicative capacity ( Fig. 2a ), and the\nR263K substitution decreased viral replication to a similar extent, as\npreviously reported ( 12 ). In contrast, the NL4.3 ~IN(T66I/R263K)~\nvirus showed a major defect in replicative capacity ( Fig. 2c ).\nAlthough the T66I/R263K-containing virus yielded levels of RT activity\nat day 3 that were similar to those of the other viruses tested,\nreplication gradually decreased over the subsequent 18 days, while the\nother viruses attained higher levels of replication at or after day 7.\nIn particular, the NL4.3 ~IN(T66I/E138K/R263K)~ virus showed a partially\nrestored replicative capacity in comparison to that of the NL4.3\n~IN(T66I/R263K)~ virus.\n\nFIG 2\n\nViral replicative capacity in PM-1 cells. PM-1 cells were infected with\nNL4.3 ~IN(WT)~ or NL4.3 ~IN(T66I)~ (a), NL4.3 ~IN(R263K)~ (b), NL4.3\n~IN(T66I/R263K)~ (c), and NL4.3 ~IN(T66I/E138K/R263K)~ (d) viruses over\n21 days. The replicative capacity of the above-mentioned viruses was\nnormalized to RT levels of the NL4.3 ~IN(WT)~ virus at day 7.\nSupernatants were collected at days 3, 7, 14, and 21, at which time RT\nlevels were measured as counts per minute. Error bars indicate means ±\nstandard deviations.\n\n### Strand transfer activities of recombinant integrase containing the T66I, E138K, and/or R263K substitution.\n\nTo determine whether the deficits in replicative capacity observed with\nmutated viruses in PM1 cells were caused by changes in integrase\nactivity, cell-free biochemical strand transfer assays were performed by\nusing purified recombinant integrases containing the T66I, E138K, and/or\nR263K substitution. Maximal enzyme activity ( *V* ~max~ ) and the amount\nof target LTR-DNA used to reach half *V* ~max~ (1/2MaxDNA) were\ncalculated for each of the recombinant integrase enzymes. The relative\n*V* ~max~ was measured for each recombinant integrase, and maximal\nstrand transfer activity of the WT integrase was arbitrarily set at 100%\n( Table 2 ). The results show that the presence of the T66I substitution\nincreased the 1/2MaxDNA value by 2.4-fold while decreasing the *V* ~max~\nto 67% of the WT level. Similarly, the R263K substitution increased the\n1/2MaxDNA value by 2-fold, and the E138K/R263K substitutions in tandem\ndecreased the *V* ~max~ to 38.7% of the WT level. For T66I/R263K\nsubstitutions, the 1/2MaxDNA value was increased by 2.3-fold, and the\n*V* ~max~ decreased to 13% of the WT level. The three substitutions\nT66I, E138K, and R263K together resulted in a slightly decreased\n1/2MaxDNA value (1.2-fold), but the *V* ~max~ was only 17% of the WT\nlevel.\n\n### 3′ processing activity of recombinant integrase enzymes containing the T66I, E13K8, and/or R263K substitution.\n\n3′ processing is a rate-limiting step in HIV-1 integration, and a 3′\nprocessing assay was performed to determine the effects of the T66I,\nE138K, and R263K substitutions on enzyme activity. The results show that\nno significant differences were observed among the various recombinant\nintegrase enzymes that were tested ( Table 3 ).\n\n\n### Virus with the T66I/R263K combination of substitutions confers significant resistance to EVG but remains susceptible to DTG.\n\nThe T66I substitution in integrase was previously reported to confer\nmajor resistance to EVG while increasing HIV-1 susceptibility to DTG.\nPreviously, we showed that the R263K substitution, alone or in\ncombination with several secondary mutations, conferred moderate-level\nresistance to EVG and low-level resistance against DTG ( 8 , -- 10 ).\nHere, we conducted resistance assays using TZM-bl cells to determine the\neffects of the T66I substitution combined with the R263K and/or the\nE138K secondary substitution on resistance to each of the drugs DTG,\nRAL, and EVG ( Table 4 ). Compared to the IC ~50~ of the WT, and in\nagreement with data from previous studies ( 17 ), the T66I substitution\nalone increased susceptibility to DTG by 1,000-fold and conferred\nlow-level resistance against RAL (2.4-fold) and higher-level resistance\nagainst EVG (10-fold). Viruses containing the T66I/R263K combination of\nsubstitutions were susceptible to DTG (0.089-fold), slightly resistant\nto RAL (1.6-fold), and more resistant to EVG (22-fold). The\nT66I/E138K/R263K virus was susceptible to DTG (0.027-fold), slightly\nresistant to RAL (2.5-fold), and highly resistant to EVG (164-fold).\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThe T66I substitution was originally described as a change in integrase\nselected in tissue culture under EVG pressure. It was later shown to be\ncommon in the genomes of viruses isolated from individuals failing EVG\ntreatment ( 18 ). Other substitutions that are associated with treatment\nfailure under EVG-based therapy include E92Q, G140S/A, S147G, Q148H/R/K,\nand N155H ( 18 ), the latter of which also emerged from the WT virus\nunder EVG pressure in this study ( Table 1 ). The T66I substitution can\nalso be found in viruses from individuals who have experienced treatment\nfailure with RAL although more rarely ( 19 ). This may be due to the\nhigh versus low levels of resistance conferred by this substitution\nagainst EVG and RAL, respectively ( 17 ), an observation that we have\nconfirmed here ( Table 4 ). In addition, we have confirmed that the T66I\nsubstitution does not confer resistance against DTG but significantly\nincreases HIV-1 susceptibility to this drug. Structural models derived\nfrom the crystal structure of the prototype foamy virus integrase\nprotein suggest that the T66I substitution might increase susceptibility\nto DTG by disrupting an electrostatic interaction between T66 and N155 (\n15 ). No single integrase substitution besides R263K has ever been shown\nto confer significant levels of resistance against DTG ( 17 , 20 ),\nhelping to explain the prevalence of the R263K substitution in some\ntreatment-experienced, INSTI-naive individuals who experienced DTG-based\ntreatment failure ( 7 ).\n\nWe have shown previously that the R263K substitution is also associated\nwith decreases in viral DNA integration and viral replication capacity (\n8 ), suggesting that the development of resistance both in tissue\nculture and *in vivo* involves a balance between levels of resistance\nand replicative capacity. The emergence of the T66I/R263K combination of\nsubstitutions in tissue culture selections with EVG has been documented\n( 11 , 21 ), and we show here that this combination severely impaired\nboth integrase strand transfer activity and HIV-1 replicative capacity (\nTable 2 and Fig. 2 , respectively). In contrast, the T66I/R263K\ncombination of substitutions has not been observed in the presence of\nRAL ( 19 , 22 ), suggesting that the low levels of resistance against\nRAL that are associated with this combination are not sufficient to\ncompensate for deficits in replication capacity, which are related to\ndecreased strand transfer integrase activity but not 3′ processing\nactivity ( Tables 2 and ​ and3 3 ).\n\nThe positive effect of the E138K substitution on strand transfer\nactivity seems to be due to an improvement in DNA-binding activity, as\nshown by decreases in 1/2MaxDNA values when this substitution was\npresent ( Table 2 ). In contrast, the E138K substitution had little\neffect on maximal strand transfer activity. These findings correlate\nwith the E138K-associated partial compensation for defects in\ninfectivity and replicative capacity that were observed with the\nT66I/R263K combination of mutations ( Fig. 1 and ​ and2). 2 ). The\naddition of the E138K substitution to the T66I/R263K combination also\nincreased the levels of resistance against RAL and EVG by 1.5- and\n7.5-fold, respectively ( Table 4 ).\n\nImportantly, the addition of R263K to the T66I mutation did not confer\nresistance against DTG, although it may have moderated the increase in\nsusceptibility to this drug that was associated with the T66I mutation\nalone ( Table 4 ). Furthermore, the T66I/R263K combination of\nsubstitutions severely impaired viral replicative capacity ( Fig. 2 ).\nThis suggests that patients who experience EVG-based treatment failure\nwith an emergent T66I substitution can be successfully treated with DTG\nand may not be able to develop the R263K substitution in combination\nwith T66I. Given the high prevalence of the latter substitution in\nindividuals who have failed EVG ( 18 ), our results provide additional\njustification for the use of DTG in second-line therapy after\ndevelopment of the T66I mutation.\n\nIn this study, we also tested the ability of E138K, a secondary\nsubstitution that has been observed together with the R263K substitution\nin tissue culture, to act together with the T66I/R263K combination of\nmutations to modulate strand transfer activity and replicative capacity\n( Table 2 and Fig. 1 and ​ and2). 2 ). However, viruses that contain the\nT66I/E138K/R263K combination of substitutions remained highly\nsusceptible to DTG ( Table 4 ).\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 25348535\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"The combination of H51Y and R262K substitutions slightly decreased susceptibility to DTG (fold change = 1.87) in cell-based resistance assays.

HIV-2 exhibits\nintrinsic resistance to most FDA-approved HIV-1 PI, retaining clinically\nuseful susceptibility only to lopinavir, darunavir, and saquinavir. The\nmechanisms for this resistance are unclear; although HIV-1 and HIV-2\nproteases share just 38 to 49% sequence identity, all critical\nstructural features of proteases are conserved. Structural studies have\nimplicated four amino acids in the ligand-binding pocket (positions 32,\n47, 76, and 82). We constructed HIV-2 ~ROD9~ molecular clones encoding\nthe corresponding wild-type HIV-1 amino acids (I32V, V47I, M76L, and\nI82V) either individually or together (clone PRΔ4) and compared the\nphenotypic sensitivities (50% effective concentration \\[EC ~50~ \\]) of\nmutant and wild-type viruses to nine FDA-approved PI. Single amino acid\nreplacements I32V, V47I, and M76L increased the susceptibility of HIV-2\nto multiple PI, but no single change conferred class-wide sensitivity.\nIn contrast, clone PRΔ4 showed PI susceptibility equivalent to or\ngreater than that of HIV-1 for all PI. We also compared crystallographic\nstructures of wild-type HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases complexed with\namprenavir and darunavir to models of the PRΔ4 enzyme. These models\nsuggest that the amprenavir sensitivity of PRΔ4 is attributable to\nstabilizing enzyme-inhibitor interactions in the P2 and P2′ pockets of\nthe protease dimer. Together, our results show that the combination of\nfour amino acid changes in HIV-2 protease confer a pattern of PI\nsusceptibility comparable to that of HIV-1, providing a structural\nrationale for intrinsic HIV-2 PI resistance and resolving long-standing\nquestions regarding the determinants of differential PI susceptibility\nin HIV-1 and HIV-2.\n\n**IMPORTANCE** Proteases are essential for retroviral replication, and\nHIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases share a great deal of structural similarity.\nHowever, only three of nine FDA-approved HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PI)\nare active against HIV-2. The underlying reasons for intrinsic PI\nresistance in HIV-2 are not known. We examined the contributions of four\namino acids in the ligand-binding pocket of the enzyme that differ\nbetween HIV-1 and HIV-2 by constructing HIV-2 clones encoding the\ncorresponding HIV-1 amino acids and testing the PI susceptibilities of\nthe resulting viruses. We found that the HIV-2 clone containing all four\nchanges (PRΔ4) was as susceptible as HIV-1 to all nine PI. We also\nmodeled the PRΔ4 enzyme structure and compared it to existing\ncrystallographic structures of HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases complexed with\namprenavir and darunavir. Our findings demonstrate that four positions\nin the ligand-binding cleft of protease are the primary cause of HIV-2\nPI resistance.\n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Cell lines, antiretrovirals, and wild-type molecular clones.\n\n293T/17 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection\n(Manassas, VA), and MAGIC-5A indicator cells were kindly provided by\nMichael Emerman (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA).\n293T/17 and MAGIC-5A cells were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO ~2~ in\nDulbecco\\'s modification of Eagle medium (DMEM; Mediatech, Manassas, VA)\nsupplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone,\nLogan, UT), 4 mM l -glutamine, 50 U/ml of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml of\nstreptomycin (Gibco Life Technologies Corp., Grand Island, NY).\n\nThe protease inhibitors amprenavir (APV), atazanavir (ATV), darunavir\n(DRV), indinavir (IDV), lopinavir (LPV), nelfinavir (NFV), ritonavir\n(RTV), saquinavir (SQV), and tipranavir (TPV) were obtained from the NIH\nAIDS Reagent Program. Master stocks (20 mM) were prepared in sterile\nhigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade dimethyl sulfoxide\n(DMSO; Alfa Aesar Co., Ward Hill, MA) and stored at −80°C. Serial\ndilutions of the drug were prepared in sterile distilled water and\nstored at −20°C.\n\nFull-length infectious clones of HIV-1 (pNL4-3; group M, subtype B) and\nHIV-2 (pROD9; group A) were obtained from Bruce Chesebro (Rocky Mountain\nLaboratories, Hamilton, MT) and Michael Emerman, respectively.\n\n### Site-directed mutagenesis.\n\nAn HIV-2 ~ROD9~ molecular clone encoding protease substitutions\ncorresponding to the amino acids found in wild-type HIV-1 (clone PRΔ4;\nI32V, V47I, M76L, and I82V) and clones containing each single\nsubstitution were engineered using the QuikChange II XL site-directed\nmutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All clones were sequenced\nacross the entire genome to ensure that no extraneous mutations occurred\nduring the mutagenesis process, and full-length plasmids were purified\nusing a Hi-Speed Plasmid Maxi kit with endotoxin-free buffers (Qiagen\nInc., Valencia, CA). Nucleotide sequences of the mutagenic primers are\navailable upon request.\n\n### Virus production and titer assays.\n\nVirus stocks were prepared by subjecting 293T/17 cells to\nchloroquine-mediated transfection of a standard quantity of plasmid DNA\n( 14 ). Viral supernatants were harvested and clarified by 0.2-μm\nfiltration. Single-cycle measurements of viral titers were performed in\nMAGIC-5A cells to ensure that mutant viruses were replication competent,\nusing fresh, 2-fold serially diluted 293T/17 supernatants in complete\nDMEM supplemented with 20 μg/ml of DEAE-dextran (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St.\nLouis, MO). Culture monolayers were fixed in 1% formaldehyde and 0.2%\nglutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then subjected to\n5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β- d -galactopyranoside (X-Gal) staining as\ndescribed previously ( 34 ). Focus-forming units (FFU) were counted by\nlight microscopy. Mean titers (expressed as FFU/milliliter) were\nobtained from two independent replicates.\n\n### Protease inhibitor susceptibility assays.\n\nThe susceptibilities of each wild-type or mutant HIV-2 molecular clone\nwere determined using a single-cycle assay as described previously ( 14\n). As described above, plasmid DNA was transfected into 293T/17 cells\nand then dosed with PI in half-log ~10~ concentration increments. The\nresulting culture supernatants were plated onto MAGIC-5A indicator\ncells, and virus growth was quantified by β-galactosidase (β-Gal)\ncleavage of chlorophenol red-β- d -galactopyranoside (CPRG; BioShop\nCanada, Burlington, Ontario, Canada). All CPRG assay values were\nbackground subtracted to normalize for intrinsic β-Gal activity. Fifty\npercent effective concentrations (EC ~50~ s) were obtained from at least\nthree sets of dose-response data using sigmoidal regression, log ~10~\ntransformed, and tested for statistically significant differences by\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) with Sidak\\'s test for multiple\ncomparisons. All statistical analyses were carried out in Prism (version\n6.0; GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using an α value of \\<0.05.\n\n### Structural studies.\n\nComparisons of existing crystal structures of HIV protease-inhibitor\ncomplexes were performed in UCSF Chimera ( 35 ). Structures used\nincluded HIV-1--APV (PDB code 3EKV \\[ 36 \\]), HIV-2--APV (PDB code 3S45\n\\[ 32 \\]), HIV-1--DRV (PDB code 4DQB \\[ 37 \\]), and HIV-2--DRV (PDB code\n3EBZ \\[ 31 \\]). To examine the structural changes responsible for drug\nsensitivity in the HIV-2 PRΔ4 mutant, amino acid changes I32V, V47I,\nM76L, and I82V were introduced into the wild-type HIV-2\nprotease-inhibitor complexes (PDB codes 3S45 and 3EBZ) using the\nRotamers tool in Chimera. The resultant structures were energy minimized\nusing YASARA ( 38 ). Similar structures were obtained using local energy\nminimizations performed in Chimera.\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Generation of site-directed HIV-2 mutant viruses.\n\nTo determine the importance of the four amino acid differences in the\nactive centers of HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases, we used site-directed\nmutagenesis of the HIV-2 ~ROD9~ molecular clone to generate clone PRΔ4;\nthis clone encodes protease substitutions I32V, V47I, M76L, and I82V,\nreflecting the amino acids found in WT HIV-1. We also generated HIV-2\n~ROD9~ clones encoding each substitution individually. When transfected\ninto 293T/17 cells, all five mutant clones produced infectious virus.\nThe mean titers of each mutant HIV-2 clone (4.4 to 4.6 log ~10~ FFU per\nmilliliter) were equivalent to that of WT HIV-2 ~ROD9~ (4.6 log ~10~\nFFU/ml).\n\n### Phenotypic PI susceptibilities of wild-type and mutant HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains.\n\nNext, we compared the sensitivities of WT HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ , WT HIV-2\n~ROD9~ , and HIV-2 PRΔ4 ( Fig. 2 and Table 1 ) to each of nine\nFDA-approved PI in a single-cycle assay. Relative to WT HIV-2 ~ROD9~ ,\nclone PRΔ4 was significantly more susceptible to all PI except SQV, to\nwhich HIV-1 and HIV-2 are equivalently sensitive. Changes in EC ~50~ s\nfor PRΔ4 versus WT HIV-2 ranged between 2.6-fold and 60-fold, depending\non the PI tested. The greatest increases in susceptibility between PRΔ4\nand HIV-2 tended to occur for PI with which WT HIV-1 and HIV-2 EC ~50~ s\nare most different, including NFV (10-fold increase), DRV (26-fold), APV\n(\\>43-fold), and ATV (60-fold). Compared to those for HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ ,\nthe EC ~50~ s for PRΔ4 were not statistically different, except for ATV\nand DRV, to which PRΔ4 was more susceptible ( Fig. 2 and Table 1 ).\n\nFIG 2\n\nPI sensitivities of wild-type HIV-1, wild-type HIV-2, and HIV-2 PRΔ4.\nBars indicate mean EC ~50~ s from single-cycle assays in 293T/17 and\nMAGIC-5A indicator cells, comparing HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ , HIV-2 ~ROD9~ , and\nHIV-2 ~ROD9~ containing protease substitutions I32V, V47I, M76L, and\nI82V (PRΔ4). Error bars indicate standard deviations. Means and standard\ndeviations were determined from three to eight independent assays. \\*,\nstatistically significant ( *P* \\< 0.05). ns, not significant. All\ndifferences between HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ and HIV-2 ~ROD9~ are statistically\nsignificant, except in the case of saquinavir.\n\n\nRelative to WT HIV-2, single amino acid substitutions I32V, V47I, M76L,\nand I82V conferred effects ranging from no change to a 12-fold decrease\nin EC ~50~ , depending on the PI tested ( Table 1 ). None of these\nchanges individually conferred significant increases in sensitivity to\nAPV, RTV, or SQV. However, compared to WT HIV-2, one or more clones were\nsignificantly more susceptible to ATV, DRV, IDV, LPV, NFV, or TPV, in\nsome cases with EC ~50~ s similar to those of WT HIV-1. However, no\nsingle change in HIV-2 ~ROD9~ protease conferred class-wide\nsusceptibility equivalent to that of HIV-2 PRΔ4.\n\n### Structural comparison of HIV-1, HIV-2, and HIV-2 PRΔ4.\n\nTo help interpret the results of our culture-based assays, we examined\nthe structures of HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases cocrystallized with APV and\nDRV ( 31 , 32 , 35 , 36 ). Importantly, HIV-2 is highly resistant to APV\nbut susceptible to DRV; these compounds are closely related, the sole\ndifference being the substitution of the tetrahydrofuran (THF) group of\nAPV with bis-THF in DRV ( Fig. 3 ).\n\nFIG 3\n\nChemical structures of amprenavir and darunavir. The locations of\nfunctional groups in the P1, P1′, P2, and P2′ sites of HIV-2 protease\nare shown for amprenavir; the same subsite orientation is used for the\ndarunavir structure (adapted from reference 32 ).\n\nIn the APV structures, WT HIV-1 and HIV-2 show similar orientations of\nthe inhibitor within the substrate-binding cleft ( Fig. 4 and ​ and5). 5\n). Interactions between APV and amino acids in the P1 and P1′ sites of\nprotease are conserved between HIV-1 and HIV-2, as are hydrogen-bonding\ninteractions involving the catalytic aspartates D25 and D25′, and\nresidues within the flap regions (and a coordinating water molecule) of\nthe two enzyme-inhibitor complexes ( Fig. 5 ). In contrast, subtle\ndifferences are apparent between HIV-1 and HIV-2 in the P2 and P2′\nsites. These changes include loss of a potential C---H···π interaction\nbetween position 47 and the aniline ring of APV, increased distance\nbetween the main-chain carbonyl of G48 and the aniline group (from 3.5\nto 3.8 Å for HIV-1 and HIV-2, respectively), lengthening of the distance\nbetween the main-chain carbonyl of D30′ and the THF ring (from 3.3 to\n3.5 Å), and lengthening of the predicted hydrogen bond between the D30\nmain-chain carbonyl and the aniline amino group of APV (from 3.3 to 3.7\nÅ) ( Fig. 4 ).\n\nFIG 4\n\nComparison of protein-inhibitor interactions for amprenavir (top) and\ndarunavir (bottom) in complexes with wild-type HIV-1, wild-type HIV-2,\nand PRΔ4 HIV-2 proteases. Oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms are\ndepicted in red, blue, and orange, respectively. The HIV-2 PRΔ4\nstructures were made by introducing amino acid changes I32V, V47I, M76L,\nand I82V into the wild-type HIV-2 protease-inhibitor complexes (PDB\ncodes 3S45 and 3EBZ) using the Rotamers tool in Chimera and energy\nminimized using YASARA. Water molecules coordinated by amprenavir or\ndarunavir and the main-chain nitrogen atoms of I50 and I50′ are shown as\nred spheres. The energy-minimized model of PRΔ4 HIV-2 with darunavir\n(lower right) did not contain a water molecule at this position. Dotted\nred lines indicate hydrogen bonds. Dotted black lines indicate potential\nhydrophobic and C---H···O interactions. Atomic distances are shown in\nangstroms.\n\nFIG 5\n\nPositioning of amprenavir and amino acids proximal to the P1 and P1′\nsites of wild-type HIV-1, wild-type HIV-2, and PRΔ4 HIV-2 proteases.\nBottom-row views are rotated 180° along the *y* axis relative to top-row\nviews for all structures. Amprenavir is shown in purple. Residues 76 to\n84 and 76′ to 84′ are shown as tan spheres. Yellow sticks indicate\nresidues 32:32′ and 47 to 50:47′ to 50′. Cyan sticks indicate residues\n27 to 30:27′ to 30′.\n\nWe then examined the structural changes responsible for APV sensitivity\nin HIV-2 PRΔ4 using an energy-minimized model of the HIV-2 structure\ncontaining the PRΔ4 substitutions. Compared to WT HIV-2, residues in the\nP1 and P1′ pockets of the HIV-2 PRΔ4 mutant maintain similar\ninteractions with the benzyl and isopropyl groups of APV, respectively (\nFig. 5 ), whereas P2 and P2′ show several alterations that could\npotentially influence APV binding. In the PRΔ4 model, the side chain of\nV47′, the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of D30′, and the main-chain\nnitrogen atoms of D29′ and D30′ are in closer proximity to the THF\nmoiety of APV (differences of 0.6, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.1 Å, respectively,\nrelative to WT HIV-2) ( Fig. 4 ). In the P2′ pocket, substitution of V47\nin WT HIV-2 with the longer isoleucine residue of the PRΔ4 mutant brings\nthe side chain of residue 47 0.8 Å closer to the aniline ring,\npotentially forming a new C---H···π interaction between the PRΔ4 mutant\nprotease and APV. In addition, in the PRΔ4 model, the main-chain\ncarbonyl group of D30 is rotated approximately 40° relative to the WT\nHIV-2 structure, resulting in a conformation similar to the one observed\nin WT HIV-1 protease ( Fig. 4 ). This rearrangement results in a shorter\nhydrogen bonding distance between the carbonyl oxygen and the aniline NH\n~2~ of APV (from 3.7 to 3.2 Å) ( Fig. 4 ).\n\nIn contrast to APV, complexes of HIV-1 and HIV-2 protease with DRV show\nlittle difference between the two HIV types. Protein-ligand interactions\nbelieved to be important for DRV activity ( 31 ), including hydrogen\nbonds and C---H···π and C---H···O interactions, are well conserved\nbetween HIV-1 and HIV-2, with differences of ≤0.2 Å between the two\nstructures ( Fig. 4 ). PRΔ4 protease interacts with DRV in a manner\nsimilar to both WT HIV-1 and WT HIV-2 enzymes. These findings are\nconsistent with data from our group and others showing that DRV exhibits\nsubstantial activity against WT HIV-1, WT HIV-2, and HIV-2 PRΔ4 in cell\nculture ( Fig. 2 ).\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nWe and others have previously shown that wild-type HIV-2 is at least\npartially resistant, *in vitro* , to the majority of PI FDA approved for\nthe treatment of HIV-1, retaining clinically useful susceptibility only\nto SQV, LPV, and DRV ( 13 , -- 20 ). Although it has long been known\nthat the active centers of HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases differ by only four\namino acids ( 23 ), this observation has never been fully investigated.\nWe report, for the first time, that replacing four active-site amino\nacid residues in HIV-2 protease with the corresponding amino acids from\nHIV-1 (I32V, V47I, M76L, and I82V) results in a replication-competent\nvirus which exhibits a pattern of class-wide PI sensitivity comparable\nto that of HIV-1.\n\nA few studies have suggested that the four differing active-center\nresidues may be responsible for the differences in PI susceptibility\nbetween HIV-1 and HIV-2. Modeling studies by Gustchina et al. revealed\nthat differences in the affinity of HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases to two\naspartic PI appeared to be due in part to I32V ( 27 ). Sardana and\ncolleagues mutated the four amino acid positions in HIV-1 protease to\nthe corresponding HIV-2 amino acids and performed enzyme activity and\ninhibition studies using purified proteases in the presence of three\ninhibitors: L-689,502, L-731,723, and RO 31-8959 (later licensed as SQV)\n( 29 ). Although their results supported the findings of Gustchina et\nal., the authors noted that substitutions at residues 47, 76, and 82 had\nrelatively minor effects on protease inhibition by these compounds. In\naddition, the HIV-1 mutant protease containing all four changes was only\nslightly resistant to the inhibitors, leading to the conclusion that the\nfour active-site residues would be insufficient to explain the\ndifferences in inhibitor sensitivity between HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases.\nThis observation was further explored by Hoog et al., who solved the\nstructure of an HIV-1 protease containing V32I, I47V, and V82I,\ncomplexed with the tripeptide analogue inhibitor SB203386 and compared\nit to previously solved structures of WT HIV-1 and simian\nimmunodeficiency virus (SIV) complexed with the same inhibitor ( 28 ).\nThey concluded that ligand specificity was imparted not only by the\nthree active-site residues tested but also by changes outside the active\ncenter.\n\nMore recent studies have explored the structural elements involved in\ndifferential APV and DRV susceptibilities ( 30 , -- 33 ). Tie and\ncolleagues examined structural and biochemical features of proteases\nfrom HIV-1, HIV-2, and HIV-1 containing V32I, I47V, and V82I ( 32 ).\nAlthough the overall structure of the HIV-1 mutant protease more closely\nresembled that of WT HIV-1 protease, its biochemical parameters were\nsimilar to those of the HIV-2 protease, and the interactions observed in\ntheir enzyme-APV structure for the HIV-1 mutant were also more similar\nto those seen in the HIV-2 structure. In keeping with the observation\nthat HIV-1 and HIV-2 display relatively similar sensitivities to DRV,\nthis study noted that hydrogen bond interactions in the DRV-containing\nstructures were very similar between all three proteases. This and other\nstudies have identified a number of electrostatic and hydrophobic\ninteractions thought to be important in the observed differences in\nsensitivity between SQV, DRV, and APV ( 30 , -- 33 ). Together, these\nstudies reveal that small rearrangements resulting from one, two, or\nthree amino acid substitutions in the substrate-binding pockets of HIV\nproteases result in changes in the internal interactions, which may lead\nto differing patterns of PI sensitivity.\n\nNo previous study has examined the drug sensitivity of HIV-2 variants\ncontaining these four amino acid changes, either alone or in\ncombination, using a live-virus assay system. Our results demonstrate\nthat in HIV-2 protease, amino acid changes I32V, V47I, M76L, and I82V\ncooperate to confer a level of PI susceptibility greater than the sum of\neach individual change. HIV-2 clone PRΔ4, containing the corresponding\nHIV-1 amino acids at positions 32, 47, 76, and 82, exhibits PI\nsusceptibility either equivalent to, or better than, that of HIV-1. The\nmechanisms causing the HIV-2 PRΔ4 clone to exhibit lower EC ~50~ s with\nATV and DRV than those seen in HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ are unclear and warrant\nfurther study. In HIV-1, PI resistance-associated substitutions occur\nthroughout the protease enzyme and can restore viral fitness and/or\nenhance the effects of primary resistance mutations. Amino acids outside\nthe HIV-2 protease active site may cause subtle changes in conformation\ncompared to HIV-1, which might impact PI binding affinity. Future\nstudies of different HIV-2 isolates from groups A and B with I32V, V47I,\nM76L, and I82V substitutions but with differing background polymorphisms\nin protease could help address these possibilities.\n\nThere are a number of other potential limitations to our study. We did\nnot compare *in vitro* enzymatic activity and PI susceptibility of the\npurified HIV-2 PRΔ4 enzyme to those of WT HIV-2 protease; however, we\ncontend that cell culture-based assays are a more realistic\napproximation of *in vivo* PI susceptibility. We also did not test\ncombinations of two or three amino acid changes within the four\nactive-site residues, so we cannot exclude the possibility that other\ncombinations of mutations at these or other sites would similarly\n\"resensitize\" HIV-2 to these compounds. In addition, our site-directed\nmutations were made in only one strain, HIV-2 ~ROD9~ , but the high\nlevel of amino acid conservation at these sites makes it less likely\nthat other strains would show dramatically different results. We did not\ngenerate and test the \"reverse\" PRΔ4 mutant in HIV-1 (that is, HIV-1\ncontaining the corresponding HIV-2 amino acids). However, many previous\nstudies have shown that single amino acid changes at Val32, Ile47,\nLeu76, and Val82 confer PI resistance (summarized in references 26 , 39\n, and 40 ). According to the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (\nhttp://hivdb.stanford.edu ), V32I is a major PI resistance-associated\nsubstitution, conferring resistance to fosamprenavir (FPV; a prodrug of\nAPV), ATV, DRV, IDV, LPV, and NFV. Similarly, I47V is a major\nresistance-associated mutation conferring decreased susceptibility to\nFPV, DRV, IDV, LPV, NFV, and TPV, respectively. Although neither L76M\nnor V82I is known to cause PI resistance in HIV-1, other substitutions\nat these positions are associated with intermediate to high-level\nresistance to multiple PI. The combined reverse PRΔ4 mutant in HIV-1\n(V32I-I47V-L76M-V82I) is predicted by the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance\nDatabase to have high-level resistance (\\>11-fold) to FPV, intermediate\nresistance (3-10-fold) to DRV, IDV, LPV, NFV, and TPV, and low-level\nresistance (\\<3-fold) to ATV and to retain SQV susceptibility.\n\nIn agreement with previously published studies using an earlier\nstructure of HIV-1 protease-APV (PDB code 3NU3) ( 30 , -- 32 ), our\nstructural analyses suggest that HIV-2 resistance to APV results from a\ndiminution or loss of stabilizing interactions between protease and the\nTHF and aniline groups of the inhibitor. It appears that the PRΔ4\nmutations help to stabilize APV in the P2 and P2′ pockets of HIV-2\nprotease, possibly accounting for the increased susceptibility of HIV-2\nPRΔ4 to APV in culture. The differences in DRV sensitivity between HIV-1\nand HIV-2 are relatively small in comparison to the differences in their\nsensitivities to APV, lending support to the observation that HIV-1,\nHIV-2, and HIV-2 PRΔ4 proteases interact similarly with DRV ( 31 , -- 33\n). Although crystallographic studies can provide important clues into\nthe structural mechanisms behind differential PI susceptibilities, there\nare important limitations to this approach. First, due to the dearth of\nX-ray crystallographic structures of HIV-2 complexed with PI, a\ncomprehensive analysis of the structural basis for the differences in PI\nsusceptibility between HIV-1 and HIV-2 is not possible. In addition, our\ncomparison uses models of PRΔ4 rather than a solved structure of the\nmutant enzyme and thus contains inherent uncertainty. In particular,\nthere is a coordinating water missing from the flap region of the active\nsite in the PRΔ4-DRV model, which could potentially reveal a problem\nwith the model. However, we believe this to be an artifact of the energy\nminimization process, as the relevant main-chain nitrogen atoms from the\nPRΔ4 protease, and the oxygen atoms of DRV that should coordinate this\nwater molecule, are appropriately positioned to coordinate a water\nmolecule at this site. Finally, although crystal structures demonstrate\nstructural changes in the enzyme-inhibitor interactions caused by amino\nacid substitutions, they may not adequately account for in changes in\nenzyme dynamic and thermodynamic properties that result from these\nmutations.\n\nTo date, no antiretroviral compounds have been developed or licensed for\nthe treatment of HIV-2; as a result, HIV-2 treatment relies solely on\ndrugs developed for HIV-1. Although the course of HIV-2 infection is\nrelatively protracted compared to that of HIV-1, with lower viral loads\nand slower decline in CD4 ^+^ T cells ( 41 , 42 ), without the benefit\nof antiretroviral therapy (ART), a substantial proportion of infected\nindividuals will progress to AIDS ( 43 ). Because of this, HIV-2 is a\nsignificant public health challenge in West Africa, where the virus is\nendemic ( 44 ). Although PI-based regimens are the mainstay of HIV-2\ntreatment in resource-limited settings, only a third of FDA-approved PI\nare HIV-2 active at clinically useful concentrations, and only one of\nthose agents (LPV/RTV; Kaletra or Aluvia) is widely available for\nclinical use in resource-limited settings.\n\nOur findings show that four residues in the protease binding pocket are\nthe primary determinants of intrinsic PI resistance in HIV-2, enhancing\nour overall understanding of the genetic basis of PI susceptibility.\nFurther, these results provide evidence that subtle structural changes\nimparted by a limited number of residues can cause dramatic functional\ndifferences between homologous enzymes from two closely related viruses.\n\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThe University of Washington Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) is an\nNIH-funded program.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 25808007\nQuestion ID: 9\nQuestion: Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?\nEvidence: \"Integrase substitutions E92Q, Y143C, E92Q + Y143C, and Q148R conferred relatively low levels of resistance to dolutegravir in HIV-2 ~ROD9~ (2- to 6-fold), but Q148K, E92Q + N155H, T97A + N155H and G140S + Q148R resulted in moderate resistance (10- to 46-fold), and the combination of T97A + Y143C in HIV-2 ~ROD9~ conferred high-level resistance (\\>5000-fold).

TAF is currently in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Phase 1 and 2 studies have shown that TAF was associated with increased peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) drug loading and increased suppression of HIV-1 replication compared to treatment with TDF. In this study, selection of in vitro resistance to both TAF and the parent compound, TFV, led to the emergence of HIV-1 with the K65R amino acid substitution in RT with 6.5-fold-reduced susceptibility to TAF. Although TAF is more potent than TFV in vitro, the antiviral susceptibilities to TAF and TFV of a large panel of nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant mutants were highly correlated (R2 = 0.97), indicating that the two compounds have virtually the same resistance profile when assessed as fold change from the wild type. TAF showed full antiviral activity in PBMCs against primary HIV-1 isolates with protease inhibitor, nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), or integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance but reduced activity against isolates with extensive NRTI resistance amino acid substitutions. However, the increased cell loading of TFV with TAF versus TDF observed in vivo suggests that TAF may retain activity against TDF-resistant mutant viruses.\nRationale: The paper describes the resistance selection experiments conducted with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and tenofovir (TFV).

We describe an individual with transmitted four-class\ndrug resistance whose virus sequence had the previously uncharacterized\nmutation Q148N. Infectious molecular HIV-1 clones containing Q148N alone\nand in combination with G140S demonstrated ∼2.4--4.5 reduced\nelvitegravir susceptibility depending on the virus\\'s genetic context\nbut retained susceptibility to raltegravir and dolutegravir. This level\nof reduced elvitegravir susceptibility is lower than that observed with\nQ148H/K/R and in fact the infected individual responded to an initial\ntreatment regimen containing\ntenofovir/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat. Q148N was associated\nwith a higher replication capacity than Q148H, suggesting that this\nmutation may be more fit in the absence of selective INSTI therapy.\n\n## Body \n\nA 50-year-old hispanic homosexual man underwent HIV-1 seroconversion in August 2014. His CD4 count at the time of diagnosis was 405 cells/mm3 and his plasma HIV-1 RNA level was 3,980 copies/ml. A baseline genotypic resistance test revealed the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistance mutations L210W and T215D that were interpreted as causing intermediate resistance to zidovudine and low-level resistance to tenofovir; the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-resistance mutations K101P and K103S that were interpreted as causing high-level resistance to each of the NNRTIs; and the protease inhibitor-resistance mutations D30N, L33F, I54V, N88D, and L90M that were interpreted as causing intermediate or high-level resistance to each of the PIs except darunavir. The patient was started on the once daily integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-containing fixed-dose combination tenofovir/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat.\n\nIn November 2014, the patient changed clinics and an INSTI resistance test was ordered on his August 2014 sample. The test revealed G140S, a nonpolymorphic accessory INSTI-resistance mutation, and Q148N, a previously uncharacterized mutation in the INSTI-binding pocket of integrase enzyme. At the same time, the plasma HIV-1 RNA level was <50 copies/ml and CD4 count was 767 cells/mm3. Although the patient's genotypic resistance test was reported as being associated with intermediate resistance to raltegravir and elvitegravir based on the presence of G140S, no change to therapy was made because of the patient's virological and immunological response to therapy. The patient has since been monitored closely and multiple subsequent plasma HIV-1 RNA levels have been <50 copies/ml.\n\nIn 2015, we created a panel of infectious molecular clones to assess the effect of the novel mutation Q148N on INSTI susceptibility. The panel included site-directed HIV-1 mutants containing G140S+Q148N, Q148N alone, G140S+Q148H, and Q148H alone. It also contained a recombinant infectious molecular clone from the patient's August 2014 sample and clones in which G140S alone and G140S and Q148N were independently mutated back to the wild type residues at these positions. These clones were subjected for phenotypic susceptibility testing using the PhenoSense assay (Monogram).1\n\nQ148N ± G140S was associated with 2.4- to 4.5-fold reduced susceptibility to elvitegravir but not to raltegravir or dolutegravir (Table 1). This level of INSTI resistance was lower than that observed with Q148H alone (19-fold reduced raltegravir susceptibility and 5.5-fold reduced elvitegravir susceptibility) or Q148H+G140S (>150-fold reduced susceptibility to raltegravir and elvitegravir and 3.4-fold reduced dolutegravir susceptibility). Among the site-directed mutants, Q148N had a higher replication capacity than Q148H (88% vs. 27%).\n\n## Comment\n\nQ148 is conserved in all lentiviruses and plays an essential role in\nintegrase strand transfer activity. ^2\\ ,\\ 3^ Mutations at this position\nare arguably the most important INSTI-associated resistance mutations as\nthey represent the first step in the pathway to high-level dolutegravir\ncross-resistance. ^4\\ ,\\ 5^ Of 1,120 integrase sequences from patients\nreceiving raltegravir in GenBank as of June 2015, 23%, 8%, and 1% had\nthe previously characterized INSTI-resistance mutations Q148H, Q148R,\nand Q148K, respectively. ^6^\n\nQ148N was present in viruses from three raltegravir-experienced\nindividuals and is the only other mutation at this position detected in\nGenBank sequences. ^6\\ ,\\ 7^ Q148N is also the only mutation other than\nQ148H/R/K that has been shown to have strand transfer activity in\nbiochemical assays. ^3^ There have been too few published sequences\nobtained from elvitegravir-experienced individuals to determine whether\nQ148N occurs at a higher frequency after elvitegravir treatment than\nafter raltegravir treatment. The rarity of Q148N and its weaker\nassociation with INSTI resistance suggest that it may be a revertant\nmutation arising from single nucleotide substitutions in viruses that\nonce harbored Q148H (CAC or CAT) or Q148K (AAA or AAG) = \\>Q148N (AAC or\nAAT).\n\nThe patient\\'s response to therapy may reflect the relatively low-level\nreduction in elvitegravir susceptibility associated with Q148N and the\nrelatively low plasma HIV-1 RNA level at the time of diagnosis. However,\nhad a baseline INSTI genotypic resistance test been available and had\nthe effect of Q148N been known, a different regimen would likely have\nbeen chosen.\n\nAlthough transmitted INSTI-associated resistance has been practically\nabsent in surveillance studies, ^8--10^ there have been at least three\ncase reports of INSTI-associated TDR before this one ^11--13^ . This\nreport therefore suggests that baseline INSTI genotypic resistance\ntesting may play an increasing role in the future, particularly in\npatients with transmitted resistance to other drug classes.\n\n\n## Sequence Data\n\nThe sequence of the clinical clone has been submitted to the GenBank\nunder the accession number KU761565 .\n\n\n\n## Acknowledgment\nThis study was funded in part by NIAID AI068581.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 25808007\nQuestion ID: 9\nQuestion: Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?\nEvidence: \"Integrase substitutions E92Q, Y143C, E92Q + Y143C, and Q148R conferred relatively low levels of resistance to dolutegravir in HIV-2 ~ROD9~ (2- to 6-fold), but Q148K, E92Q + N155H, T97A + N155H and G140S + Q148R resulted in moderate resistance (10- to 46-fold), and the combination of T97A + Y143C in HIV-2 ~ROD9~ conferred high-level resistance (\\>5000-fold).

Recently, WHO has emphasized the need to fast-track the transition to dolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral (ARV) treatments. However, continued surveillance of INSTI resistance is recommended. In this study, clinical, epidemiological, and virological features associated with INSTI resistance diagnosed in Spain were analyzed. Samples collected between 2008 and 2021 from HIV-1-infected patients were analyzed in integrase, protease, and reverse transcriptase using Sanger population sequencing. ARV drug resistance was evaluated with the Stanford University HIVdb program. Among 2,696 patients, 174 (6.5%) had INSTI resistance, all of them to first-generation INSTIs, and 71 (2.6%) had also resistance to second-generation INSTIs. Of these, only 5 individuals were exposed to DTG as the only INSTI, in whom resistance development was associated with poor treatment adherence and/or resistance to other ARV classes. Of newly HIV-1-diagnosed individuals, 0.92% harbored INSTI-resistant viruses, with low prevalences maintained along time, and only one had low-level resistance to DTG. Persons who inject drugs, age over 39 years, resistance to other ARV classes, and longer time from diagnosis were associated with INSTI resistance (p < 0.001). Non-subtype B INSTI-resistant viruses lacked the Q148H + G140S resistance pathway and showed lower INSTI resistance levels than subtype B viruses. In conclusion, INSTI resistance is uncommon and associated with long-term infections, older age and additional resistance to other ARV drug classes, and is rare in newly diagnosed HIV-1 infections. Our results also support the preferential use of DTG-containing regimens in first-line treatments, although surveillance of INSTI resistance is encouraged.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the analysis of drug resistance mutations and their prevalence in patient samples, but it does not mention conducting in vitro drug susceptibility tests.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 38558010\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \" Objectives:\nThe in vivo selection of E157Q plus R263K has not been reported in patients treated with coformulated bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF).

Although NNRTIs potently inhibit the\nreplication of WT HIV-1, the binding site is not conserved, and\nmutations arise in the binding pocket. Doravirine (DOR) is a new a NNRTI\nin phase III clinical trials.\n\n### Methods\n\nUsing a single round HIV-1 infection assay, we tested RPV and DOR\nagainst a broad panel of NNRTI resistant mutants to determine their\nrespective activities. We also used molecular modeling to determine if\nthe susceptibility profile of each compound was related to how they bind\nRT.\n\n### Results\n\nSeveral mutants displayed decreased susceptibility to DOR. However, with\nthe exception of E138K, our data suggest that the mutations that reduce\nthe potency of DOR and RPV are non-overlapping. Thus, these two NNRTIs\nhave the potential to be used together in combination therapy. We also\nshow that the location at which DOR and RPV bind with the NNRTI binding\npocket of RT correlates with the differences in their respective\nsusceptibility to the panel of NNRTI resistance mutations.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThis shows that (1) DOR is susceptible to a number of well-known NNRTI\nresistance mutations and (2) an understanding of the mutational\nsusceptibilities and binding interactions of NNRTIs with RT could be\nused to develop pairs of compounds with non-overlapping mutational\nsusceptibilities.\n\n\n\n## Material and Methods\n\n### NNRTI synthesis\n\nDOR synthesis is described in \\[ 16 \\]; RPV synthesis is described in \\[\n18 \\].\n\n### Cell-Based Assays\n\nVirion production and single-round infectivity assays were used to\ndetermine antiviral activity (IC ~50~ values) of the compounds as\ndescribed \\[ 19 \\] and discussed in the supplemental information .\nSelection of NNRTI mutations in HIV-1 is described in supplemental\ninformation .\n\n### Vector Constructs\n\nNNRTI resistant mutations in HIV-1 RT are described in supplemental\ninformation .\n\n### Computer Modeling\n\nAll modeling of RPV and DOR in the NNRTI binding pocket is described in\nsupplemental information .\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Antiviral activity of RPV and DOR against known NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 mutants\n\nThe ability of RPV and DOR to inhibit the replication of WT HIV-1 and\ndrug-resistant mutants was measured using a previously described\nsingle-round infection assay \\[ 19 \\]. We initially investigated the\nL100I, K103N, Y181C, Y188L, H221Y, and K103N/Y181C RT mutants. These\nmutants were chosen because they have been selected in patients and are\nwell distributed around the NNRTI binding pocket \\[ 1 , 2 \\]. In\nprevious work, RPV potently inhibited infection of both the WT and the\nmutant viruses with IC ~50~ values of 0.24 ± 0.1 nM and \\<2 nM,\nrespectively \\[ 20 \\]. DOR potently inhibited the replication of the WT\nHIV-1 vector in the single-cycle assay (0.67 ± 0.14 nM) and L100I mutant\n(1.14 ± 0.2 nM) as shown in ( Fig. 1A ). However, the resistant mutants\nK103N, Y181C, and H221Y showed modest decreases in susceptibility\nagainst DOR (ranging from 2--5 nM), and the K103N/Y181C double mutant\nexhibited a larger drop in susceptibility (11.3 ± 5.9 nM). DOR also\nshowed a considerable loss of potency versus the resistant mutant Y188L,\nout of the range of our assay (\\>100 nM).\n\nFigure 1\n\n**Antiviral activity of DOR and RPV against HIV-1 vectors that carry\nwell-known NNRTI resistance mutations**\n\n\\(A\\) The IC ~50~ values of DOR against WT HIV-1 and several\nNNRTI-resistant mutants, represented in different colors, were measured\nusing a single round infection assay. (B) The IC ~50~ values of RPV and\nDOR against WT HIV-1 and several other well-characterized NNRTI\nresistant mutants, represented in different colors, were measured using\na single round infection assay. The IC ~50~ value of DOR against the\nM230L, K103N/P225H, and V106A/G190A/F227L resistant mutants were \\>100\nnM. Error bars represent the standard deviations of independent\nexperiments, (n=4). The RPV susceptibility data were also used as a\ncontrol in experiments testing the efficacy of a series of RPV analogs\n(21).\n\n### Antiviral activities of RPV and DOR against other common NNRTI-resistant mutants\n\nWe determined the antiviral activities of RPV and DOR against some other\nknown NNRTI-resistant mutants to determine the relative strengths and\nweaknesses of the two compounds. We chose NNRTI resistant mutants that\nare known to contribute to virological failure in HIV-infected\nindividuals or mutants that were selected in cell culture: G190A, G190S,\nM230L, P236L, L100I/K103N, K103N/P225H, and V106A/G190A/F227L \\[ 7 \\].\nRPV showed potent antiviral activity against all of the tested mutants\n(\\<2 nM across the entire panel) \\[ 21 \\] whereas DOR was less effective\n( Fig. 1B ). HIV-1 variants G190A, P236L, and L100I/K103N were\nsusceptible to DOR (\\<2 nM), however the G190S mutant showed a modest\nreduction in susceptibility (4.6 ± 1.2 nM) while the M230L mutant and\nthe K103N/P225H double mutant had substantial decreases in their\nrespective susceptibilities (51.1 ± 6.5 nM and 25.3 ± 4.5 nM,\nrespectively). In addition, the triple mutant V106A/G190A/F227L was\nrelatively insensitive to DOR (\\>100 nM). These results suggest that RPV\nis more broadly effective against many NNRTI-resistant mutants.\n\n### Antiviral activities of RPV and DOR against mutants selected by DOR in cell culture\n\nV106A was the major variant selected by DOR treatment of HIV-1 in\ncultured cells \\[ 17 \\]. Some of the viruses selected by DOR in culture\ncontained additional mutations: V106A/F227L, V106A/L234I, and\nV106A/F227L/L234I \\[ 17 \\]. To determine whether there is cross\nresistance between RPV and DOR and to further compare the overall\neffectiveness of the compounds, RPV and DOR were screened against the\nfollowing mutants: V106A, L234I, V106A/F227L, V106/L234I, and\nV106A/F227L/L234I ( Fig. 2 ). All 5 of these mutants were sensitive to\nRPV (\\<0.8 nM) \\[ 21 \\]. As expected, L234I (6.8 ± 2.5 nM) showed a\nmodest reduction in susceptibility to DOR, while V106A showed a greater\nloss of susceptibility (15.6 ± 4 nM). The double and triple mutants\nV106A/F227L, V106/L234I, and V106A/F227L/L234I all showed a substantial\nloss of susceptibility to DOR (\\>100 nM).\n\nFigure 2\n\n**Antiviral activities of RPV and DOR against HIV-1 that contains\nmutations selected by DOR in cell culture**\n\nThe IC ~50~ values of RPV and DOR against vectors that carry WT RT and\nmutants selected by DOR in cell culture were measured using a\nsingle-round infection assay. Error bars represent the standard\ndeviations of independent experiments (n=4). The IC ~50~ values of the\ngraph have a maximum value of 100 nM and to better illustrate the lower\nIC ~50~ values, the Y-axis was broken twice between 1 and 5 nM and 20\nand 95 nM, there are similar breaks in the appropriate bars. The IC ~50~\nvalue of DOR against the V106A/F227L, V106A/L234I, and V106A/F227L/L234I\nresistant mutants were beyond the point of detection in our single round\ninfection assay (\\>100 nM). The RPV susceptibility data were also used\nas a control in experiments testing the efficacy of a series of RPV\nanalogs (21).\n\n### Antiviral activities of RPV and DOR against mutants selected by RPV\n\nThe E138K substitution in RT is the most common NNRTI-resistance\nmutation seen in patients who fail RPV-containing regimens \\[ 13 \\].\nBecause many of the commonly used cART regimens include either 3TC or\nFTC, some isolates from virological failures also contained the M184V/I\nmutation. K101E is a mutation that is commonly selected in patients who\nfail regimens that include ETR \\[ 11 \\], a compound that is structurally\nrelated to RPV, and that we selected with RPV *in vitro* . In addition,\nwe selected HIV-1 RT mutations in cell culture with a closely related\nRPV analog (unpublished observations): E40K, D67E, V111A, E138K, Y181C,\nand M230I. As described above, both compounds were tested against M230L\n(which should be similar to M230I). The effects of Y181C on the\nsusceptibility of the vector to DOR and RPV were discussed earlier. We\nscreened a panel of mutants that included: E40K, D67E, K101E, V111A,\nE138K, M184I, M184V, K101E/M184I, K101E/M184V, E138K/M184I, and\nE138K/M184V ( Fig. 3 ) to determine whether these mutants are\nsusceptible to DOR. DOR potently inhibited the replication of E40K,\nK101E, V111A, M184I, M184V, K101E/M184I, K101E/M184V, E138K/M184I, and\nE138K/M184V (all \\<3 nM). The E138K mutant showed a modest decrease in\nsusceptibility to DOR (13.9 ± 2.4 nM), while D67E variant showed a\nlarger decrease in susceptibility (46 ± 14 nM). Interestingly, the\nvariant K101E was the only RPV-associated single mutant which conferred\na small, but measurable decrease in susceptibility to RPV (2.6 ± 1.6\nnM), while the rest of the mutants selected by RPV remained sensitive in\nour assay (\\< 1 nM) \\[ 21 \\]. The ability of RPV to inhibit these\nE138K/M184I/V RT mutants in tissue culture has been reported previously\n\\[ 15 \\]. RPV has been reported to select for another resistance pathway\nthat involves K101P and Y181I, and K101P/V179I \\[ 13 , 17 \\]. We tested\nDOR and RPV against these resistant mutants ( Fig. 4 ); K101P HIV-1\nshowed a slight increase in susceptibility to DOR (1.0 ± 0.27 nM) and a\nmodest decrease in susceptibility to RPV (6.2 ± 1.6 nM). The Y181I\nmutant was also sensitive to DOR (0.63 ± 0.28 nM) but this mutant showed\na reduced susceptibility to RPV (8.8 ± 0.12 nM). The double mutant\nK101P/V179I showed an increase in susceptibility to DOR (1.5 ± 0.4 nM);\nhowever, this mutant had a significant loss in susceptibility to RPV\n(93.5 ± 12.1 nM) \\[ 21 \\].\n\nFigure 3\n\n**Antiviral activities of RPV and DOR against HIV-1 that contains\nmutations selected by RPV during cART and in cell culture**\n\nThe IC ~50~ values of RPV and DOR against viruses that contain WT RT and\nmutations selected by RPV in cell culture (E40K, D67E, K101E, and V111A)\nand in infected individuals during cART (K101E, E138K, M184I, M184V,\nK101E/M184I, K101E/M184V, E138K/M184I, and E138K/M184V) were measured\nusing a single-round infection assay. Error bars represent the standard\ndeviations of independent experiments (n=4). The IC ~50~ values of the\ngraph have a maximum value of 100 nM and to better illustrate the lower\nIC ~50~ values, the Y-axis was broken between 5 and 25 nM, there are\nequivalent breaks in the appropriate bar(s). The RPV susceptibility data\nwere also used as a control in experiments testing the efficacy of a\nseries of RPV analogs (21).\n\nFigure 4\n\n**Antiviral Activities of RPV and DOR against HIV-1 that contains\nadditional mutations selected by RPV in vivo**\n\nThe IC ~50~ values of RPV and DOR against viruses that contain WT RT and\nmutations selected by RPV in HIV-infected individuals were measured\nusing a single round infection assay. Error bars represent the standard\ndeviations of independent experiments (n=4). The IC ~50~ values of the\ngraph have a maximum value of 100 nM and to better illustrate the lower\nIC ~50~ values, the Y-axis was broken between 10 and 25 nM and in the\nappropriate bar. The RPV susceptibility data were also used as a control\nin experiments testing the efficacy of a series of RPV analogs (21).\n\n### Binding of RPV and DOR in the NNRTI binding pocket\n\nStructural studies can be used to understand the binding of inhibitors\nto their cognate targets; HIV-1 RT has been crystallized with RPV \\[ 22\n\\] and, more recently, with DOR \\[ 16 , 17 \\]. RPV has a pyrimidine core\nwith two aryl groups linked by amines, a benzonitrile group and\ndimethylphenyl moiety with a cyanovinyl, whereas DOR comprises a\ntrifluoromethyl-pyridone core with a methyl-triazolone and a\nchlorophenol with a cyano group. The crystal structure of RPV in the\nNNRTI binding pocket showed that the chlorophenol moiety of RPV has\naromatic stacking interactions with Y181 and the appended cyanovinyl\nextends into a hydrophobic tunnel, located in the upper portion of the\nNNRTI binding pocket, formed by the sidechains of Y188, F227, W229, and\nL234. The amine linker nitrogens interact with the main chain carbonyl\noxygens of K101 from the p66 subunit and E138 of the p51 subunit through\nhydrogen bonding. Residues L100, K103, and V179, which are located near\nthe center of the NNRTI binding pocket, interact with the central\npyrimidine ring of RPV. The benzonitrile moiety makes contacts with\nY318, P225, and P236. The interactions of DOR and the NNRTI binding\npocket of RT in the crystal structure showed that the chlorophenol\nmoiety stacks with Y188 and the DOR cyano moiety makes contacts that are\nsimilar to those made by RPV within the hydrophobic tunnel. The pyridone\ncore of DOR interacts with V106 and L100 and the methyl triazolone\nstacks with P236 and interacts with the main chain atoms of K103 \\[ 22\n\\].\n\nSuperimposing the structures of RT with DOR and RPV bound reveals\nsignificant differences in their binding ( Supp. Fig. 2 ; Fig. 5 ) and\nthe residues they contact in the binding pocket, which suggests how the\ntwo compounds differ in their susceptibility to NNRTI-resistant mutants.\nThe superimposition shows that DOR resides \\~1--2 Å deeper in the NNRTI\nbinding site compared to RPV ( Supp. Fig 2 ). In the DOR structure (\nFig. 5 , right panel B), Y188 is \\~4 Å closer to the middle and rim of\nthe binding pocket to accommodate the chlorophenol moiety of DOR, while\nY181 is \\~8 Å closer to the rim of the binding pocket compared to the\nstructure with RPV bound ( Fig. 5 , left panel A). Residue E138 moves\n\\~4.5 Å away from the rim toward the back of the NNRTI binding pocket in\nthe DOR structure as compared to the RPV structure, which prevents DOR\nfrom interacting with K101. In addition, the residues in the upper\nportion of the NNRTI binding pocket, L234, P225, and F227 are shifted by\n1.5 Å in the structure with DOR bound compared with RPV RT structure.\nThe substitution of the benzonitrile moiety of RPV with the triazolone\nof DOR causes a 2--3 Å movement of this substituent towards P236. The\ndifferences in the positions of these residues around the NNRTI binding\npocket between the two structures matches the residues where mutations\nare likely to be selected by the two compounds. It appears, based both\non the crystal structures and the behavior of the mutants in our\nantiviral assays, that residues in the upper portion of the binding\npocket interact more extensively with DOR and that the residues around\nthe rim of the binding pocket interact more with RPV. RPV is known to\nchange its binding in response to changes in the NNRTI binding pocket\nthat are associated with the presence of drug resistance mutations. We\ndo not yet have access to crystal structures of DOR bound to mutant\nforms of RT. It is possible that DOR is flexible to some extent \\[ 8 \\];\nhowever, it is more broadly susceptible to drug resistance mutations\nthan RPV.\n\nFigure 5\n\n**Relative positions of RPV and DOR in the NNRTI binding pocket, showing\ncontacts with specific residues**\n\nThe crystal structures of RPV (left image, A) and DOR (right image, B)\nare displayed for comparison to illustrate the different contacts made\nbetween the inhibitor and the NNRTI binding pocket for each. In the RPV\nstructure, the phenyl moiety of RPV stacks with Y181 (red circle), while\nE138 interacts through an electrostatic interaction with K101 (brown\ncircle) and the benzonitrile moiety stacks with Y318 (orange circle). In\nthe DOR structure, the chlorophenyl moiety of DOR alternatively stacks\nwith Y188 (blue circle), while the triazolone functionality of DOR\ninteracts with P236 (green circle), and residues E138 and Y181 (purple\ncircle) move toward the rim and back of the NNRTI binding pocket,\nrespectively. In both the RPV and DOR structures, the cyanovinyl and\ncyano functionalities, respectively, modified on the phenyl moiety\nextend in the hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains Y188, F227,\nW229, and L234. In the figure only E138K is from the RT p51 subunit in\nthe RPV (black) and DOR (magenta) images. The remaining residues are\nfrom the RT p66 subunit in the RPV (dark green) and DOR (orange)\nstructures.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nCurrent cART regimens use combinations of at least 3 drugs to fully\nsuppress HIV-1 replication. In some cases, drugs in the same class can\nbe used together if they select for non-overlapping resistance\nmutations, such as the NRTIs tenofovir and FTC \\[ 23 \\]. One issue with\nNNRTIs is their considerable cross-resistance. A new NNRTI, DOR, which\nis in phase III clinical trials, has potent antiviral activity against\nWT HIV-1 and some of the well-characterized NNRTI-resistant mutants.\nBased on analysis of the mutations in RT that were selected by DOR in\ncell culture, it was suggested that DOR and RPV select for different\nresistance mutations and that DOR could be a useful new NNRTI used in\ncART \\[ 17 \\]. However, when we analyzed a large panel of\nNNRTI-resistance mutations, we found that several well-known\nNNRTI-resistance mutations, either singly, or in combination, caused a\nconsiderable loss of DOR potency against HIV-1.\n\nThe tripartite structure of RPV is a key to its ability to inhibit a\nwide range of NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 mutants. The relatively long linker\nthat joins the cyanovinyl group to the pyrimidine scaffold (11.1 Å)\nallows the cyanovinyl group of RPV to be flexible in response to\nmutations that change the structure of the binding pocket, allowing the\ndrug to make new contacts with other residues, maintaining its ability\nto inhibit RT. Increasing the length of the linker groups that join the\nfunctional moieties to the pharmacophore is becoming a common theme in\nthe design of HIV-1 inhibitors. Dolutegravir (DTG) is an integrase\ninhibitor that has a long linker joining its benzyl moiety and\ntri-cyclic scaffold \\[ 24 , 25 \\]; this allows DTG to maintain an\ninteraction between the benzyl moiety and penultimate cytosine of the\nincoming viral DNA \\[ 24 \\]. Thus DTG is able to inhibit integration\neven when resistance mutations alter the structure of the integrase\nactive site. The distances between the pyridone scaffold of DOR and its\ncyano and triazolone moieties ( Supp. Fig. 2 ) are 7.75 Å and 6.35 Å,\nrespectively, which are considerably shorter than the linkers that join\nRPV's cyanovinyl (11.1 Å) and benzonitrile moieties (8.3 Å). This\nsuggests DOR may be more limited in its ability to adapt to the changes\nin the NNRTI binding pocket caused by some mutations and to overcome\nresistance. Importantly, classical NNRTI mutants, for example Y188L,\ncaused a substantial drop in DOR susceptibility and other classical\nNNRTI mutants including K103N and K103N/Y181C caused more modest drops\nin susceptibility to DOR. Based on the resistance data we present here,\nwe question whether DOR has significant advantages relative to the\navailable NNRTIs. However, it might be possible to develop cART regimens\nin which DOR was combined with RPV; however, as previously mentioned,\nE138K mutation could pose a problem for this combined strategy. Although\nDOR apparently did not select for the E138K mutation in cell culture, we\nfound that this mutation did reduce the susceptibility of HIV-1 to DOR\nby about 20-fold. As has already been reported, the E138K mutation does\nnot cause a significant reduction in susceptibility to RPV in cell\nculture assays (including ours). The complication is that, in\nHIV-infected individuals, RPV selects for the E138K mutation \\[ 12 , 13\n\\]. This apparent paradox has been noted before, by us \\[ 20 \\], and by\nothers \\[ 10 , 15 \\]. However, it is possible that DOR would not be\neffective in suppressing the selection and replication of E138K mutants\nthat arise during RPV-containing cART.\n\nWe superimposed the structures of HIV-1 RT with RPV or DOR to determine\nif differences in the binding of the compounds can explain the\ndifferences in their resistance susceptibility profiles. Based on the\nstructure of RPV bound to RT, it is not surprising that the K101P caused\na substantial decrease in susceptibility to RPV. K101P would appear to\ncause a steric clash with RPV in the binding pocket and the interaction\nof E138 with K101 would be lost \\[ 21 \\]. Mutating these residues likely\naffects the rates of association/dissociation of RPV within the NNRTI\nbinding pocket. The K101P/V179I mutant caused a large decrease in RPV\nsusceptibility because it affects both the contacts between the amine\nlinkers and pyrimidine core with the residues of the binding pocket by\nintroducing steric clash through the branched isoleucine and the cyclic\nproline. The Y181I mutant also displayed a decrease in susceptibility to\nRPV, unlike the other mutant at this position, Y181C, likely because of\nthe unavoidable steric clash from beta-branched isoleucine that prevents\nRPV from recruiting Y183 toward the NNRTI binding pocket to compensate\nfor the loss of interaction between Y181 and its phenyl moiety \\[ 22 \\].\nHowever, RPV did not lose efficacy against viruses with mutations in the\nupper portion of the NNRTI binding pocket (including the DOR-associated\nmutations), suggesting that residues on the rim of the NNRTI binding\npocket are much more important for the binding of RPV. Conversely, DOR\ninteracts primarily with residues in the upper portion of the NNRTI\nbinding pocket, making important contacts with K103, V106, Y188, and\nP236. Mutations at V106, with or without additional secondary mutations\n(F227L, L234I, and F227L/L234I), caused substantial decreases in\nsusceptibility to DOR. The branched, hydrophobic side chain of V106\ninteracts with the pyridone core of DOR; in the presence of the V106A\nmutation, this important contact is lost. The Y188L mutation causes the\nloss of the π-π stacking interaction, which in turn reduces the potency\nof DOR inhibition, while the lack of interaction with Y181 explains the\nfact that the Y181C and Y181I mutants are susceptible to DOR. The P236L\nmutation causes a modest decrease in DOR susceptibility by introducing\nclash and preventing the CH-π interaction between the triazolone of DOR\nand P236. Interestingly, the E138K mutant caused a 20-fold drop in\nsusceptibility to DOR. Although the E138 residue does not make any\ndirect contacts with DOR, the binding of DOR within the pocket caused\nthe position of this residue to shift substantially, which could prevent\nthe interaction between E138K of the p51 subunit and K101 of the p66\nsubunit.\n\nWe suggest that there might be advantages to a 4 drug regimen that would\ninclude one or two NRTIs or an NRTI and an integrase inhibitor, in\ncombination with 2 NNRTIs. If the NNRTIs are carefully chosen, it should\nbe difficult for the virus to develop resistance, and the low toxicity\nof the NNRTIs would be an advantage for patients \\[ 26 , 27 \\]. Whether\nDOR and RPV represent a clinically useful pair of NNRTIs that could be\nused together in cART remains to be seen; however, it would be useful to\nfind additional pairs of NNRTIs whose resistance profiles do not\noverlap. Thus there is a need to develop new NNRTIs that are broadly\neffective against known NNRTI-resistant mutants and the development of\nnew NNRTIs should make use of the available structural data, in relation\nto the resistance susceptibility profiles of the compounds, as a guide\nto develop compounds (or combinations of compounds) that can overcome\nknown NNRTI-resistant mutants.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 25385110\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: The susceptibility of subtype B mutant viruses selected by DOR, RPV, and EFV to NNRTIs was evaluated.

Isolate hypersusceptibility to ISL required F227C, in contrast to zidovudine, an NRTI, which required M184V. Mutant viruses containing each NNRTI substitution identified in the clinical trial were established, and their susceptibility to DOR was evaluated in vitro.

TAF is currently in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Phase 1 and 2 studies have shown that TAF was associated with increased peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) drug loading and increased suppression of HIV-1 replication compared to treatment with TDF. In this study, selection of in vitro resistance to both TAF and the parent compound, TFV, led to the emergence of HIV-1 with the K65R amino acid substitution in RT with 6.5-fold-reduced susceptibility to TAF. Although TAF is more potent than TFV in vitro, the antiviral susceptibilities to TAF and TFV of a large panel of nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant mutants were highly correlated (R2 = 0.97), indicating that the two compounds have virtually the same resistance profile when assessed as fold change from the wild type. TAF showed full antiviral activity in PBMCs against primary HIV-1 isolates with protease inhibitor, nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), or integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance but reduced activity against isolates with extensive NRTI resistance amino acid substitutions. However, the increased cell loading of TFV with TAF versus TDF observed in vivo suggests that TAF may retain activity against TDF-resistant mutant viruses.\nRationale: The paper describes the resistance selection experiments conducted with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and tenofovir (TFV). The study used a dose escalation method and analyzed genotypic and phenotypic changes in the virus over time.\nAnswer: Yes"}

Here, we show that the investigational compound\nMK-8591 (4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine \\[EFdA\\]) is highly\nactive against group A and B isolates of HIV-2; 50% effective\nconcentrations \\[EC ~50~ \\] for HIV-2 were, on average, 4.8-fold lower\nthan those observed for HIV-1. MK-8591 also retains potent activity\nagainst multinucleoside-resistant HIV-2 mutants (EC ~50~ ≤ 11 nM). These\ndata suggest that MK-8591 may have antiviral activity in HIV-2-infected\nindividuals.\n\n\n## TEXT\n\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART) can prolong the life spans of individuals\ninfected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by years or\neven decades, but these benefits have yet to be formally demonstrated in\nclinical trials involving human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2)\nand HIV-1/2 dually infected patients ( 1 , -- 3 ). HIV-2 is endemic in\nWest Africa and is also prevalent in other areas with socioeconomic ties\nto the region ( 4 , 5 ). Choices of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs for HIV-2\ntreatment are constrained by the intrinsic resistance of the virus to\nnon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and the reduced\nsusceptibility of HIV-2 to most HIV-1-active protease inhibitors ( 5 ,\n-- 8 ). In addition, ART-experienced HIV-2 patients frequently harbor\nmutants resistant to both protease inhibitors and NRTIs ( 9 , -- 11 ),\nand newer ARV drugs, such as integrase strand transfer inhibitors, are\nnot broadly available in areas where significant numbers of\nHIV-2-infected individuals reside. These limitations underscore the need\nto identify new ARV agents that exhibit potent activity against HIV-2,\nincluding drug-resistant strains of the virus.\n\nMK-8591 (4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine \\[EFdA\\]) ( Fig. 1 ) is\nan investigational nucleoside analog that inhibits HIV-1 replication\nwith 50% effective concentrations (EC ~50~ s) in the low\nnanomolar-to-picomolar range ( 12 , -- 16 ). Direct comparisons show\nthat MK-8591 is 10-fold more potent than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate\n(TDF) ( 15 ), 10 to100 times more potent than zidovudine (AZT) ( 12 , 14\n), and 1,000 times more potent than emtricitabine (FTC) ( 16 ) against\nHIV-1 in culture. MK-8591 also exhibits favorable pharmacokinetic\nproperties, including a long intracellular half-life compared to those\nof conventional, FDA-approved NRTIs ( 16 , -- 18 ). This property is\nattributable to the fluorine at the 2 position of the adenine base,\nwhich renders the compound resistant to degradation by adenosine\ndeaminase ( 13 , 14 ). MK-8591 suppresses HIV-1 and simian\nimmunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication at clinically achievable\nconcentrations in humanized mice and rhesus macaques, respectively ( 16\n, 19 , -- 21 ). In a phase 1b proof-of-concept clinical trial, a single\n10-mg dose of MK-8591 demonstrated antiviral activity for 10 days in\nART-naive, HIV-1-infected participants ( 22 ). The *in vivo* potency,\npharmacokinetic profile, and physical properties of MK-8591 open the\npossibility for once-weekly oral dosing, and studies of long-acting\nformulations of MK-8591 indicate that a single parenteral administration\nmay provide HIV-1-suppressive levels of the drug for 6 months or longer\n( 23 ). Thus, MK-8591 potentially represents a new ARV with multiple\nmodalities for preventing and treating HIV-1 infection.\n\nFIG 1\n\nChemical structures of 2′-deoxyadenosine (dA), MK-8591\n(4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine \\[EFdA\\]), and BMS-986001\n(2′,3′-didehydro-3′-deoxy-4′-ethynyl-thymidine; also known as\nfestinavir, censavudine, 4′-ethynyl stavudine, 4′-ethynyl-d4T, and\nOBP-601).\n\nThe exceptional antiretroviral activity of MK-8591 is likely related to\nits unique mode of action. As with FDA-approved NRTIs, MK-8591 is\nconverted to MK-8591-5′-triphosphate (MK-8591-TP) by cellular kinases\nand serves as an alternative substrate for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase\n(RT)-catalyzed DNA synthesis ( 14 , 17 , 24 , -- 26 ). However, due to\nits extendable 3′-hydroxyl group, MK-8591-TP is not an obligate chain\nterminator. Instead, incorporation of the analog results in either\nimmediate stalling of polymerization or delayed termination after\nincorporation of the next complementary nucleotide ( 26 , 27 ); the\nlatter mechanism renders the newly synthesized DNA resistant to ATP- or\npyrophosphate-mediated drug removal (excision) ( 27 ). In\npre-steady-state kinetic assays, HIV-1 RT utilized MK-8591-TP with an\nefficiency comparable to or greater than observed for dATP (depending on\nthe template sequence context), indicating that the enzyme is unable to\ndiscriminate between the two substrates ( 26 , 27 ). When insertion of\nthe analog was favored, the difference between MK-8591-TP and dATP was\nattributable to a lower *K ~d~* (dissociation constant) for the former (\n26 , 27 ), suggesting that MK-8591-TP bound to RT with a higher affinity\nthan dATP. This inference is supported by surface plasmon resonance data\n( 27 ) and by crystallographic data from the recently solved structure\nof HIV-1 RT with MK-8591-TP as the incoming nucleotide (i.e., in the N\nsite of the polymerase) ( 28 ). In this structure, the 4′-ethynyl moiety\nof the analog is embedded within a well-defined hydrophobic pocket in\nthe polymerase active site. This interaction appears to stabilize\nMK-8591-TP in the N site complex. Additional RT structures in which\nMK-8591-5′-monophosphate occupies the penultimate position of the\nnascent strand (i.e., the P site) reveal localized distortions in the\nphosphate backbone that may affect nucleic acid binding and/or\npositioning. Taken together, the pre- and postincorporation complexes (\n28 ) reveal structural features that are consistent with\nMK-8591-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 RT translocation and arrest of DNA\nsynthesis ( 27 ). To distinguish the compound from conventional\nchain-terminating NRTIs, MK-8591 is more accurately described as a\nnucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTTI).\n\nAlthough MK-8591 has been shown to potently inhibit HIV-1 and SIV in\nculture ( 12 , -- 16 , 19 ) and in experimentally infected nonhuman\nprimates and humanized mouse models ( 16 , 19 , -- 21 ), efforts to\nevaluate the activity of the drug against HIV-2 are limited; a single\nreport showed that a group B strain (HIV-2 ~EHO~ ) is sensitive to the\ndrug in spreading infections of MT-4 cells ( 14 ). In addition, the\nability of MK-8591 to inhibit HIV-2 mutants that are resistant to other\nNRTIs is unknown. In HIV-1, the M184V replacement in RT confers\nlow-level resistance to the drug (7.5- to 15-fold increase in EC ~50~ )\n( 13 , 14 ), whereas the tenofovir resistance-associated change K65R\nconfers 3- to 5-fold hypersusceptibility to MK-8591 ( 14 , 15 ).\nHowever, these findings cannot be extended *a priori* to HIV-2, as\nimportant differences exist between the two HIV types with respect to\nNRTI resistance pathways and mechanisms ( 29 , -- 31 ).\n\nWe recently evaluated the antiviral activity of a 4′-ethynyl thymidine\nanalog bearing a 2′,3′-didehydro-3′-deoxy sugar (BMS-986001; also known\nas festinavir or censavudine) ( Fig. 1 ) and found that the compound had\ngreater activity against HIV-2 than against HIV-1 in culture ( 32 ). To\nour knowledge, this remains the only report of an NRTI that, when tested\nagainst a diverse panel of HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates, exhibits\nmore-potent inhibition of HIV-2 replication. Molecular modeling suggests\nthat the ethynyl group of BMS-986001-5′-triphosphate fits within a\nhydrophobic pocket in HIV-2 RT that corresponds to the aforementioned 4′\npocket of the HIV-1 enzyme ( 28 , 32 ). In agreement with this model,\nother 4′-modified nucleosides with 2′-deoxy ( 14 , 33 ) and\n2′-deoxy-2′-β-fluoro ( 34 ) sugar configurations also inhibit HIV-2\nreplication, with EC ~50~ s in the nanomolar range. Collectively, these\nfindings suggest that MK-8591 might inhibit a broad range of HIV-2\nisolates with a potency comparable to or even better than that observed\nfor HIV-1.\n\nIn the present study, we tested the activity of MK-8591 against a panel\nof HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains that were originally isolated from ART-naive\nindividuals. We also evaluated the ability of MK-8591 to inhibit HIV-2\nvariants with mutations in RT that emerge in response to ART ( 9 , 10 ,\n35 , -- 49 ) and that confer resistance to various NRTIs in culture ( 29\n, 40 , 50 , -- 52 ) and in biochemical assays with purified HIV-2 RT (\n30 , 31 ). Unless otherwise specified, drug susceptibility measurements\nwere performed using MAGIC-5A indicator cells, which are CD4 ^+^ CXCR4\n^+^ CCR5 ^+^ HeLa cells containing an HIV-inducible reporter gene (HIV\nlong terminal repeat \\[LTR\\]--β-galactosidase). A detailed description\nof the assay protocol has been provided elsewhere ( 32 ). Importantly,\nthis methodology directly quantifies antiviral activity in a single\nround of HIV infection (as opposed to measuring virus-induced cell death\nor viral protein release following multiple rounds of HIV replication),\nand the resultant EC ~50~ s are not affected by strain-specific\ndifferences in replication rate, infectivity, cytopathic potential, or\ncell-to-cell spread ( 32 , 53 , 54 ). The 50% cytotoxic concentration\n(CC ~50~ ) for MK-8591 in MAGIC-5A cells was \\>100 nM, as determined\nusing the CellTiter Glo assay (Promega) ( 32 ).\n\nWe initially compared the ability of MK-8591 to inhibit two prototypic\nisolates derived from full-length plasmid molecular clones: HIV-1\n~NL4-3~ and HIV-2 ~ROD9~ . We have previously shown that these isolates\nexhibit comparable susceptibilities to FDA-approved NRTIs in the\nMAGIC-5A cell line, with EC ~50~ s that differ by 2-fold or less between\nthe two strains ( 53 ). In the present study, we performed a total of 10\nindependent assay runs in which the sensitivity of HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ and\nHIV-2 ~ROD9~ to MK-8591 was tested head-to-head (e.g., Fig. 2A ). In\nthese experiments, the mean EC ~50~ for HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ was 2.0 ± 0.6 nM.\nThis result agrees with previously published measurements for HIV-1 in\nsingle-cycle assays (1.1 nM for HIV-1 ~BH10~ in MAGI cells \\[ 14 \\], 3.2\nnM for HIV-1 ~NL101~ in TZM-bl cells \\[ 15 \\]). In contrast, within each\nassay run, the EC ~50~ for HIV-2 ~ROD9~ was lower than the corresponding\nvalue for HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ by a factor of 2.3 to 9.9 ( Fig. 2A and ​ andB).\nB ). Following additional determinations ( *n* = 14 total), the mean EC\n~50~ for HIV-2 ~ROD9~ was 0.42 ± 0.12 nM ( Fig. 3A ). Thus, MK-8591 was\n4.8-fold more active against HIV-2 ~ROD9~ than against HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ in\nthe single-cycle assay. These data are concordant with the results of\nspreading infection assays with CEMss cells (see reference \\[ 32 \\] for\nthe assay protocol), which yielded EC ~50~ s of 38 pM for HIV-2 ~ROD9~\nand 120 pM for HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ .\n\nFIG 2\n\nAntiviral activity of MK-8591 against HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ and HIV-2 ~ROD9~ .\n(A) Representative data from a single run of the drug susceptibility\nassay in MAGIC-5A cells (single-cycle assay) ( 32 ).

In panels B\nand C, the horizontal lines are the means from the respective data\ngroups; *P* values are the results of Welch\\'s *t* tests.\n\nOther HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates from ART-naive individuals showed a\nsimilar trend with respect to MK-8591 susceptibility in the single-cycle\nassay ( Fig. 3A ). The mean EC ~50~ for 10 HIV-1 strains from groups M\nand O was 2.6 ± 0.6 nM (range = 2.0 to 3.8 nM), whereas HIV-2 isolates\nfrom groups A and B yielded EC ~50~ s of 0.55 ± 0.17 nM and 0.50 ± 0.12\nnM, respectively (range = 0.25 to 0.76 nM) ( Fig. 3A and ​ andC). C ).\nOverall, HIV-2 was more susceptible to MK-8591 than HIV-1 was by a\ndifference of 4.8-fold ( Fig. 3B ).\n\nTo identify structural features that might explain the increased\nactivity of MK-8591 against HIV-2, we constructed a molecular model of\nHIV-2 RT with MK-8591-TP bound at the polymerase active site and\ncompared the model to the published structure of the HIV-1\nRT--MK-8591-TP complex ( 28 ) (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental\nmaterial). This model recapitulates important features of the HIV-1\nstructure, including base-pairing interactions between MK-8591-TP and\nthe template thymidine, coordination of the triphosphate by magnesium,\nand the presence of a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the\n4′-ethynyl moiety of the inhibitor. However, closer inspection of the\ntwo structures suggests that subtle differences in the positioning of\nresidues A114, Y115, F160, M184, and D185 result in a wider 4′ pocket in\nHIV-2 RT than in the HIV-1/MK-8591-TP complex (see Fig. S1 in the\nsupplemental material). A similar disparity in the sizes of the 4′\npockets is evident in our models of HIV-1 and HIV-2 RT with\nBMS-986001-5′-triphosphate as the incoming substrate ( 32 ). Whether\nthis variation accounts for the differential sensitivities of HIV-1 and\nHIV-2 to MK-8591 is unclear and will likely remain uncertain until a\ncrystal structure of the HIV-2/MK-8591-TP complex is obtained.\n\nMutations that are associated with NRTI treatment can have differing\neffects on drug susceptibility/resistance in HIV-1 versus HIV-2, as\ndemonstrated for thymidine analog mutations and for the Q151M\nreplacement in RT ( 29 , -- 31 ). We therefore examined the resistance\nprofile of MK-8591 using a panel of site-directed HIV-2 ~ROD9~ RT\nmutants and a recombinant clone of HIV-2 (designated 4.7a) that was\nderived from a patient receiving AZT, lamivudine (3TC), and\nritonavir-boosted lopinavir; this clone encodes five amino acid\nsubstitutions that are associated with ART in HIV-2-infected individuals\n(RT changes K65R, N69S, V111I, Q151M, and M184V; see reference \\[ 32 \\]\nfor treatment history, clone construction, and additional details). A\nsite-directed mutant of HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ encoding the M184V replacement was\nincluded in this analysis as an MK-8591-resistant control ( 14 ).\n\nRelative to the parental clone, the K65R mutant of HIV-2 ~ROD9~ was\nhypersusceptible to MK-8591, with a mean EC ~50~ that was 2.5-fold lower\nthan the value for the wild-type virus; the K65R+Q151M HIV-2 ~ROD9~\nmutant was also hypersusceptible to MK-8591 (2.1-fold) ( Table 1 ).\nMK-8591 was fully active against Q151M HIV-2 ~ROD9~ , whereas the M184V\nchange conferred 26-fold resistance to the drug. A slightly lower level\nof resistance (9-fold) was observed for M184V HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ ( Table 1 ).\nIn contrast, in both HIV-1 and HIV-2, the M184V replacement confers\n\\>1,000-fold resistance to FTC and 3TC ( 50 , 51 , 55 ). Overall, the\nchanges in MK-8591 susceptibility that resulted from single amino acid\nchanges K65R, Q151M, and M184V in HIV-2 ~ROD9~ were similar to those\nreported for HIV-1 ( 13 , -- 15 ).\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nApproval for collection of data and patient samples for this study was obtained from the UW Institutional Review Board and Senegal ethics committee.\n\nThese studies were supported by grants to G.S.G. from the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH/NIAID) (grants 1R01-AI120765 and 2R01-AI060466), the UW Center for AIDS Research (CFAR, an NIH-funded program) (grant P30 AI027757), and the UW Royalty Research Fund (grant A92723).

Although the primary H51Y substitution did not confer resistance against DTG or RAL (FC values of 1.25 and 0.98, respectively), consistent with previous results ( 11 ), the addition of R262K did result in low-level but significant biochemical resistance to DTG but not to RAL (FC values of 1.9 and 0.92, respectively).\"\nRationale: The paper includes in vitro drug susceptibility data, specifically examining the susceptibility of HIV-1 to dolutegravir (DTG) and raltegravir (RAL) using short-term resistance assays with TZM-bl cells.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 25808007\nQuestion ID: 13\nQuestion: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\nEvidence: In vitro activity of dolutegravir against wild-type and integrase inhibitor-resistant HIV-2.

TAF is currently in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Phase 1 and 2 studies have shown that TAF was associated with increased peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) drug loading and increased suppression of HIV-1 replication compared to treatment with TDF. In this study, selection of in vitro resistance to both TAF and the parent compound, TFV, led to the emergence of HIV-1 with the K65R amino acid substitution in RT with 6.5-fold-reduced susceptibility to TAF. Although TAF is more potent than TFV in vitro, the antiviral susceptibilities to TAF and TFV of a large panel of nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant mutants were highly correlated (R2 = 0.97), indicating that the two compounds have virtually the same resistance profile when assessed as fold change from the wild type. TAF showed full antiviral activity in PBMCs against primary HIV-1 isolates with protease inhibitor, nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), or integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance but reduced activity against isolates with extensive NRTI resistance amino acid substitutions. However, the increased cell loading of TFV with TAF versus TDF observed in vivo suggests that TAF may retain activity against TDF-resistant mutant viruses.\nRationale: These sentences describe the use of a panel of recombinant isolates to study the suscptibility of viruses with known sequences.

Dolutegravir is reported to be effective\nagainst viruses resistant to raltegravir and elvitegravir. In this\nstudy, we report the case of a patient treated with dolutegravir\nmonotherapy. Failure of dolutegravir treatment was observed concomitant\nwith the appearance of N155H-K211R-E212T mutations in the integrase (IN)\ngene in addition to the polymorphic K156N mutation that was present at\nbaseline in this patient.\n\nMethods\n\nThe impact of N155H-K156N-K211R-E212T mutations was studied in\ncell-free, culture-based assays and by molecular modelling.\n\nResults\n\nCell-free and culture-based assays confirm that selected mutations in\nthe patient, in the context of the polymorphic mutation K156N present at\nthe baseline, lead to high resistance to dolutegravir requiring that the\nanalysis be done at timepoints longer than usual to properly reveal the\nresults. Interestingly, the association of only N155H and K156N is\nsufficient for significant resistance to dolutegravir. Modelling studies\nshowed that dolutegravir is less stable in IN/DNA complexes with respect\nto the WT sequence.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur results indicate that the stability of STI IN/DNA complexes is an\nimportant parameter that must be taken into account when evaluating\ndolutegravir resistance. This study confirms that a pathway including\nN155H can be selected in patients treated with dolutegravir with the\nhelp of the polymorphic K156N that acts as a secondary mutation that\nenhances the resistance to dolutegravir.\n\n\n## Patients and methods\n\n### Ethics\n\nInformation was obtained from the existing electronic database or\nmedical records. Patients were informed that their demographic and\nclinical data would be recorded during their follow-up and their blood\nsamples would be stored and could be used for retrospective studies and\nthey gave their consent.\n\n### Cells and viruses\n\n293-T and HeLa-P4 cells were cultured in DMEM and MT4 cells were\ncultured in RPMI-1640 and maintained at 37°C and 5% CO ~2~ . The media\nwere supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. HIV-1 IN mutants were\nobtained by site-directed mutagenesis as previously described. ^13^\nHIV-1 stocks were prepared by 293-T cell transfections and HIV-1 p24\n^gag^ antigen was quantified as previously described. ^13^\n\n### HIV infectivity assay\n\nSingle-cycle titres of the virus were determined on HeLa-P4 cells as\npreviously described. ^13^ Cells were infected in 96-well plates (3 ng\nof p24 ^gag^ antigen) with or without raltegravir or dolutegravir. Viral\ntitre was determined by quantifying β-galactosidase activity in HeLa-P4\nlysates using a colorimetric assay. The 50% effective concentration (EC\n~50~ ) was defined as the drug concentration resulting in\nβ-galactosidase levels that were 50% lower than those in infected cells\nwithout the drug.\n\n### Virus infections\n\nInfections were performed on MT4 cells (2 × 10 ^6^ cells/mL with 20 ng\nof p24 ^gag^ antigen per 10 ^6^ cells) with or without drugs. Four hours\npost-infection, cells were washed in PBS and new medium was added. At\nvarious times post-infection, 1--2 million cells were harvested and dry\npellets were frozen at --80°C.\n\n### DNA extraction and quantitative PCR\n\nTotal DNA from the previously described dry pellets was extracted using\nthe QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Quantifications of viral DNA\nforms (total viral DNA and integrated viral DNA) were performed by\nreal-time PCR on a LightCycler instrument using the FastStart DNA Master\nHybProbe kit (Roche Diagnostics) as previously described. ^16^\n\n### Characterization of integrase enzymatic activity in cell-free reactions\n\nRecombinant IN was purified under non-denaturing conditions, as\npreviously described. ^17^ The susceptibility of IN to raltegravir and\ndolutegravir was determined in cell-free reactions by assessing IN\nactivity in the presence of various concentrations of INSTIs using\nradiolabelled oligonucleotides U5B and U5B-2 mimicking the unprocessed\nand 3′-processed viral ends, respectively, as previously described. ^13^\nIC ~50~ values were determined with Prism 5.0 software.\n\n### Docking and molecular dynamics simulations of dolutegravir against IN mutated complexes\n\nSince it has proven difficult to crystallize the full-length HIV\nintegrase and its complex with DNA and inhibitors, experimental\nstructures derived from a related retrovirus, the prototype foamy virus\n(PFV), are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (\nhttps://www.rcsb.org ). Thus, for the computational analysis we used the\ncrystal structures of WT and N224H (mimicking the N155H in HIV-1)\nmutated PFV intasome, in complex with Mg ^2+^ and dolutegravir,\ndeposited with PDB codes 3S3M and 3S3O, respectively. ^18^ We used the\nPFV IN model owing to the high level of conservation between INs. ^19^\n^,^ ^20^ The mutations N224H, S225N, N280R and Q281T of the PFV IN\nsequence correspond to N155H, K156N, K211R and E212T in the HIV-1 IN\nsequence, respectively.\n\nThe mutated models were generated by single-residue replacement and the\nobtained structures were prepared using Maestro tools (software:\nMaestro, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2017). For each complex, 10 000\nMacroModel minimization steps were carried out using OPLS_2005 as a\nforce field (software: MacroModel, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY,\n2017). Docking studies were performed by means of the Induced Fit\ndocking protocol using the Standard protocol and generating 20 poses for\nligand. In the re-docking step the XP Glide algorithm was applied\n(software: Induced Fit docking protocol, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY,\n2017). For each complex, the best docking pose, selected according to\nthe GlideScore function, was submitted to Molecular Dynamics simulations\n(MDs). To analyse the dolutegravir thermodynamic profile, we calculated\nthe ΔEmodel, expressed in kcal/mol, thus obtaining the difference in\nEmodel values between the WT sequence and the mutated complexes. The\nEmodel value has a more significant weighting of the force field\ncomponents, which makes it well-suited to compare conformers and it is\nhelpful to select the best-docked structure for each complex. Then, for\neach complex we submitted the best docking pose to 100 ns of MDs using\nthe Desmond package v. 3.8 at a temperature of 300 K (software: Desmond\nMolecular Dynamics System, D.E. Shaw Research, New York, NY, 2017). The\nsystem was solvated in an orthorhombic box with a buffer of 10 Å, using\nTIP3P (transferable intermolecular potential with 3 points) water\nmolecules as the solvent model, and counter ions were added to\nneutralize the system charge. To investigate the behaviour of\ndolutegravir during all trajectories, the ligand root mean square\ndeviations (RMSD) with respect to the protein and its binding pocket\nwere calculated. With a view to assess the occupancy and to appreciate\nthe shift of dolutegravir from the IN binding site, we monitored the\ndistance between the metal-chelating core of the drug and the\n3′-deoxyadenosine of the viral DNA.\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Identification of N155H, K156N, K211R and E212T mutations in a patient failing dolutegravir treatment\n\nThe patient infected with a B subtype HIV-1 strain received an\nantiretroviral treatment including INSTIs from 2008 to 2015, a period\nduring which CD4 counts had increased from 350 to 940 cells/mm ^3^ . The\npatient was first treated with raltegravir in combination with\ntenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada) for 6 years until 2014, during which\ntime the viral load remained undetectable (plasma HIV RNA \\<20\ncopies/mL). Every 6 months, during follow-up, genotypic analysis of\nintegrase was tested in DNA and never showed any mutations selected\nagainst raltegravir. Owing to treatment intolerance, a simplification of\ntreatment with dolutegravir monotherapy (not currently recommended in\nany guidelines for HIV-1 treatment) was proposed to the patient in 2014\nwhile the viral load was still undetectable.\n\nFive months later, the viral load became detectable in plasma at 291\ncopies/mL. Integrase genotypic analysis was performed on DNA from PBMCs,\nwhen the plasma viral load was below 20 copies/mL and on plasma RNA when\nit was detectable above 20 copies/mL. Genotypic analysis before 2014\nidentified no resistance mutations, but a polymorphism was highlighted\nat position 156 with a K156N present throughout the study. Three weeks\nafter the beginning of the dolutegravir monotherapy, a mixture of amino\nacid sequences appeared in the DNA at both positions 211 and 212,\nK211K/R (AAA/AGA codons) and E212E/A (GAA/GCA). Plasma RNA genotyping,\n5 months after the start of dolutegravir monotherapy, confirmed the\nexistence of the K211R (AGA) mutation at position 211, while at position\n212 genotyping revealed an additional nucleotide mutation (GCA to ACA)\nleading to E212T instead of E212A. At the same time, N155H was also\nidentified (Table 1 ).\n\n### Characterization of the mutations with cell-free and cell-based assays\n\nWe first investigated the replicative properties of mutant viruses. The\np24 ^gag^ production of these mutants was similar to the WT showing that\nnone of these mutations impaired the late steps of viral replication\n(Figure 1 a, left panel and black columns). The early steps of HIV-1\nreplication were investigated by HeLa-P4 cell infection (Figure 1 a,\nleft panel and grey columns). Interestingly, infectivity of the mutants\nwas similar to the WT indicating that mutations identified in the\npatient do not impair the early steps of viral replication. The\nabove-mentioned mutations could affect the 3′-processing and/or the\nstrand-transfer reaction mediated by IN. Our cell-free reaction results\ndemonstrate that the 3′-processing efficiency for all mutants was\nsimilar but significantly lower compared with the WT (an average of 50%\nof the WT, Figure 1 a middle panel and black columns). However, the\nstrand-transfer efficiency was not affected by any mutations (Figure 1\na, middle panel and grey columns). Thus, all the mutations presented in\nthis report slightly impair the 3′-processing but not the\nstrand-transfer reaction. We performed resistance experiments using a\n19-mer DNA (U5B-2) mimicking the 3′-processed DNA. The incubation for\n2 h at 37°C, usually used, failed to reveal significant resistance to\ndolutegravir for any of the mutants (Figure 1 a, right panel).\n\nFigure 1.\n\nCharacterization of viral infectivity and strand-transfer inhibitors of\nIN mutants in the virological context and in cell-free reactions.

Middle panel, 3′-processing activity using the unprocessed\noligonucleotide (U5B; black columns). Strand-transfer activity using the\npre-processed oligonucleotide (U5B-2; grey columns).

The\ngraph presented is a representative experiment from three independent\nexperiments, \\* *P* \\< 0.05. RAL, raltegravir; DTG, dolutegravir.\n\nOpen in new tab Download slide\n\nThen, we determined the EC ~50~ of each mutant by infecting HeLa-P4\ncells in the presence of increasing concentrations of raltegravir and\ndolutegravir (Figure 1 b). In the case of raltegravir, the K211R/E212T\nmutations do not confer resistance to raltegravir. This association of\nK211R/E212T mutations with N155H or N155H/K156N mutations does not\ninfluence their resistance to raltegravir since the N155H, N155H/K156N,\nN155H/K211R/E212T and N155H/K156N/K211R/E212T mutants display similar\nresistance to raltegravir (EC ~50~ between 24.5 and 54 nM). Regarding\nthe dolutegravir experiment (Figure 1 b, left panel), our results do not\nhighlight a significant resistance to dolutegravir for any of the\nviruses studied with EC ~50~ values equal to 1.4 and 1.5 nM for the WT\nand the K211R/E212T mutant respectively and between 1.2 and 1.6 nM for\nother mutants.\n\n### Mutations described in the patient confer dolutegravir resistance in cell-free reactions in a time-dependent manner\n\nHightower and colleagues have shown that dissociation of dolutegravir\nfrom the IN--DNA complex was slower compared with raltegravir and\nelvitegravir whichever integrase mutations were tested. ^21^ We\nincreased the incubation time of the strand-transfer reaction from 2 h\nto 48 h to evaluate its impact on the dolutegravir effect. Increasing\nthe incubation time up to 48 h did not influence the IC ~50~ of\ndolutegravir for the WT (8 nM) highlighting the strong stability of the\ncompound in the IN--DNA complex (Figure 2 a and b). Interestingly, we\nfound a significant increase in the IC ~50~ as a function of time for\nall mutants (Figure 2 b). First, a significant IC ~50~ increase for the\nN155H mutant (from 8 nM for 2 h of incubation to 24 nM for 48 h of\nincubation) highlighted that the N155H mutation confers significant\nresistance to dolutegravir compared with the WT (Figure 2 b). Second,\nthere was an increase in the IC ~50~ for the N155H/K211R/E212T mutant\n(from 16 nM for 2 h of incubation to 32 nM for 48 h of incubation) and a\nmore important increase for the N155H/K156N/K211R/E212T mutant (from\n20 nM for 2 h of incubation to 120 nM for 48 h of incubation). These\nresults clearly show that mutations described in the patient, even the\nN155H mutation alone, provide resistance to dolutegravir when analysed\nin a longer timescale.\n\nFigure 2.\n\nResistance to dolutegravir as a function of time.

DTG, dolutegravir.\n\nOpen in new tab Download slide\n\n### Mutations also confer dolutegravir resistance in a time-dependent manner in the virological context\n\nAs previously shown, dolutegravir resistance could not be highlighted by\nclassic β-galactosidase (CPRG) assays; thus, in order to introduce the\nfactor time, we used a pNL4.3 backbone encoding GFP under the control of\n5′-LTR. ^22^ This viral construction allows a single round of infection\nand leads to high expression of GFP upon integration. Importantly, weak\nexpression of GFP can be detected in unintegrated viral DNA. After\ninfection of MT4 cells with both constructions (WT and\nN155H/K156N/K211R/E212T) a similar percentage of GFP-positive cells was\nreached, indicating that these mutations do not influence reverse\ntranscription. Furthermore, flow cytometry analyses demonstrated that\nintegration was not impaired by N155H/K156N/K211R/E212T mutations since\nthe percentage of M2-positive cells at day 3 post-infection (cells\nexpressing a high amount of GFP from integrated viral DNA) was quite\nsimilar (65% and 68% of the GFP-positive cells for\nN155H/K156N/K211R/E212T and WT viruses, respectively) (Figure 3 a).\nThen, from day 3 to day 7 post-infection, the percentage of M2 cells\ndecreased in the same way for both viruses (from 65% or 68% to 37%).\nThis decrease is explained by silencing of the 5′-LTR containing the\npromoter responsible for GFP expression (Figure 3 a). The same\nexperiment was performed with dolutegravir (25 nM), added concomitantly\nwith the viruses (Figure 3 b). As previously shown with CPRG assays\n(Figure 1 d), dolutegravir efficiently inhibits integration of both\nviruses as the percentage of M2 cells decreases from 68% to 4%, without\nor with dolutegravir, respectively (compare Figure 3 a and b). We\nobserved a continuous decrease in the percentage of M2 cells for the WT\nvirus (from 4% at day 3 to 1.5% at day 7); however, the\nN155H/K156N/K211R/E212T virus showed an increase in M2 cells reaching a\nmaximum at day 5, this increase being a consequence of greater\nintegration since integrated DNA is the only template for such\nexpression. ^22^ These data demonstrate that even if dolutegravir\nefficiently inhibits the WT virus as well as the N155H/K156N/K211R/E212T\nmutant, this inhibition is only transient for the mutant virus showing\nthat this virus displays a time-dependent susceptibility to\ndolutegravir.\n\nFigure 3.\n\nResistance to dolutegravir in the virological context using single-round\ninfection. MT4 cells were infected using the WT and\nN155H/K156N/K211R/E212T viruses without or in the presence of 25 nM\ndolutegravir (panel a and b, respectively). GFP expression due to\nintegrated viral DNA (M2 population) was quantified from day 3 to day 7\npost-infection. Data shown are means ± SD (error bars) of three\nindependent experiments, \\* *P* \\< 0.05. DTG, dolutegravir.\n\nOpen in new tab Download slide\n\n### Impact of mutations on the viral DNA forms during replication\n\nFurther experiments were performed on MT4 cells with WT and mutant\nviruses N155H, N155H/K156N and N155H/K156N/K211R/E212T with or without\ndolutegravir (25 nM). Dolutegravir was added at the time of infection\nand then cells were regularly diluted in fresh medium. Total and\nintegrated viral DNA were quantified as previously reported (Figure 4 ).\n^23^ For IN mutants we observed, with dolutegravir, an increase in total\nviral DNA as well as integrated viral DNA whereas they both declined for\nthe WT infection, integrated viral DNA becoming undetectable after four\ndays post-infection showing the ability of dolutegravir to inhibit the\nspread of the WT virus (Figure 4 a and b). For mutants, increased\nintegrated DNA is directly correlated with the number of mutations\n(Figure 4 b). Our results demonstrate that, in these settings,\ndolutegravir can efficiently inhibit the WT virus but, more importantly,\ndolutegravir does not inhibit the replication of the viruses harbouring\nmutations in a long-term manner.\n\nFigure 4.\n\nViral DNA monitored by quantitative PCR. MT4 cells were infected with WT\nand IN mutant viruses with or without dolutegravir (100 nM). Total viral\nDNA and integrated viral DNA were quantified during the course of the\nexperiment.

For all the mutated\ncomplexes, our structural analysis revealed that the dolutegravir\nenergetic profile was unfavourable compared with that of the WT (Figure\n5 ). We noticed that in the presence of the N224H mutation (mimicking\nHIV-1 N155H), N224H-S225N mutations (mimicking HIV-1 N155H and K156N)\nand N224H-S225N-N280R-Q281T mutations (mimicking HIV-1\nN155H-K156N-K211R-E212T), dolutegravir showed a lower theoretical\nbinding affinity against IN with respect to that of the WT sequence\n(Table 2 ). In the WT complex, dolutegravir was involved in two stacking\ninteractions, the first one between its 2, 4-difluorobenzyl ring and\ncytosine C16 from the C/G base pair of viral DNA and the second one\nbetween the metal-chelating core of the drug and the viral\n3′-deoxyadenosine. In all mutated complexes, the dolutegravir 2,\n4-difluorobenzyl ring was the only moiety able to maintain the stacking\ninteraction with viral DNA cytosine C16 (Figure 6 ).\n\nFigure 5.\n\nDolutegravir thermodynamic profile in the presence of the mutated\ncomplexes of HIV-1 IN. The bars indicate the ΔEmodel (Emodel ~MUT~\n--Emodel ~WT~ ) variations, between the WT sequence and N224H (mimicking\nN155H in HIV-1 IN), N224H-S225N (mimicking N155H-K156N in HIV-1 IN) and\nN224H-S225N-N280R-Q281T (mimicking N155H-K156N-K211R-E212T in HIV-1 IN)\nmutants.

As\nshown in Figure 7 a and Table 2 , in the WT complex the drug remained\nstable during all the simulation. By contrast, for the N224H mutated\ncomplex, we noticed that dolutegravir slightly decreased its stability\nwith respect to the WT trend. In the presence of the double N224H-S225N\nand the quadruple N224H-S225N-N280R-Q281T mutants, we observed reduced\nstability of dolutegravir with respect to both the WT and the single\nmutated complex.\n\nFigure 7.\n\nDolutegravir RMSD distance trend and plot of the distance (Å),\ncalculated between the metal-chelating core of dolutegravir and the\n3′-deoxyadenosine of the viral DNA as a measure of the shift of the\nligand from the binding site.

Indeed, we showed that the\naverage distance between dolutegravir and the 3′-deoxyadenosine of DNA\nduring the whole MDs increased for N224H, N224H-S225N and\nN224H-S225N-N280R-Q281T structures with respect to that of the WT (Table\n2 ). We noticed that the distance between the dolutegravir\nmetal-chelating core and the 3′-deoxyadenosine of the viral DNA for the\nquadruple mutant complex was smaller with respect to that of the double\nmutant; this is probably due to a more favourable electrostatic\ninteraction between the arginine280 and the phosphate groups of the\nviral DNA, thus justifying an increased stability trend for the\nN224H-S225N-N280R-Q281T mutated complex (Figure 7 b).\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nCurrently, specific dolutegravir resistance pathways have not yet been\nclearly identified, but the VIKING trials show that dolutegravir is\nefficient against most of the viral strains resistant to raltegravir and\nelvitegravir, particularly regarding the N155H mutation, but confers\nslight resistance when the Q148 residue is associated with secondary\nmutations. ^24--26^ Recently, we reported that a combination of\nmutations belonging to pathways Q148 and N155, each leading to\nraltegravir resistance, made it possible to develop high levels of\nresistance to dolutegravir. ^12^\n\nIn this report, four mutations have been studied regarding their\nparticipation in dolutegravir resistance. Firstly, the classical\napproach using HeLa-P4 cells showed that HIV-1 isolates involving\nmutations at the N155, K156, K211 and E212 amino acids do not show any\nresistance to dolutegravir whereas mutants involving the N155H mutation\nconventionally showed resistance to raltegravir (Figure 1 b). Cell-free\nreaction studies of the strand-transfer step showed that an increase in\nincubation time led to dolutegravir resistance, whereas the classical\nincubation time of 2 h did not distinguish mutants from the WT. Also, in\na virological context, we demonstrated that inhibition by dolutegravir\nwas only transient for the N155H-K156N-K211R-E212T mutant unlike the WT\nvirus. These results could be consistent with observations made by\nHightower and colleagues showing that dolutegravir harboured slower\ndissociation rates on mutated IN--DNA complexes harbouring the N155H\nmutation compared with raltegravir. ^21^ All these data show that N155H\nmutation confers some resistance to dolutegravir that is increased in a\nconsistent way when K211R/E212T and K156N mutations are added. From a\nclinical point of view, two patients receiving dolutegravir have already\nbeen reported with an emerging N155H mutation reinforcing the idea that\nselection of this mutation could be responsible for resistance to\ndolutegravir. ^27^ Regarding the K156N polymorphic mutation detected at\na frequency of about 10%, ^28^ it could play a key role in the selection\nof N155H mainly owing to its impact on IC ~50~ measurement when\nassociated with N155H. For this reason, it would be interesting to know\nthe genetic profile of integrase in the two patients described above. In\naddition, a report suggests the importance of K156N as a secondary\nmutation of resistance to raltegravir ^28^ ; also, residue K156 is\ndescribed as involved in the interactions between IN and the viral DNA\nends. ^29^ As a result, K156N could play an important role in the\nselection of a virus resistant to dolutegravir.\n\nWe explained the apparent discrepancy between classical CPRG assays and\ncell-free experiments involving an increase in reaction time by the\nstability of dolutegravir on IN--DNA complexes and the time needed to\nproperly reveal the results of the experiment. These hypotheses are\nreinforced by *in silico* studies that show that when mutations are\npresent in IN, dolutegravir is less stable on the pre-integration\ncomplex depending on the number of mutations, probably due to the loss\nof one pivotal stacking interaction with the viral 3′-deoxyadenosine\n(A17) and the associated drug shift from the catalytic binding site, as\nhighlighted by MDs, especially in the double N155H-K156N and the\nquadruple N155H-K156N-K211R-E212T mutants. These observations are\ncompletely in agreement with the role of 3′-deoxyadenosine in the\nstabilization and in the control of the kinetics of binding and\ndissociation of the INSTIs. ^19^ ^,^ ^30^ According to the experimental\ndata, our computational protocol could explain the resistance and the\ninability of the drug to block the enzyme activity in the presence of\nthe analysed mutations, as shown by the disadvantaged energetic profile\nof dolutegravir and the loss of pivotal stacking interaction between the\nmetal-chelating core of the drug and the adenine (A17) of the viral DNA,\nin the presence of the mutated complexes.\n\nThe results discussed here reveal that the stability of dolutegravir on\nthe pre-integration complexes appears to be an important parameter that\nobviously contributes to its efficiency and could explain data obtained\nfrom the clinic in some patients failing dolutegravir treatment.\nTogether, our results strongly suggest that the polymorphic mutation\nK156N could play a role in the selection of the N155H mutation leading\nto dolutegravir resistance. In this sense, it would be important to\ncarefully explore the presence of this mutation in patients in whom\ndolutegravir therapy is failing in order to evaluate its involvement in\ndolutegravir resistance.\n\n\n### Funding\n\nThis work was supported by the Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le\nSIDA et les Hépatites Virales (ANRS), A02011-01.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 27084918\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: The E157Q virus was hypersusceptible to dolutegravir, displaying an IC ~50~ of 0.43 nM, which was 100-fold lower than WT (52.1 nM). The combination of E157Q and R263K increased dolutegravir resistance by 20- and 10-fold compared with the WT and R263K enzymes, respectively. We also investigated the effects of E157Q on IN DNA binding activity and susceptibility to a DNA binding inhibitor in tissue culture, in part because we recently identified Glu157 as a putative interaction domain with the HIV IN DNA binding inhibitor FZ41\nRationale: The paper includes data on the susceptibility of various HIV-1 mutants to different integrase inhibitors, including dolutegravir and raltegravir, indicating that in vitro drug susceptibility data was reported.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 25414202\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Both the F121Y and G118R mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the pNL4.3 backbone and studied in cell-based and in vitro assays. The effects of the mutations were characterized at the different steps of infection by quantitative PCR. Results obtained with in vitro and ex vivo assays consistently showed that both mutations impaired the catalytic properties of integrase, especially at the integration step. Moreover, both mutations conferred an intermediate level of resistance to dolutegravir. Interestingly, the F121Y mutation, but not the G118R mutation, displayed differential resistance to raltegravir and dolutegravir. Indeed, the F121Y mutation was more resistant to raltegravir than to dolutegravir\nRationale: The paper mentions in vitro assay test of mutations, and mentions the intermediate level of resistance to dolutegravir.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 25808007\nQuestion ID: 9\nQuestion: Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?\nEvidence: \"Integrase substitutions E92Q, Y143C, E92Q + Y143C, and Q148R conferred relatively low levels of resistance to dolutegravir in HIV-2 ~ROD9~ (2- to 6-fold), but Q148K, E92Q + N155H, T97A + N155H and G140S + Q148R resulted in moderate resistance (10- to 46-fold), and the combination of T97A + Y143C in HIV-2 ~ROD9~ conferred high-level resistance (\\>5000-fold). To examine potential resistance pathways in HIV-2, we tested the activity of dolutegravir against a panel of site-directed mutants of HIV-2 ~ROD9~ using the single-cycle assay. These variants contained amino acid replacements in the integrase protein that are associated with raltegravir and elvitegravir treatment; their phenotypes with respect to raltegravir and elvitegravir susceptibility have been reported elsewhere.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the integrase gene of HIV-1 and HIV-2, examining the effects of various integrase mutations on the susceptibility to dolutegravir.

For in vitro analysis in TZMBl cells, plasmid pNL4-3 (NIH, catalog number 114) was used as an HIV-M (subtype B) reference virus. The infectious HIV-O clone pCOM2.5 was graciously provided by HG Kräusslich (Abteilung, Virologie, Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg, Germany). Susceptibility to INSTIs in TZMbl Cells. To determine the susceptibility of pCMOwt and viral variants to different INSTIs in culture, we used a cell culture–based phenotypic assay with TZMBl cells as previously described.24,27 The EC 50 , obtained from 3 independent experiments in triplicate, was calculated using GraphPad Prism software. The results were also expressed on the basis of FC, that is, the ratio of EC 50 of a mutated virus/EC 50 wt, using pCMOwt as a reference (FC = 1).\nRationale: The paper includes both phenotypic assays using TZMBl cells to assess the susceptibility of pCMOwt and viral variants to integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) like raltegravir (RAL), elvitegravir (EVG), and dolutegravir (DTG).

We investigated\nthe virological and biochemical inhibitory potentials of EFdA against a\nbroad spectrum of subtype-specific chimeric viruses and compared it with\ntenofovir alafenamide, nevirapine, efavirenz, rilpivirine and\netravirine.\n\n### Methods\n\npNL4.3 chimeric viruses encoding *gag-pol* from treatment-naive patients\n( *n* = 24) and therapy-failure patients ( *n* = 3) and a panel of\nreverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant strains ( *n* = 7) were used\nto compare the potency of reverse transcriptase inhibitor drugs. The\nphenotypic drug susceptibility assay was performed using TZM-bl cells.\n*In vitro* inhibition assays were done using patient-derived reverse\ntranscriptase. IC ~50~ values of NNRTIs were calculated using a\nPicoGreen-based spectrophotometric assay. Steady-state kinetics were\nused to determine the apparent binding affinity ( *K* ~m.dNTP~ ) of\ntriphosphate form of EFdA (EFdA-TP) and dATP.\n\n### Results\n\nAmong the chimeric treatment-naive viruses, EFdA had an *ex vivo*\nantiretroviral activity \\[median (IQR) EC ~50~ = 1.4 nM (0.6--2.1 nM)\\]\ncomparable to that of tenofovir alafenamide \\[1.6 nM (0.5--3.6 nM)\\].\nSubtype-specific differences were found for etravirine ( *P* = 0.004)\nand rilpivirine ( *P* = 0.017), where HIV-1C had the highest EC ~50~\nvalues. EFdA had a greater comparative efficiency \\[calculated by\ndividing the efficiency of monophosphate form of EFdA (EFdA-MP)\nincorporation ( *k* ~cat.EFdA-TP~ / *K* ~m.EFdA-TP~ ) over the\nefficiency of dATP incorporation ( *k* ~cat.dATP~ / *K* ~m.dATP~ )\\]\ncompared with the natural substrate dATP, with a fold change of between\n1.6 and 3.2. *Ex vivo* analysis on reverse transcriptase\ninhibitor-resistant strains showed EFdA to have a higher potency.\nDespite the presence of rilpivirine DRMs, some non-B strains showed\nhypersusceptibility to rilpivirine.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nOur combined virological and biochemical data suggest that EFdA inhibits\nboth WT and reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant viruses\nefficiently in a subtype-independent manner. In contrast, HIV-1C is\nleast susceptible to etravirine and rilpivirine.\n\n\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Cell lines, plasmids and antiretrovirals\n\nTZM-bl ^21^ cells were obtained from NIH AIDS Reagent Program, NIH, USA.\n293 T cells were purchased from ATCC, USA. TZM-bl and 293 T cells were\nmaintained in culture medium consisting of DMEM (Sigma, USA)\nsupplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics\n(100 IU/mL and 50 μg/mL, respectively) and 2 mM l -glutamine. MT-4 cells\nwere maintained in RPMI medium containing 10% FBS,\npenicillin/streptomycin antibiotics (100 IU/mL and 50 μg/mL,\nrespectively) and 2 mM l -glutamine. The plasmid pNL43, ^22^ which is\nderived from a WT HIV-1B strain, and seven RT-resistant HIV-1B viruses\ncontaining major DRMs \\[plasmid clones 12227 (M41L, T215Y, K101P,\nK103N), 12229 (M41L, L74V, M184V, T215Y, L100I, K103N), 12233 (K70R,\nM184V, T215F, K101E, Y181V), 12235 (M41L, E44D, D67N, T69D, L74I, L210W,\nT215Y, K101E, Y181C, G190A), 12239 (M41L, T215D, K101E, E138K, Y181C),\n12241 (K101E, G190S), 12243 (M41L, D67G, L74I, M184V, T215Y, L100I,\nM230L)\\] were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program, NIH, USA. ^23^\nThe following drugs were purchased from Selleckchem, USA: nevirapine,\nefavirenz, etravirine, rilpivirine and tenofovir alafenamide.\n\n### Clinical specimens\n\nStored plasma samples from patients who were either therapy naive ( *n*\n= 42) or had a virological treatment failure ( *n* = 9) were randomly\nselected from the HIV cohort at Karolinska University Hospital,\nStockholm, Sweden. Of these, 11 samples did not give any positive clones\neven after multiple efforts, and 13 were not replication competent.\nFinally we obtained 24 replication-competent viruses from\ntreatment-naive individuals who were pure subtypes (HIV-1A1, *n* = 1;\nHIV-1B, *n* = 5; HIV-1C, *n* = 15) or circulating recombinant forms\n(CRFs) (01_AE, *n* = 1; 02_AG, *n* = 2), whilst the viruses extracted\nfrom patients with therapy failure ( *n* = 3) were HIV-1B ( *n* = 1),\nHIV-1D ( *n* =  1) and HIV-1C ( *n* = 1), as determined by our\npreviously published near full-length sequencing protocol. ^24^ The A1,\n01_AE and 02_AG were grouped as A-like viruses as described earlier for\nstatistical analysis. ^25^\n\nThe three viruses extracted from therapy-failure patients had the\nfollowing mutations: HIV-1D, K65R, T69del, L100I, Y181C, Y188L, H221Y;\nHIV-1C, K65R, M184V, V108I, Y181C, G190S; HIV-1B, M41L, D67N, K70R,\nM184V, L210W, T215Y, K219E, K103S and G190A. Ethics clearance for the\nstudy was obtained from the Regional Ethics Committee of Stockholm,\nSweden (Dnr 2014/928-31/2 and 2013/1944-31/4). All participants gave\ninformed consent.\n\n### Recombinant virus production\n\nBriefly, viral RNA was extracted using the QIAmp viral RNA extraction\nkit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) from 140 μL of plasma. The *gag-pol*\nfragment (HXB2: 0702-5798) was cloned into pNL43 plasmid following\ndigestion with BssHII and SalI (New England Biolabs, USA) and ligation\nusing T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs), as described by us\npreviously. ^26^ The chimeric viruses were produced by transient\ntransfection of the plasmids into the 293 T cell line using FuGENE ^®^\nHD Transfection Reagent (Promega, USA) and harvested 72 h later by\ncollection of the cell-free supernatant via centrifugation; aliquots\nwere stored at −80°C.\n\n### Drug susceptibility assay (DSA)\n\nDSA was performed by determining the extent to which EFdA, nevirapine,\nefavirenz, etravirine, rilpivirine and tenofovir alafenamide inhibited\nthe replication of the reference virus (NL43) and the 24 treatment-naive\npatient-derived chimeric viruses (HIV-1B, 6; HIV-1C, 14; HIV-1A-like,\n4). Drugs serially diluted in culture medium, spanning from 10 to\n0.000001 μM, were added in triplicate in 96-well plates that had been\nseeded 24 h before the start with 10 000 TZM-bl cells/well. The viruses\nwere added to each well at an moi of 0.05 IU/cell in the presence of\n10 μg/mL DEAE. Virus replication was quantified by measuring luciferase\nactivity (relative light units) using the Bright *-* Glo *™* Luciferase\nAssay System (Promega, USA) 48 h post-infection. Drug concentrations\nrequired for inhibiting virus replication by 50% (EC ~50~ ) were\ncalculated from a dose--response curve using non-linear regression\nanalysis (GraphPad Prism, version 6.07; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA,\nUSA).\n\nThe DSA experiments were performed with three technical replicates for\neach virus with the specified dynamic concentration range of the drug,\nand at least two independent analyses (biological replicates) were\nperformed. The reproducibility of the DSA was assessed based on the 95%\nCI obtained for the drug EC ~50~ and the degree of correlation between\ntechnical replicates. The output for the drug EC ~50~ results was used\nto compute the fold change value for each virus relative to NL4.3 before\nbeing exported to GraphPad Prism software for graphical representation\nand statistical analysis.\n\n### Cloning and purification of RT\n\nPatient-derived HIV-1 RT enzymes were used in NNRTI susceptibility and\nkinetics assays. All enzymes were purified as described previously. ^27^\nBriefly, The RT genes of different subtypes were PCR amplified from DNA\namplicons of viruses isolated from patients infected with diverse\nsubtypes. For the cloning of the p66 subunit, NcoI and SalI restriction\nsites were added, except for 02_AG, for which primers were designed to\nadd the SalI restriction site. For the cloning of the p51 subunit, BamHI\nand SalI restriction sites were added. The p66 subunit was cloned in the\npCDFDuet-1 vector (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), whereas for p51\nthe pRSFDuet-1 vector (EMD Millipore) was used. The p51 subunit\ncontained a 6X histidine tag on its N terminus when expressed. The\ncloned genes on each plasmid are controlled by a T7 promoter and *lac*\noperator. The proteins were expressed and purified using an Ni-affinity\ncolumn.\n\n### IC ~50~ values of NNRTIs\n\nThe NNRTI susceptibility assays were conducted in 96-well plates by\nmeasuring the conversion of double-stranded DNA from Td ~100~ /Pd ~18~\ntemplate-primer using a PicoGreen-based spectrophotometric assay in the\npresence of increasing concentrations of NNRTIs. The reactions,\nconsisting of 20 nM RTs from different subtypes, 50 nm Td ~100~ /Pd ~18~\nand 10 μm dNTPs in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.8, and 60 mM\nKCl, were initiated by adding 5 mm MgCl ~2~ . The reactions were allowed\nto proceed for 30 min at 37°C followed by quenching with the addition of\n100 mm EDTA. Quant-iT ^TM^ PicoGreen reagent (Invitrogen, USA) was added\nto quantify the amount of double-stranded DNA formed in TE buffer. The\nreaction mixtures were excited at 480 nm and fluorescence was monitored\nat 520 nm using an EnSpire Multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life\nSciences). Dose--response curves of triplicate samples were plotted\nusing GraphPad Prism version 6.07 (GraphPad, Inc.) to determine the IC\n~50~ values of NNRTIs.\n\n### Steady-state kinetics of dATP and EFdA-TP incorporation\n\nWe used steady-state kinetics to determine the apparent binding affinity\n( *K* ~m.dNTP~ ) of triphosphate form of EFdA (EFdA-TP) and dATP with\nenzyme/template-primer (31/18-mer) complex. In these assays, 10 nM RT\nand 100 nM T/P were incubated in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH\n7.8, and 60 mM KCl. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 mM\nMgCl ~2~ and increasing concentrations of dATP (10 nM to 25 μM) or\nEFdA-TP (2.5 nM to 5 μM). The reactions were allowed to proceed for\n2 min followed by quenching by the addition of a solution containing 95%\nformamide, 0.01% bromophonol blue and 25 mM EDTA. The reaction products\nwere resolved on a 16% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel. The bands\ncorresponding to 19-mer product were visualized on Typhoon (Thermo\nFisher, USA) and quantified by ImageQuant (GE Electronics, USA). The\ninitial velocity of reaction at each dATP or EFdA-TP concentration was\nfitted to a hyperbolic function (Michaelis--Menten equation) to\ndetermine *k* ~cat~ and *K* ~m.substrate~ . The efficiency of nucleotide\nincorporation \\[monophosphate form of EFdA (EFdA-MP) or dAMP\\] was\ndefined as the ratio of *k* ~cat~ to *K* ~m~ . The comparative\nefficiency of EFdA-TP over dATP was calculated by dividing the\nefficiency of EFdA-MP incorporation ( *k* ~cat.EFdA-TP~ / *K*\n~m.EFdA-TP~ ) over the efficiency of dATP incorporation ( *k* ~cat.dATP~\n/ *K* ~m.dATP~ ).\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nDescriptive values for the EC ~50~ in nM for each drug are represented\nas the median and IQR. The difference between two drugs was evaluated\nusing the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. Subtype-specific\ndifferences were measured using the Kruskal--Wallis test. All\nstatistical analysis were computed in GraphPad Prism version 6.07\n(GraphPad, Inc.).\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Ex vivo antiretroviral potency on WT viruses\n\nThe chimeric viruses derived from therapy-naive patients ( *n* = 24)\nwere used to investigate the susceptibility to six RTI drugs: EFdA,\nnevirapine, efavirenz, etravirine, rilpivirine and tenofovir alafenamide\n(Figure ​ (Figure1a). 1 a). EFdA had an *ex vivo* antiretroviral activity\n\\[median (IQR) EC ~50~ =1.4 nM (0.6--2.1 nM)\\] comparable to that of\ntenofovir alafenamide \\[1.6 nM (0.5--3.6 nM)\\] (Figure ​ (Figure1a). 1\na). The NNRTIs rilpivirine \\[0.8 nM (0.5--1.2 nM)\\], etravirine \\[1.2 nM\n(0.4--1.6 nM)\\] and efavirenz \\[1.1 nM (0.7--1.9 nM)\\] all had higher\npotency than nevirapine \\[48.9 nM (29.7--85.5 nM)\\] ( *P* \\< 0.001, for\nall comparisons). In addition, rilpivirine showed higher potency than\nefavirenz ( *P* = 0.049).\n\nFigure 1.\n\nEffects of EFdA and other RTIs on 24 chimeric viruses representing\nHIV-1B ( *n* = 5), HIV-1C ( *n* = 15), HIV-1A1 ( *n* = 1), HIV-1-01_AE (\n*n* = 1), HIV-1-02_AG ( *n* = 2) and WT reference pNL4-3. (a) Intra-drug\ncomparative analysis of the log ~2~ EC ~50~ . Each virus is represented\nby a single circle on the graph. The log ~2~ median EC ~50~ value and\nIQR are indicated. Significant differences are shown as *P* values\nobtained from performing the Mann--Whitney test for each of two drugs.\nThe actual EC ~50~ values are presented as median (IQR) below each drug\nabbreviation. The G190A contacting viruses were excluded from the median\nEC ~50~ analysis of nevirapine. Subtype-specific comparisons for (b)\netravirine and (c) rilpivirine on HIV-1B, HIV-1C and HIV-1A-like\nviruses. The median EC ~50~ value and IQR are indicated. Significant\ndifferences were found for etravirine ( *P* = 0.004) and rilpivirine (\n*P* = 0.017). Statistical analyses were performed using the\nKruskal--Wallis test.

For nevirapine, non-B subtypes showed lower IC\n~50~ values compared with HIV-1B (HIV-1B versus HIV-1C, *P* = 0.02;\nHIV-1B versus HIV-102_AG, *P* = 0.005). In line with the cell-based\nassay, for both etravirine and rilpivirine, HIV-1C had higher IC ~50~\nvalues compared with HIV-1B ( *P* = 0.03 and *P* = 0.02, respectively),\n01_AE ( *P* = 0.02 and *P* = 0.02, respectively) and 02_AG ( *P* = 0.006\nand *P* = 0.01, respectively). The steady-state kinetics of nucleotide\nincorporation showed that EFdA was preferred over natural substrate\ndATP, with a fold change of between 1.6 and 3.2 (Table ​ (Table1). 1 ).\nNo statistical difference in comparative efficiency was observed between\nthe subtypes. Intriguingly, the polymerase efficiency of the\nmonophosphate form of EFdA (EFdA-MP) incorporation by HIV-1C RT was\nsignificantly less than those of the RT of the other subtypes.\n\nFigure 2.\n\n*In vitro* biochemical data on the IC ~50~ values of different NNRTIs\nfor different HIV-1 subtypes.

In SE138.4, a polymorphic mutation K103R was detected, whereas in\nSE141.5, K101Q, a relatively non-polymorphic mutation, was detected. No\nother accessory mutations were detected. The genotypic resistance\nprediction in the Stanford HIV drug resistance database identified all\nthe strains as intermediate- to high-level resistant to all NRTIs except\nzidovudine and NNRTIs (Figure ​ (Figure3b). 3 b). The DSA was performed\non three resistant viruses from treatment-failure patients, one\nG190A-containing strain from a treatment-naive individual, and seven\nNNRTI-resistant viruses obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program. The\nlog ~2~ fold changes in EC ~50~ against WT pNL4-3 viruses in NNRTIs are\nshown in Figure ​ Figure4(a). 4 (a). It is interesting to note that\ndespite the presence of four rilpivirine mutations (L100I, Y181C, Y188L\nand H221Y), the HIV-1D strain (SE138.4) showed hypersusceptibility to\nrilpivirine, and another virus (SE141.5) with V108I, Y181C and G190S\nmutations showed 18 (4 log ~2~ ) fold lower susceptibility to\nrilpivirine. The third HIV-1B virus (SE061.2) with the G190A mutation\nwas hypersusceptible to rilpivirine. Similar data were obtained for the\nHIV-1A1 virus with the single G190A mutation obtained from a\ntreatment-naive individual. As expected, the seven NNRTI-panel HIV-1B\nviruses showed reduced susceptibility to all the drugs (nevirapine,\nefavirenz, etravirine and rilpivirine) (Figure ​ (Figure4 4 b).\n\nFigure 3.\n\nMultiple sequence alignment and genotypic resistance prediction.

EFdA suppressed seven out of nine viruses with NRTI\nmutations, of which hypersusceptibility was found in four viruses: 12243\n(fold resistance = 0.091), SE138.4 (fold resistance = 0.69), SE141.5\n(fold resistance = 0.33) and SE061.2 (fold resistance = 0.02).\nInterestingly two of the viruses, SE138.4 and SE141.5, had the K65R\nmutation. EFdA showed 3-fold reduced susceptibility in a virus with both\nthymidine analogue mutations pathway 1 (TAM-1) (M41L, T210W and T215Y)\nand pathway 2 (TAM-2) (D67N), along with other mutations (E44D, L74I and\nT69D), but had still better activity than tenofovir alafenamide (fold\nresistance = 10). Interestingly when both TAM-1 (M41L, T210W, T215Y) and\nTAM-2 (D67N, K70R, K219E) with the M184V mutation were present, EFdA\nshowed hypersusceptibility. One virus with TAM-1 (M41L, T215Y) and L74V\nshowed a high fold resistance to EFdA. Despite the presence of the K65R\nmutation, one virus (K65R and T69deletion) showed susceptibility to\ntenofovir alafenamide, and another (K65R and M184V) 3-fold resistance\n(Figure ​ (Figure4 4 c).\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\ncART remains the most effective approach for managing the HIV pandemic.\nHowever, the introduction of novel antiretrovirals has created a need\nfor phenotypic analysis to evaluate their potency and drug resistance\nprofiles, not only for HIV-1B but also for the globally dominating non-B\nsubtypes. In this study, we created a panel of non-B subtype chimeric\nviruses with or without DRMs and investigated the *ex vivo* and *in\nvitro* potency of first- and second-generation RTIs commonly used in\nlow- and middle-income countries, and compared these with the novel drug\nEFdA. Our biochemical and virological study indicated that EFdA\nexhibited high efficiency against both WT viruses and DRM-containing\nviruses in a subtype-independent manner. In addition, EFdA showed equal\nefficacy or hypersusceptibility for most drug-resistant viruses when\ncompared with WT viruses. In contrast, the second-generation NNRTIs\netravirine and rilpivirine had a lower potency in HIV-1C strains.\n\nIn the DSA, EFdA displayed *ex vivo* potency for WT chimeric viruses\ncomparable to that shown by other RTIs. The EC ~50~ values for other\nRTIs used in our study were in the ranges reported previously. Thus, the\nreported median EC ~50~ values are in the range of 5 nM ^28^ ^,^ ^29^ to\n10 nM ^18^ for tenofovir alafenamide, between 1.5 nM ^18^ and 2.0 nM\n^30^ for efavirenz, 0.1--2.0 nM for rilpivirine, ^31^ and 1.4--4.0 nM\n^32^ for etravirine, and our value of 48.87 nM for nevirapine is close\nto the reported value of 84 nM found in enzymatic assays. ^33^ The\nslight differences in published values compared with our values are most\nlikely attributable to differences in the phenotypic assays used.\n\nThe results of our analysis of the EFdA susceptibility of the\nRTI-resistant strains confirm the strong potential EFdA has as an RTI,\ne.g. in a salvage regimen. Furthermore, no subtype-specific differences\nin EFdA susceptibility were found, supporting the use of EFdA in\ncountries where non-HIV-1B viruses are dominating.\n\nMoreover, tenofovir alafenamide, nevirapine and efavirenz had similar\nefficacy, independent of the subtype. In contrast, HIV-1C was less\nsusceptible to both etravirine and rilpivirine, as compared with\nnon-HIV-1C. This is a novel finding although an earlier study concluded\nthat HIV-1C viruses containing DRMs against nevirapine and efavirenz\nwill have decreased efficacy against both etravirine and rilpivirine in\nnearly half of the patients. However, no comparisons were done with\nnon-HIV-1C in that study. ^34^ Our finding adds further caution over the\nuse of second-generation NNRTIs in HIV-1C-infected patients. Analysis of\npatients from the EARNEST trial ^35^ failing first-line ART reported\nthat non-B subtypes differ in DRMs, which impacts the residual NNRTI\nsusceptibility. In particular, a higher rate of etravirine and\nrilpivirine resistance was predicted for HIV-1C, which limits their\npotential utility in further regimens. ^36^ ^,^ ^37^ Another\ncomplementary possibility is that HIV-1C might harbour uncharacterized\nnatural SNPs that possibly could reduce the fitness and delay the onset\nof viruses harbouring etravirine DRMs, resulting in a further\naccumulation of DRMs. Such an example is the emergence of the N348I\nmutation in the connection domain of HIV-1 RT, which has been shown to\nreduce the fitness of E138K-carrying HIV-1 strains known to be have a\nreduced etravirine susceptibility, delaying the detection of these\nresistant viruses. ^38^ The same could be the case for rilpivirine.\n\nThe complex issue of subtype-specific differences in resistance is\nillustrated by our finding that rilpivirine DRMs, e.g. G190A, were\npresent in viral strains that were hypersusceptible to rilpivirine. This\ncould be due to the presence of other mutations as well. Thus, one of\nthe HIV-1B-panel viruses (NIH1883), which had G190A along with Y181C and\nK101E, showed a 12-fold resistance, but, in contrast, an HIV-1D virus\nwith four potential rilpivirine mutations was hypersusceptible to\nrilpivirine. This finding was further supported by biochemical data\nsuggesting that HIV-1C had higher IC ~50~ values of etravirine and\nrilpivirine, indicating a subtype-specific effect in the binding\naffinity of different HIV-1 RTs. This finding further supports our\nearlier report where we showed that HIV-1C RT had a 2-fold higher IC\n~50~ of rilpivirine. ^37^\n\nEFdA consistently suppressed both therapy-naive and resistant viruses.\nThe K65R- and M184V-carrying strains were suppressed more effectively by\nEFdA than by tenofovir alafenamide. The superiority of EFdA is supported\nby mechanistic studies that have used single cycle cell-based assays\nshowing that has tenofovir-resistant viruses with the K65R mutation have\na 2.5-fold increased hypersusceptibility to EFdA-TP. ^14^ The 2′fluoro\ngroup in EFdA is resistant to cellular degradation by deaminases and\nextends the half-life of EFdA more than 72 h in *in vitro* experiments,\n^12^ making EFdA a strong candidate for use as a long-acting drug. A\nrecent study showed a significant increase in the proportion of patients\nwith TAM at failure of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based first-line\nART including the standard tenofovir disoproxil fumarate mutation K65R.\n^8^ Therefore, zidovudine may not be ideal for those patients as a\nsecond-line option. Therefore, EFdA can potentially fill the gap as\nviral strains with K65R are hypersusceptible to EFdA. These *in vitro*\nexperiments give further support for the use of EFdA in all HIV-1\nsubtypes. Thus, the comparative efficiency determinations showed that\nEFdA-TP was selected better (by at least 2-fold) by RTs from all\nsubtypes. The high binding efficacy of EFdA is mainly due to 4′ethynyl\ngroup, which binds to a hydrophobic pocket explicitly present in the\nstructure of HIV-1 RT, ^9^ ^,^ ^10^ and this binding site is conserved\nin HIV-1B, HIV-1C, 01_AE and 02_AG.\n\nOur study has limitations that merit comment. First, the low numbers and\nunevenness of therapy-naive chimeric viruses could potentially result in\na statistical bias. This is mainly due to the failure of cloning or\nnon-functional viruses. Second, four HIV-1 RTs were used to study the\nefficacy of six drugs in our biochemical assays. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the highest number of enzymes and drugs used in any\nstudy as most of the earlier studies were often restricted to one. It\nmust also be emphasized that these experiments were conducted as a\nproof-of-concept.\n\nIn conclusion, our combined *in vitro* virological and biochemical\nanalysis suggests that EFdA inhibits both WT and RTI-resistant viruses\nefficiently in a subtype-independent manner and is, therefore, a valid\nchoice of drug for clinical trials involving both therapy-naive (as\nfirst-line drug) and therapy-failure (as second-line drug) individuals.\nIn contrast, subtype-specific differences were observed for etravirine\nand rilpivirine. Rilpivirine DRMs in non-B subtypes need further\ninvestigation given that rilpivirine is part of a long-acting\nformulation under development. It can be claimed that these\nsubtype-specific differences for etravirine and rilpivirine described by\nus *in vitro* and *ex vivo* have not been shown to be of relevance *in\nvivo* . However, when an antiretroviral is introduced on a large scale\nto patients outside well-controlled clinical trials, it is still\npossible that such differences may result in differences in clinical\noutcome, especially in patients with suboptimal adherence.\n\n\n\n### Funding\n\nThis work was supported by grants from the Swedish Research Council\n(grant numbers 2016-01675 to A.

Genotypic analysis ascertained the appearance and accumulation of NNRTI RAMs. Phenotypic drug susceptibility assays assessed resistance conferred by acquired NNRTI RAMs.\nResults:\nFor WT viruses, doravirine pressure led to the appearance of V108I or V106A/I/M RAMs after 8 weeks, conferring low-level (~2-fold) resistance. After 24 weeks, the accumulation of three to six secondary RAMs, including F227L, M230L, L234I and/or Y318, resulted in high-level (>100-fold) resistance to doravirine. Notably, viruses with these doravirine RAMs remained susceptible to rilpivirine and efavirenz. This contrasted with rilpivirine where acquisition of E138K, L100I and/or K101E resulted in >50-fold cross-resistance to all NNRTIs. Doravirine selection of viruses bearing common NRTI and NNRTI RAMs showed delayed acquisition of RAMs compared with WT virus. Pairing doravirine with islatravir or lamivudine attenuated the development of NNRTI RAMs.\";\n\"Phenotypic drug susceptibility to doravirine, rilpivirine and efavirenz was monitored using a cell-based in vitro assay as previously described. Viruses were amplified from stored cell culture supernatants at designated weeks following in vitro selection. Resistant and WT control viruses were grown in CBMCs or MT-2 cells in the presence of serial dilutions of designated NNRTIs. After 7 days, culture supernatants were collected and analyzed for RT activity. The EC 50 drug concentrations were calculated using GraphPad version 6.07 software. The fold-resistance of emergent resistant variants was ascertained relative to matching WT counterparts grown in the absence of drug.\"\nRationale: The paper describes the results of phenotypic drug susceptibility assays that assess the resistance conferred by acquired NNRTI RAMs (Resistance-Associated Mutations) after serial passaging of viruses in escalating concentrations of doravirine and other drugs over 24 weeks.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 36708743\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Methods: Recombinant viruses expressing PLWH-derived protease, reverse transcriptase coding regions were generated from plasma samples at virological failure with documented resistance to protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, NNRTIs and integrase strand transfer inhibitors.

Briefly, RT mutants of HIV-1 were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quikchange II XL mutagenesis kit (Agilent) using specific primers introducing the expected mutations into plasmids pNL4-3, pHXB2, and pCRF02_AG. After mutagenesis, all constructs were sequenced to verify the presence of the mutations and the plasmids were prepared using the NucleoBond midi preparation kit (Macherey Nagel). Viral stocks were obtained by transfecting 293-T cells with the mutagenized HIV-1 molecular clones or the linearized pNL4-3ΔRT-RNAseH vector together with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicon including the corresponding RT-RNAseH coding region from each clinical sample, as previously described [12]. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the viral supernatants were recovered, quantified through the evaluation of the expression of β-galactosidase in TZM-bl cells, and frozen at −80°C.\n\nIn vitro susceptibility to doravirine was determined through a TZM-bl cell-based assay previously shown to correlate well with the reference phenotypic Phenosense Assay [13].

The susceptibility was assessed using a TZM-bl cell-based assay across a range of doravirine concentrations, and IC50 values (50% inhibition concentration) were calculated to determine the drug's effectiveness against these mutants.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 26149983\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is an investigational prodrug of the HIV-1 nucleotide reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NTRTI) tenofovir (TFV), with improved potency and drug delivery properties over the current prodrug, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). TAF is currently in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Phase 1 and 2 studies have shown that TAF was associated with increased peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) drug loading and increased suppression of HIV-1 replication compared to treatment with TDF. In this study, selection of in vitro resistance to both TAF and the parent compound, TFV, led to the emergence of HIV-1 with the K65R amino acid substitution in RT with 6.5-fold-reduced susceptibility to TAF. Although TAF is more potent than TFV in vitro, the antiviral susceptibilities to TAF and TFV of a large panel of nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant mutants were highly correlated (R2 = 0.97), indicating that the two compounds have virtually the same resistance profile when assessed as fold change from the wild type. TAF showed full antiviral activity in PBMCs against primary HIV-1 isolates with protease inhibitor, nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), or integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance but reduced activity against isolates with extensive NRTI resistance amino acid substitutions. However, the increased cell loading of TFV with TAF versus TDF observed in vivo suggests that TAF may retain activity against TDF-resistant mutant viruses.\nRationale: The paper describes the resistance selection experiments conducted with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and tenofovir (TFV).

Although the primary H51Y substitution did not confer resistance against DTG or RAL (FC values of 1.25 and 0.98, respectively), consistent with previous results ( 11 ), the addition of R262K did result in low-level but significant biochemical resistance to DTG but not to RAL (FC values of 1.9 and 0.92, respectively).\"\nRationale: The paper includes in vitro drug susceptibility data, specifically examining the susceptibility of HIV-1 to dolutegravir (DTG) and raltegravir (RAL) using short-term resistance assays with TZM-bl cells.\nAnswer: Yes"}

Values of 50%\neffective concentrations ranged from 1.2 to 2.5 nM for 9 HIV-1 isolates\nand 1.4 to 5.6 nM for 15 HIV-2 isolates. HIV-2 integrase mutants\nG140S/Q148R and G140S/Q148H were 34- and 110-fold resistant to\nbictegravir, respectively; other resistance-associated mutations\nconferred ≤5-fold changes in bictegravir susceptibility. Our findings\nindicate that bictegravir-based antiretroviral therapy should be\nevaluated in HIV-2-infected individuals.\n\n**KEYWORDS:** HIV treatment, HIV-2, West Africa, antiretroviral therapy,\nbictegravir, drug resistance, human immunodeficiency virus, integrase\n\n\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) infection remains a\nsignificant public health problem in West Africa, where the virus is\nendemic, and affects other areas with socioeconomic ties to the region (\n1 , -- 3 ). Relative to HIV-1 infection, HIV-2 infection usually\ninvolves a longer asymptomatic stage, with lower viral loads and slower\ndeclines in CD4 T-cell count ( 4 , -- 10 ). However, as with\nHIV-1-infected individuals, HIV-2-infected individuals have a high\nprobability of developing AIDS and dying from the disease unless they\nreceive antiretroviral therapy (ART) ( 6 , 11 , -- 13 ).\n\nChoices of antiretroviral drugs for HIV-2 are limited by the intrinsic\nresistance of the virus to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors and the reduced sensitivity of HIV-2 to several HIV-1-active\nprotease inhibitors ( 14 , 15 ). In contrast, HIV-2 is fully susceptible\nto nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and to the integrase\ninhibitors (INIs) raltegravir, elvitegravir, dolutegravir, and\ncabotegravir, with 50% effective concentrations (EC ~50~ s) comparable\nto those seen for HIV-1 ( 16 , -- 22 ). Importantly, the use of\nINI-containing regimens for HIV-2 treatment is supported by cohort-based\nstudies ( 23 , -- 28 ) and by the outcomes of recent clinical trials (\n29 , 30 ).\n\nBictegravir (formerly known as GS-9883) is a new INI that is\ncoformulated with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide in the\nfixed-dose, single-tablet antiretroviral regimen Biktarvy (Gilead\nSciences, Inc.) ( 31 , 32 ). Although Biktarvy was recently approved by\nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (February 2018) for treatment of\nHIV-1 infection, data supporting the potential use of\nbictegravir/Biktarvy for HIV-2 treatment are scarce. To date, there are\nno published case reports or clinical studies describing the use of\nbictegravir in HIV-2-infected individuals. With regard to *in vitro*\nactivity, Tsiang and colleagues ( 33 ) reported that a single HIV-2\ngroup B isolate was susceptible to bictegravir in culture (EC ~50~ ,\n1.7 nM). More recently, Le Hingrat et al. ( 34 ) showed that bictegravir\ninhibited HIV-2 ~ROD9~ and two HIV-2 isolates from treatment-naive\npatients with EC ~50~ values ranging from 0.8 to 3.8 nM, versus an EC\n~50~ of 1.4 nM for HIV-1 ~BRU~ . Both studies used spreading infections\nof human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to measure\nanti-HIV-2 activity.\n\nTo further evaluate the potential suitability of bictegravir for HIV-2\ntreatment, we tested the activity of the drug against a panel of group A\nand group B HIV-2 isolates from ART-naive individuals. HIV-1 isolates\nrepresenting group M subtypes A, B, C, D, and F and group O were\nincluded for comparison. We also determined the activity of bictegravir\nagainst several site-directed mutants of HIV-2 that are resistant to\nraltegravir and cross-resistant to other INIs as described below.\n\nAll drug susceptibility measurements were performed using our\nestablished MAGIC-5A indicator cell assay, which quantifies\ndrug-dependent inhibition in a single round of HIV infection ( 35 ). We\npreviously showed that the results obtained with this assay are\nconcordant with those seen in spreading infections of immortalized\nT-cell lines, as demonstrated for the INIs raltegravir ( 17 ),\ndolutegravir ( 21 ), and cabotegravir ( 22 ). In addition, other groups\nhave used similar single-cycle assays to quantify the activity of\nvarious INIs against HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) ( 33\n, 36 , -- 40 ).\n\nMAGIC-5A cells are a HeLa-derived line that contains a β-galactosidase\ngene coupled to a Tat-inducible HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) ( 41 ,\n42 ). These cells express CD4 and the coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5 ( 41 )\nand are responsive to a broad range of HIV and SIV isolates, including\nHIV-2 (data not shown). In our drug susceptibility assay,\nstrain-to-strain differences in the intensity of β-galactosidase\nexpression do not influence the dose-response relationship, since all\nmeasurements of infection in the presence of drug are normalized to the\namount of infection observed in controls receiving no drug (i.e.,\nsolvent only). We used a constant interval of 44 h of infection for all\nHIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates tested in this study. After this period,\nβ-galactosidase expression was measured in lysates of the MAGIC-5A\nmonolayers as described elsewhere ( 35 ).\n\n### Inhibitor, cells, and virus.\n\nBictegravir was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. (North\nYork, ON, Canada). Master stocks and working dilutions of the drug were\nprepared as previously described for cabotegravir ( 22 ). MAGIC-5A\nindicator cells (HeLa-CD4-LTR-βgal) and the pROD9 infectious molecular\nclone of HIV-2 were obtained from Michael Emerman, Fred Hutchinson\nCancer Research Center, Seattle, WA. Full-length HIV-1 clone pNL4-3 was\nprovided by Bruce Chesebro, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Rocky\nMountain Laboratories, Hamilton, MT. Clones p89.6 and pMJ4 (encoding\nHIV-1) and pHIV-2/ST were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program\n(ARP). Cell-free stocks of HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ , HIV-1 ~89.6~ , HIV-1 ~MJ4~ ,\nHIV-2 ~ROD9~ , and HIV-2 ~ST~ were generated by transfecting the\ncorresponding plasmid molecular clones into cultures of 293T/17 human\nembryonic kidney cells as previously described ( 43 , 44 ). HIV-2 ~EHO~\n, HIV-2 ~COU~ , and HIV-2 ~BER~ were kindly provided by Jan McClure\n(University of Washington, Seattle, WA). The remaining HIV-1 and HIV-2\nisolates used in this study were obtained from NIH ARP.\n\n### Comparative analysis of HIV-1 and HIV-2.\n\nBictegravir showed strong dose-dependent activity against HIV-1 ~NL4~\n~-3~ in the single-cycle assay, with an EC ~50~ of 1.7 nM, and other\ngroup M isolates of HIV-1 were highly susceptible to the drug (EC ~50~ ,\n1.2 to 2.1 nM) ( Table 1 ). These results are consistent with previous\nmeasurements of the activity of bictegravir against group M HIV-1 in\nmulticycle infections of human PBMC ( 33 , 34 ) and cord blood\nmononuclear cells ( 45 ) and in immortalized T-cell lines ( 33 ). In\naddition, bictegravir was highly active against HIV-1 group O isolates\nBCF01 and MVP5180-91 in the single-cycle assay (EC ~50~ , 2.5 and\n1.4 nM, respectively) ( Table 1 ). To our knowledge, these are the first\ndata showing that group O HIV-1 isolates are sensitive to bictegravir in\nculture.\n\nFor HIV-2, we performed a total of seven assay runs in which the\nprototypic strain HIV-2 ~ROD9~ (group A) was tested head to head against\nHIV-1 ~NL4-3~ . Dose-response curves for these two strains were\nsimilarly shaped ( Fig. 1A ), and there was no statistically significant\ndifference between the EC ~50~ values for HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ and HIV-2 ~ROD9~\nin these experiments ( Fig. 1B ). After five additional assays, the mean\nEC ~50~ for HIV-2 ~ROD9~ was 2.0 nM ( *n* = 12 independent\ndeterminations) ( Table 2 ).\n\nFIG 1\n\nAntiviral activity of bictegravir against HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ and HIV-2 ~ROD9~\nin MAGIC-5A cells. Error bars indicate ±1 SD and, when not visible, are\nsmaller than the symbols. (A) Results from a single assay in which HIV-1\n~NL4-3~ and HIV-2 ~ROD9~ were tested head to head. Data points represent\nthe amount of β-galactosidase activity produced in HIV-infected\nbictegravir-treated cultures relative to HIV-infected solvent-only\n(i.e., no-drug) controls. Each point is the mean of two cultures that\nwere maintained in parallel. Curves were generated using a sigmoidal\nregression equation (GraphPad Prism 6.0 software). (B) EC ~50~ values\nfrom seven independent runs of the single-cycle assay in which HIV-1\n~NL4-3~ and HIV-2 ~ROD9~ were tested head to head. *P* value is the\nresult of a paired *t* test.\n\nOther group A isolates of HIV-2 yielded EC ~50~ values comparable to\nthose of HIV-2 ~ROD9~ (range, 1.4 to 2.6 nM) ( Table 2 ). However, we\nobserved slightly higher EC ~50~ values for three group B isolates:\nHIV-2 ~CDC310319~ , HIV-2 ~EHO~ , and HIV-2 ~DIL~ (fold difference\nrelative to HIV-2 ~ROD9~ , 1.7, 2.8, and 1.5, respectively; *P* \\< 0.05,\nanalysis of variance with Sidak's posttest) ( Table 2 ). The remaining\ngroup B strains (HIV-2 ~CDC310072~ , HIV-2 ~COU~ , and HIV-2 ~BER~ ) and\nthe A/B intergroup recombinant HIV-2 ~7312A~ (CRF01_AB, which encodes a\ngroup B integrase sequence) were not significantly different from HIV-2\n~ROD9~ ( *P* \\> 0.05, analysis of variance with Sidak's posttest) (\nTable 2 ).\n\nAltogether, there was no statistically significant difference between\ngroup A and group B HIV-2 isolates with respect to bictegravir\nsusceptibility ( Fig. 2A ). Average EC ~50~ values (±1 standard\ndeviation) for HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates were 1.7 ± 0.4  and\n2.4 ± 1.0 nM, respectively, a difference of only 1.4-fold ( Fig. 2B ).\n\nFIG 2\n\nSummary of the activity of bictegravir against HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates\nin MAGIC-5A cells. (A) Comparison of the EC ~50~ values for group A and\ngroup B isolates of HIV-2. (B) Comparison of all EC ~50~ values for\nHIV-1 and HIV-2. Each point represents the mean EC ~50~ for a single\nvirus isolate. Filled squares and circles indicate the EC ~50~ values\nfor HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ and HIV-2 ~ROD9~ , respectively. Horizontal lines\nindicate the mean EC ~50~ values for each grouping. *P* values are from\nWelch's *t* tests.\n\nTo ensure that our EC ~50~ measurements were not confounded by\ncytostatic or cytotoxic effects, we determined the toxicity of\nbictegravir in MAGIC-5A cells using the CellTiter Glo luminescent cell\nviability assay (Promega, Inc.). The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC\n~50~ ) of bictegravir in MAGIC-5A cells was \\>10 μM (see Fig. S1 in the\nsupplemental material), indicating a selectivity index (CC ~50~ /EC ~50~\n) of ≥1,000 in the single-cycle assay. Thus, the dose-response profiles\nseen for HIV-1 and HIV-2 were not influenced by drug-mediated inhibition\nof cell growth.\n\nTo directly compare the activity of bictegravir, dolutegravir, and\ncabotegravir against HIV-2, we performed an additional series of\nexperiments in which the three INIs were tested head to head (i.e., in\nthe same assay run) in MAGIC-5A cells. Group A HIV-2 ~ROD9~ and HIV-2\n~CBL-23~ isolates showed nearly identical susceptibilities to the three\nINIs, with EC ~50~ values that differed by 1.2-fold or less when\ncomparing bictegravir with dolutegravir or cabotegravir (see Fig. S2 in\nthe supplemental material). Likewise, the group B HIV-2 ~CDC310072~\nisolate showed comparable susceptibility to the three drugs, with EC\n~50~ s that differed by 1.3-fold for bictegravir versus dolutegravir and\n1.7-fold for bictegravir versus cabotegravir (Fig. S2). These data show\nthat bictegravir, dolutegravir, and cabotegravir have similar potency\nagainst HIV-2 in the single-cycle assay.\n\n### Analysis of HIV-2 integrase mutants.\n\nNext, we constructed and tested HIV-2 ~ROD9~ variants that contained\nsite-directed mutations in the integrase-encoding region of *pol* ;\nthese mutations emerge in raltegravir-treated HIV-2-infected patients\nand are known to confer resistance to raltegravir and other INIs in\nculture ( 17 , 20 , 21 , 24 , -- 27 , 33 , 39 , 45 , -- 51 ). We also\nincluded four site-directed mutants of HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ integrase as\ncontrol/comparator strains. Our objectives were to ensure that our assay\nwould reliably detect resistance to bictegravir in HIV-2 isolates and to\ntest representative variants from the three major mutational pathways\nthat lead to INI resistance; these pathways are anchored by amino acid\nreplacements at positions 143, 148, and 155 of the integrase protein (\n17 , 20 , 21 , 24 , -- 27 , 46 , -- 49 ; see also references 1 , 14 ,\nand 52 for reviews on this subject).\n\nAs previously reported for HIV-1, replacements G140S/Q148H in HIV-1\n~NL4-3~ integrase conferred low-level (2.0-fold) resistance to\nbictegravir ( 33 , 39 , 51 ), whereas the T97A/Y143C mutant did not show\nresistance to the drug ( 33 ) ( Table 3 ). In addition, the combination\nof E138K/G140S/Q148R in HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ , which conferred 10-fold\nresistance to cabotegravir in our previous study ( 22 ), yielded a\nmodest increase in the EC ~50~ for bictegravir (2.3-fold) ( Table 3 ).\n\n\nFor HIV-2 ~ROD9~ , integrase mutants G140S/Q148R and G140S/Q148H were\n34- and 110-fold resistant to bictegravir, respectively ( Table 3 ).\nSubstitutions G140A/Q148R, as well as various combinations of primary\nand secondary changes in the N155 pathway, resulted in low-level\nbictegravir resistance (1.9- to 4.6-fold). In contrast, HIV-2 ~ROD9~\nvariants with Y143-pathway mutations showed no evidence of resistance to\nbictegravir ( Table 3 ). Overall, the results obtained for the HIV-2\nintegrase mutants were similar to those seen in our recently published\nstudy of cabotegravir ( 22 ), although we note that the fold-resistance\nvalues for mutants G140A/Q148R and E92Q/N155H were lower for bictegravir\nby a factor of ∼2.5.\n\n### Potential role in HIV-2 treatment.\n\nOur analysis indicates that bictegravir is a potent inhibitor of HIV-2\nisolates from ART-naive individuals ( Table 2 ). Thus, all of the\nsecond-generation INIs that we have tested to date (dolutegravir,\ncabotegravir, and bictegravir) are highly active against HIV-2 in the\nsingle-cycle assay, with EC ~50~ values ranging from ∼1 to 5 nM ( 21 ,\n22 ).\n\nRegarding the site-directed mutants of HIV-2 integrase, amino acid\nreplacements in the N155 pathway resulted in low-level resistance to\nbictegravir, and mutations G140S/Q148H and G140S/Q148R conferred\nmoderate to high resistance to the drug ( Table 3 ). Our findings for\nHIV-2 ~ROD9~ are consistent with the recently reported\nsusceptibility/resistance phenotypes of five clinical isolates of HIV-2\nthat were obtained from INI-treated patients (encoding integrase\nmutations Y143R, T97A/Y143G, E92Q/T97A, E92Q/T97A/N155H, and\nG140S/Q148H) ( 34 ). In addition, we previously showed that G140S/Q148R\nconfers ≥50-fold resistance to raltegravir, elvitegravir, and\ndolutegravir in the HIV-2 ~ROD9~ isolate ( 21 , 49 ). Collectively,\nthese data suggest that the Q148 pathway might lead to cross-resistance\nbetween bictegravir and other INIs in HIV-2-infected individuals and\nmight enable the development of bictegravir resistance in HIV-2 patients\nwho are INI naive (i.e., who are not pretreated with an INI-containing\nregimen before receiving bictegravir-based ART).\n\nIt is also possible that other, noncanonical changes in HIV-2 integrase\ncan lead to clinical resistance to bictegravir. For instance, amino acid\ninsertions at position 231 emerged in a subset of HIV-2 patients during\nINI-based treatment, and HIV-2 isolates containing these insertions\nexhibited low-level cross-resistance to bictegravir in culture ( 34 ).\nSimilar insertions were reported in an SIV ~mac251~ -infected rhesus\nmacaque that was treated with long-acting cabotegravir ( 53 ) and in an\nHIV-2-infected patient who received raltegravir followed by\ndolutegravir-based ART ( 54 ). In the future, it will be important to\ndetermine the effects of both established and novel mutations on\nclinical responsiveness to bictegravir, as well as other\nsecond-generation INIs, in larger numbers of HIV-2-infected individuals.\n\nBictegravir is not currently available as a stand-alone INI; it is\ncoformulated with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide in the\nsingle-tablet regimen (STR) Biktarvy. Biktarvy exhibits several\npharmacological properties that are distinct from other STRs; it does\nnot require testing for the *HLA-B\\*5701* polymorphism, and it is safe\nto use in patients with impaired kidney function (with creatinine\nclearance of ≥30 ml/min) ( 31 , 32 ). Through the inclusion of\nemtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, Biktarvy meets the requirements\nfor treatment of HIV-infected patients who are coinfected with hepatitis\nB virus ( 55 ), which represents ∼10% of all people living with HIV in\nWest Africa ( 56 , -- 59 ). Based on findings from our group and others,\nall three antiretroviral components of Biktarvy are fully active against\nHIV-2 *in vitro* ( 19 , 60 , -- 63 ), although we emphasize that\npublished information regarding the use of tenofovir alafenamide for\nHIV-2 treatment is limited to five patients ( 54 ). Taken together, the\navailable data suggest that a clinical trial should be performed in West\nAfrica to determine the effectiveness of Biktarvy as first-line ART for\nall HIV-infected individuals, including those infected with HIV-2.\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThese studies were supported by grants to G.S.G. from the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH/NIAID; 2R01-AI060466 and R01-AI120765), the UW Center for AIDS Research (CFAR, an NIH-funded program; P30 AI027757), and the UW Royalty Research Fund (A92723).

We performed phylogenetic reconstructions and revealed two distinct lineages within HIV-2 group A, herein called A1 and A2, presenting non-negligible genetic distances and distinct geographic distributions as A1 is related to coastal Western African countries and A2 to inland Western countries. Estimated early diversification times for groups A and B in human populations were 1940 [95% higher probability densitiy: 1935--53] and 1961 [1952--70]. A1 experienced an early diversification in 1942 [1937--58] with two distinct early epidemics in Guinea-Bissau or Senegal, raising the possibility of group A emergence in those countries from an initial introduction from Ivory-Coast to Senegal, two former French colonies. Changes in effective population sizes over time revealed that A1 exponentially grew concomitantly to Guinea-Bissau independence war, but both A2 and B lineages experienced a latter growth, starting during the 80s economic crisis.

Since thymidine\nanalog-associated mutations (TAMs) in HIV-1 confer reduced TFV\nsusceptibility, patients with TAM-containing HIV-1 may benefit from\nhigher TFV-DP levels delivered by TAF. Moreover, the presence of the\nM184V mutation increases TFV susceptibility during TDF- or TAF-based\ntherapy. The susceptibilities to antiviral drugs of site-directed\nmutants (SDMs) and patient-derived mutants containing combinations of\nTAMs (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y, and K219Q) with or without the\nM184V mutation (TAMs±M184V) were evaluated using either 5-day multicycle\n(MC; *n* = 110) or 2-day single-cycle (SC; *n* = 96) HIV assays. The\npresence of M184V in TAM-containing HIV-1 SDMs ( *n* = 48) significantly\nincreased TAF sensitivity compared to SDMs without M184V ( *n* = 48).\nThe comparison of TAF and TDF resistance profiles was further assessed\nin viral breakthrough (VB) experiments mimicking clinically relevant\ndrug concentrations. A total of 68 mutants were assayed at physiological\nconcentration in VB experiments, with 15/68 mutants breaking through\nwith TDF (TFV, the *in vitro* equivalent of TDF, was used in these\nexperiments), and only 3 of 68 mutants breaking through under TAF\ntreatment. Overall, in the VB assay mimicking the 4-fold-higher\nintracellular levels of TFV-DP observed clinically with TAF versus TDF,\nTAF inhibited viral breakthrough of most TAM-containing HIV-1, whereas\nTDF did not. These results indicate that TAF has a higher resistance\nthreshold than TDF and suggest that higher resistance cutoffs should be\napplied for TAF compared to TDF in genotypic and phenotypic resistance\nalgorithms.\n\n**KEYWORDS:** HIV-1, M184V, TAF, antiretroviral resistance, tenofovir\nalafenamide, thymidine analog-associated mutations, TAMs\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Phenotypic characterization of recombinant viruses.\n\nSingle-cycle phenotypic 50% effective concentration (EC ~50~ ) assays\nwith TAF and AZT were performed with the SDMs (see the supplemental\nmaterial). While a high level of reduced susceptibility to the control\ndrug AZT was observed, ranging from 0.5- to \\>350-fold above the\nwild-type control as expected, reduced susceptibility to TAF was\nmoderate and ranged from 1.3- to 5.5-fold above the wild-type control (\nTable 1 and Fig. 1 ), with most fold changes (FC) of ≥1.8 (27 of 42)\nshowing a statistical difference from the wild type ( *P* \\< 0.05, *t*\ntest). The addition of M184V in viruses with one to two TAMs had only a\nmarginal effect on susceptibility to TAF (1.2-fold increase); however,\nthe presence of M184V in viruses with ≥3 TAMs increased virus\nsusceptibility to TAF by an average of 2-fold ( *P* \\< 0.01; paired *t*\ntest comparing fold change in viruses with ≥3 TAMs with or without\nM184V). Though stronger in magnitude, a similar effect was noted for AZT\nin the presence of M184V, with an increase in susceptibility to AZT of\n7.3-fold in mutants with one to three TAMs ( *P* \\< 0.01; paired *t*\ntest comparing fold change in viruses with or without M184V) and of\n26-fold in mutants with four to six TAMs ( *P* \\< 0.01). Comparison of\nthe in-house single-cycle EC ~50~ data to data from the commercial\nsingle-cycle EC ~50~ assay from Monogram Biosciences (PhenoSense) for 30\nviruses tested with TAF showed a good correlation between the two\nassays, with moderately higher fold changes obtained in the in-house\nassay ( Fig. 2 ).\n\nFIG 1\n\nSingle-cycle phenotypic EC ~50~ assays of HIV-1 site-directed mutants\ncontaining TAM±M184V against TAF and AZT. Viruses are grouped by number\nof TAMs with (open circle) or without (filled circle) M184V. Each circle\nrepresents a single virus. Mean EC ~50~ -fold changes compared to the\nwild type are shown for each TAM group (mean of ≥3 replicate experiments\nfor each individual virus is indicated by a horizontal black line). The\ndashed line indicates a fold change of 1. Single-cycle antiviral assay\nin MT-2 cells with pKSHX backbone viruses, and 2- and 2.5-fold drug\ndilutions for TAF and AZT, respectively, were incubated for 2 days and\nread using a luciferase assay readout.\n\nFIG 2\n\nComparison of TAF EC ~50~ -fold change (FC) from wild-type between\ncommercial single-cycle phenotypic assay (Monogram Biosciences; *y*\naxis) and internal single-cycle phenotypic assay ( *x* axis). The\ncommercial assay was performed for 30 site-directed mutants with one to\nsix TAMs, with or without M184V, that showed a wide range of FCs in the\ninternal assay. The linear regression parameters were as follows: *R*\n^2^ = 0.69 and *y* = 0.36 *x* + 0.35.\n\nMulticycle phenotypic EC ~50~ assays with NRTIs and control compounds\nwere performed on SDMs and patient-derived clinical isolates. For SDMs,\na gradual increase in resistance to TAF, TFV, and AZT was observed with\nincreasing numbers of TAMs, with fold changes above wild-type control\nranging from 0.3 to 4.0, 0.4 to 4.8, and 0.2 to \\> 91 for TAF, TFV, and\nAZT, respectively. Fold changes of ≤0.5 and ≥ 1.5 for TAF, ≤0.4 and ≥1.6\nfor TFV, and ≤0.3 and ≥1.7 for AZT were statistically different from\nwild-type ( *P* \\< 0.05, *t* test), indicating the robustness of the\nassay to detect drug hypersusceptibility and low-level resistance. In\nthe presence of M184V, lower levels of resistance were observed for all\nthree drugs, with both TAF and TFV showing a statistically significant\n1.5-fold increased drug susceptibility in viruses with one to six TAMs (\n*P* \\< 0.01, paired *t* test comparing fold changes in viruses with or\nwithout M184V), and AZT showing an average 7.8-fold increase in\nsusceptibility in the presence of M184V in viruses with TAMs ( *P* \\<\n0.01, paired *t* test comparing fold changes in viruses with or without\nM184V) ( Table 2 and Fig. 3 ). Resistance to ABC and FTC in the presence\nof TAMs increased overall gradually up to four TAMs, with fold changes\nfrom the wild type ranging from 0.3 to 9.4 for ABC and from 0.2 to 6.9\nfor FTC in the absence of M184V and from 1.5 to 13.6 for ABC and no\nantiviral activity noted for FTC in the presence of M184V (FC \\> 126).\nAll ABC fold changes of ≥1.5 and FTC fold changes of ≥1.9 were\nsignificantly different from the wild type ( *P* \\< 0.05, *t* test). The\npresence of M184V increased resistance to ABC by 2.6-fold overall across\nall SDMs ( *P* \\< 0.01, paired *t* test comparing fold changes in\nviruses with or without M184V) ( Table 2 and Fig. 3 ). Resistance levels\nwere higher for patient-derived viruses compared to SDMs, likely as a\nresult of the choice of samples used to generate the patient-derived\nisolates, most of which containing TAMs associated with higher levels of\nresistance to TFV (M41L, L210W, and T215Y). Overall, PD viruses followed\na similar trend as the SDMs, with a gradual increase in FC with\nincreasing number of TAMs (isolates with three to five TAMs were tested)\nfor TAF, TFV, AZT, and ABC ( Table 3 ). Fold changes compared to the\nwild type ranged from 0.9 to 12.6 for TAF ( *P* \\< 0.01 for 13 of 14\nisolates with FC ≥ 1.8), 1.0 to 14.2 for TFV ( *P* \\< 0.05 for 12 of 14\nisolates with FC ≥ 1.6), 5.1 to \\>91 for AZT ( *P* \\< 0.01 for all 14\nisolates), 1.4 to \\>126 for FTC ( *P* \\< 0.01 for 12 of 14 isolates with\nFC ≥ 2.1), and 2.0 to 18.8 for ABC ( *P* \\< 0.01 for all 14 isolates).\nSimilar to SDMs, isolates with M184V showed an increase in\nsusceptibility to TAF, TFV, and AZT and a decrease in susceptibility to\nABC and no antiviral effect noted for FTC. Control compounds (DTG and\nDRV) showed near wild-type levels, reflective of the wild-type sequence\nin these RT mutants for integrase and protease, respectively.\n\n\nFIG 3\n\nMulticycle phenotypic EC ~50~ assays of HIV-1 site-directed mutants\ncontaining TAM±M184V against TAF, TFV, AZT, FTC, and ABC. Multicycle\nantiviral assay in MT-2 cells with pXXLAI backbone viruses and 5-fold\ndrug dilutions were incubated for 5 days, and then the cell viability\nwas measured using a luciferase-based readout (CellTiterGlo). Viruses\nare grouped by number of TAMs with (open circles) or without (filled\ncircles) M184V. Each circle represents a single virus. Mean EC ~50~\n-fold changes compared to the wild type are shown for each TAM group\n(mean of ≥3 replicate experiments for each individual virus is indicated\nby a horizontal black line). The dashed line indicates a fold change of\n1.\n\nSimilar trends were observed between single and multicycle phenotypic EC\n~50~ assays for TAF and AZT ( Fig. 1 and ​ and3). 3 ). An increase in the\nnumber of TAMs led to decreased susceptibility to the drugs, and the\naddition of M184V increased the virus susceptibility to drug in both\nsingle-cycle and multicycle phenotypic EC ~50~ assays.\n\nTAF and TFV fold changes in the multicycle EC ~50~ assay were strongly\ncorrelated ( *R* ^2^ = 0.93, Fig. 4 ). These results were expected since\nTAF and TFV both lead to the same active moiety (TFV-DP) that is\nresponsible for the antiviral effect with both drugs. However, these *in\nvitro* phenotypic EC ~50~ assays measure drug inhibition in a\nnonphysiological model system that does not reproduce the complex\npharmacological events (drug loading, metabolism, elimination, etc.)\nassociated with the \\>4-fold increase in intracellular TFV-DP loading\nachieved physiologically with TAF compared to TFV/TDF. We evaluated the\neffect of the higher TFV-DP concentration achieved physiologically with\nTAF in comparison to TFV/TDF by assessing the growth of TAM-containing\nmutants at physiological concentrations of TAF and TFV in the viral\nbreakthrough assay described below.\n\nFIG 4\n\nComparison of TAF and TDF EC ~50~ -fold change (FC) from the wild type\nin the multicycle phenotypic assay. All 110 pXXLAI backbone viruses\ncontaining TAMs±M184V (96 site-directed mutants + 14 patient-derived\nisolates) are plotted. The linear regression parameters are as follows:\n*R* ^2^ = 0.93 and *y* = 1.04 *x* -- 0.006. \\*, TFV, the *in vitro*\nequivalent of TDF, was used in these experiments.\n\n### Viral breakthrough assays.\n\nMT-2 cells were incubated with concentrations of TAF (0.8 μM) or TFV\n(50 μM) that mimicked physiological concentrations *in vivo* and were\ninfected with various SDMs or patient isolates ( 8 ). A total of 68\nviruses with various levels of TAF/TDF resistance and various numbers of\nTAMs were used in the viral breakthrough experiments (54 SDMs and 14\npatient-derived isolates). Of the 68 viruses tested, 15 viruses broke\nthrough with TFV/TDF, with only 3/15 also breaking through with TAF (\nFig. 5 ). The 15 viruses that broke through with TDF contained three or\nmore TAMs (with or without M184V), with TAF fold changes ranging from\n1.9 to 12.6 ( Table 4 ). In contrast, the only three viruses that broke\nthrough with TAF contained five TAMs, and their TAF fold changes ranged\nfrom 6.6 to 12.6. These data indicate that TAF has a higher resistance\nthreshold compared to TDF at concentrations mimicking physiological\nconcentrations.\n\nFIG 5\n\nViral breakthrough of selected viruses ( *n* = 68, see the supplemental\nmaterial) in the presence of physiological concentrations of TAF and\nTDF. MT-2 cells were incubated overnight with either TDF or TAF at\nconcentrations reflective of *in vivo* loading achieved with the two\nprodrugs of TFV (TDF, 50 μM \\[1×EC ~95~ corresponding to an IQ ~95~ =\n1\\]; TAF, 0.8 μM \\[4×EC ~95~ corresponding to an IQ ~95~ = 4\\]) and\ninfected with HIV-1 mutants. Mutant viruses tested (each represented by\na circle) are plotted against the TAF EC ~50~ -fold changes measured for\nthe mutants. \\*, TFV, the *in vitro* equivalent of TDF, was used in\nthese experiments.\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nWe conducted experiments with the aim of gaining a better understanding\nof the resistance profile of TAF (the second-generation prodrug of TFV)\nin comparison with TDF (first-generation prodrug of TFV). Since\ntreatment with TAF leads to a \\>4-fold increase in the PBMC\nintracellular concentration of the anti-HIV active moiety TFV-DP\ncompared to treatment with TDF ( 10 , 11 ), we hypothesized that the\nresistance threshold for TAF should be higher than for TDF.\n\nHere, we established the *in vitro* resistance profile of TAF and TDF in\nphenotypic assays using 110 viruses containing TAMs in the presence or\nabsence of M184V. We showed that *in vitro* both TAF and TDF have\nvirtually the same resistance profile (1-to-1 correlation, Fig. 4 ),\nwhich was expected since both prodrugs lead to the same active moiety\n(TFV-DP). However, standard *in vitro* phenotypic assays do not capture\nthe \\>4-fold increase in intracellular TFV-DP concentration obtained\nwith TAF dosing compared to TDF *in vivo* . This limitation was overcome\nby performing viral breakthrough assays at physiologically relevant\nconcentrations of TAF and TDF that mimicked the \\>4-fold increase of\nTFV-DP that TAF provides compared to TDF *in vivo* . In these assays,\nthe 15 viruses that broke through with TFV/TDF contained three or more\nTAMs with phenotypic resistance of ≥1.9-fold resistance, while the 3\nviruses that broke through with TAF contained five TAMs with phenotypic\nresistance of ≥6.6-fold resistance, similar to previously published\nfindings ( 8 ). This suggests that the resistance threshold for TAF may\nbe 3.5-fold (ratio of 6.6 to 1.9) higher than for TDF and that TAF can\ninhibit resistant viruses that carry up to four TAMs in the absence of\nM184V. The pharmacologic enhancement of TAF compared to TDF that leads\nto higher *in vivo* intracellular concentration of TFV-DP is a clear\ndifferentiation factor between the two prodrugs of TFV, and these\nfindings should be factored into the genotypic and phenotypic algorithms\nused to estimate the level of drug resistance, which we have shown to be\ndifferent between TAF and TDF. This pharmacological effect is analogous\nto the increased atazanavir (ATV) drug levels obtained in patients upon\npharmacological boosting with ritonavir (RTV) ( 19 ), which led to the\nestablishment of different resistance cutoffs for ATV compared to\nRTV-boosted ATV (2.2 and 5.2, respectively, in the Monogram Biosciences\nassay). Furthermore, we did not observe viral breakthrough of SDM\nviruses with up to six TAMs in the presence of M184V, suggesting that\nthe known hypersusceptibility to TAF and TFV associated with the\ndecreased RT processivity and viral fitness in the presence of M184V (\n20 ) also contributes to the higher resistance threshold for TAF and\nshould be taken into account when predicting treatment response to TAF\nclinically.\n\nClinical validation of the higher resistance threshold for TAF compared\nto TDF has not been established, since doing so would knowingly put\nparticipants at risk of virologic failure and would be inconsistent with\nthe current standard of care. However, evidence suggesting that TAF may\nbe active against NRTI-resistant HIV in the clinic have been obtained in\ntwo clinical studies investigating virologically suppressed patients\nwith NRTI resistance (including TAMs). One ongoing study\n(GS-US-292-1824) has enrolled treatment-experienced (TE) patients with\nhistorical evidence of the presence of M184V/I with or without one to\ntwo TAMs who switched to the single tablet regimen composed of\nelvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/TAF (E/C/F/TAF). Participants in\nthat study experienced 100% efficacy (pure virologic failure algorithm)\nin maintaining viral suppression up to week 24 (latest time point\navailable) ( 21 ). The other study (GS-US-292-0119) enrolled suppressed\nheavily TE patients with known HIV resistance mutations, including a\nnumber of patients with three TAMs (23 of 135). In that study, patients\nswitched from a complex regimen containing multiple pills to a\nsimplified regimen of DRV plus E/C/F/TAF or stayed on their baseline\nregimen. Switching to DRV + E/C/F/TAF was found to be superiorly\nefficacious through week 48 (94% success at maintaining viral\nsuppression below detectable level) compared to staying on baseline\nregimen ( 22 , -- 24 ). Taken together, the high efficacy data observed\nin these studies suggests that TAF is likely playing an active role in\nsuppressing the virus in these treatment-experienced patients with HIV\nharboring TAMs and other mutations, including M184V.\n\nIn conclusion, the data presented here have shown that the \\>4-fold\nincrease in intracellular TFV-DP concentration upon dosing with TAF\ncompared to TDF is associated with an increase in the resistance\nthreshold for TAF compared to TDF. The results suggest that TAF can\ninhibit viruses with up to four TAMs (compared to only up to two TAMs\nwith TDF), which was further increased to six TAMs in the presence of\nthe relatively common M184V mutation. The resistance threshold for TAF\nwas estimated to be 3.5-fold higher than that for TDF. Similar analyses\nwith a large number of K65R-containing viruses are ongoing and will\ncomplement this study (C. Callebaut et al., unpublished data).\nAltogether, these data suggest that algorithmic prediction of clinical\nactivity of TAF should not follow the same rules as TDF and should\nconsider the pharmacological enhancement of intracellular TFV-DP\nconcentration achieved with TAF dosing compared to TDF dosing.\n\n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Reagents.\n\nTAF, TFV, ABC, FTC, dolutegravir (DTG), and darunavir (DRV) were\nsynthesized at Gilead Sciences (Foster City, CA). TFV was used instead\nof TDF in our *in vitro* experiments due to the limitations of the lack\nof stability of TDF in culture media. ZDV was purchased from\nSigma-Aldrich (St. Louis. MO). HEK293T cells (293T cells) used for virus\nproduction were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC;\nManassas, VA). MT-2 cells were obtained from the National Institutes of\nHealth AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Germantown, MD).\n\nThe viral plasmid pXXLAI used to generate the infectious viruses for the\nmulticycle assay was a gift from John Mellors. The plasmid was derived\nfrom the infectious clone pLAI3.2 (GenBank accession number K03455 ),\nwhich was modified to contain an XmaI and an XbaI restriction site\nwithin the HIV RT portion of the *pol* gene to facilitate cloning, as\npreviously published ( 25 ). The viral plasmid pKSHX was used to\ngenerate the single-cycle luciferase reporter viruses for the\nsingle-cycle assay. pKSHX was generated from an NL4.3 vector (GenBank\naccession number AF324493 ) by knocking out *vpr* and *env* expression\nand introducing a luciferase firefly gene in place of *nef* , as\npreviously published under the name pKS13 ( 26 ). This single-cycle\nvirus was pseudotyped with VSV-G ( 27 ).\n\nGlutaMAX RPMI 1640 culture medium, Gibco DMEM high glucose, penicillin\n(10,000 U/ml), streptomycin (10,000 μg/ml), and 100× HEPES were\npurchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). Fetal bovine\nserum (FBS) was purchased from HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Cell\nculture media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 5 ml of\npenicillin (10,000 U/ml) and Streptomycin (10,000 μg/ml) and 5 ml of\n100× HEPES per 500 ml of medium.\n\n### Virus cloning and production.\n\nRecombinant mutant HIV-1 viruses were created either by site directed\nmutagenesis (SDM) of wild-type HIV-1 DNA, or by direct PCR of\nART-experienced patient isolates ( 8 ). DNA fragments containing most\ncombinations of the most frequent TAMs (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y,\nand K219Q in RT) with or without the M184V RT mutation were generated by\nSDM and cloned into both pKSHX and pXXLAI plasmids (Genewiz, South\nPlainfield, NJ) (see the supplemental material). Plasmid DNA was\ntransfected into 293T cells using the transfection reagent TransIT-LT1\n(Mirus Bio Corporation, Madison, WI). For pXXLAI plasmid transfection,\n7 μg of the pXXLAI vector was transfected in 2 million 293T cells seeded\nin T-25 cell culture flasks in a 6-ml volume. Virus was harvested at 24\nand at 48 h posttransfection and then combined and used for infectivity\nassays. For pKSHX plasmid transfection, 35 μg of the pKSHX vector and\n8 μg of the envelope vector pCMV-VSVG were transfected in 12 million\n293T cells seeded in T-225 cell culture flasks in a 46-ml volume.\nCulture medium was replaced with fresh media after 5 to 6 h. Virus was\nharvested at 24 h posttransfection.\n\n### Multicycle phenotypic assay.\n\nThe phenotype of each virus was determined in a 5-day multicycle\nantiviral assay in MT-2 cells using a luciferase-based viability readout\n(CellTiterGlo; Promega, Madison, WI), as previously described ( 28 ).\nBriefly, MT-2 cells (2.4 million) were incubated with virus for 2 to 3 h\nat 37°C in 1.5-ml screw-cap tubes with gentle rocking. The amount of\nvirus used was normalized to yield a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio in the\nrange of 4 to 7, which was equivalent to a multiplicity of infection of\n0.005 based on the provided titer for the commercially available\nwild-type isolate HIV-1 ~IIIB~ . The S/N ratio was calculated from the\n300 nM DTG control (200-fold EC ~50~ ; maximum cell survival) and the\nno-drug control (minimum cell survival). Black Corning assay plates (96\nwell; Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) were prepared with 5-fold\ndilutions of the drugs of interest in triplicate. Drug concentrations\ntested were as follows: TAF, 1 μM to 0.16 nM; TFV ( *in vitro*\nequivalent of TDF), 300 μM to 48 nM; AZT, 15 μM to 2.4 nM; ABC, 20 μM to\n6.4 nM; FTC, 50 μM to 16 nM; DTG, 188 to 0.06 nM; and DRV, 630 to\n0.2 nM. After a 3-h incubation, infected MT-2 cells were diluted 1:14 to\na concentration of 0.17 million cells/ml with tissue culture medium.\nThen, 50 μl of cell suspension was transferred to all wells in the assay\nplates to a final concentration of 8,500 cells/well. After 5 days of\nincubation (37°C, 5% CO ~2~ , 95% humidity), cultures were resuspended,\n100 μl of CellTiterGlo reagent was added to each well, and the\nluminescence was measured using an Envision plate reader (Perkin-Elmer,\nShelton, CT). The percent inhibition in the drug-containing wells in\ncomparison to the fully protected DTG control were plotted using Excel\n(Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and XL Fit (IDBS, Alameda, CA), and the\nassociated effective concentration to inhibit 50% of viral replication\n(EC ~50~ ) was calculated. The statistical significance ( *P* \\< 0.05)\nof the fold changes for the mutants compared to the wild-type control\nwas calculated using Excel (two-tailed Student *t* test).\n\n### Single-cycle phenotypic assay.\n\nThe phenotype of each isolate was determined in a single-cycle 2-day\nantiviral assay in MT-2 cells using a luciferase-assay readout\n(Bright-Glo; Promega). MT-2 cells were plated in triplicate, along with\npKSHX virus and diluted drug. The pKSHX vector contains a reporter\nluciferase gene (in place of *nef* ), which was used to measure the\nquantity of virus produced. The optimal volume of pKSHX virus to use was\ndetermined in a virus titration assay with the goal to yield a readout\nbetween 10 and 40 million relative light units (RLU). The S/N ratio was\ncalculated from the virus control in the absence of inhibitor (maximum\nluminescence signal) and the no-virus well control (minimum luminescence\nsignal). White Corning assay plates (96 well; Fisher Scientific) were\nprepared with 50-μl dilutions of the virus and the drugs of interest in\ntriplicate. TAF concentrations ranged from 7 μM to 0.013 nM with 2-fold\ndilutions. AZT concentrations ranged from 7.5 mM to 0.21 nM with\n2.5-fold dilutions. MT-2 cells were diluted in culture medium, and\n20,000 cells/well were added to the assay plates in a volume of 100 μl.\n\nAfter 2 days of incubation (37°C, 5% CO ~2~ , 95% humidity), the cells\nwere resuspended, 75 μl of Bright-Glo reagent was added to each well,\nand the luminescence was measured using an Envision plate reader\n(Perkin-Elmer). Viral infection luminescence signals in the\ndrug-containing wells were plotted using Prism 7 (GraphPad Software,\nInc., La Jolla, CA), and the EC ~50~ was calculated. The statistical\nsignificance ( *P* \\< 0.05) of the fold changes for the mutants compared\nto the wild-type control was calculated using Excel (two-tailed Student\n*t* test).\n\nThirty viruses containing one to six TAMs with or without M184V covering\na wide FC range were selected and tested with Monogram Biosciences'\n(South San Francisco, CA) phenotypic EC ~50~ assay (PhenoSense) in order\nto compare the data obtained from both single-cycle assays.\n\n### Drug loading in viral breakthrough assay.\n\nThe viral breakthrough experiments were conducted as previously\npublished ( 8 , 29 ). MT-2 cells at a concentration of 0.4 million\ncells/ml were incubated (37°C, 5% CO ~2~ , 95% humidity) in the presence\nof TAF or TFV for 24 h at concentrations corresponding to TAF and TDF\nclinical exposure expressed as multiples of the EC ~95~ for each drug\n(with EC ~95~ estimated at 10×EC ~50~ ). Cells were loaded with three\nTFV concentrations corresponding to inhibitory quotient (IQ)\nequivalents: 25 μM (0.5×EC ~95~ corresponding to an IQ ~95~ = 0.5),\n50 μM (1×EC ~95~ corresponding to an IQ ~95~ = 1), and 100 μM (2×EC ~95~\ncorresponding to an IQ ~95~ = 2). For TAF, the concentrations used were\nadjusted to reflect the 4-fold increase in the intracellular\nconcentration of TFV-DP observed *in vivo* upon dosing with TAF compared\nto dosing with TDF ( 10 , 11 ). As a result, the three TAF\nconcentrations used to load the cells were as follows: 0.4 μM (2×EC ~95~\ncorresponding to an IQ ~95~ = 2), 0.8 μM (4×EC ~95~ corresponding to an\nIQ ~95~ = 4), and 1.6 μM (8×EC ~95~ corresponding to an IQ ~95~ = 8).\nCells loaded with either no drug or 300 nM dolutegravir (∼200×EC ~50~ )\nplus 100 nM efavirenz (∼100×EC ~50~ ) were set up as controls.\n\n### Viral breakthrough assay.\n\nAs previously described ( 8 , 29 ), tubes containing virus with 0.4\nmillion MT-2 cells from each drug loading condition were incubated with\ngentle rocking at 37°C for 3 h. The amount of virus used was determined\nfrom the phenotypic EC ~50~ assays to give an S/N value between 4 and 7.\nInfected cells were then plated at 10,000 cells per well in 96-well\nplates containing a final volume of 200 μl of cell culture medium with\nthe same drug concentrations that were used at the loading step.\nInfections were scored after 4 or 5 days of incubation (37°C, 5% CO ~2~\n, 95% humidity). Cultures were inspected under the microscope for signs\nof virus-induced cytopathic effect associated with viral breakthrough.\nNew passages were carried out by transferring 50 μl of cells to new\nplates containing 150 μl of fresh medium with the appropriate drug\nconcentrations. This process was repeated every 4 to 5 days up to\n4 weeks.\n\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nAll authors are employees and stockholders of Gilead Sciences, Inc., which funded the study.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 37185867\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \" Abstract\n\nTenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a prodrug of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor tenofovir (TFV). Compared to the earlier TFV prodrug, TFV disoproxil fumarate (TDF), TAF achieves more than fourfold‐higher intracellular levels of its active metabolite TFV diphosphate (TFV‐DP) in clinical studies, while achieving a significant reduction of TFV systemic exposure. Resistance to TFV has been well established, with the K65R mutation in RT as the signature mutation. Here we evaluated the in vitro activity of TAF and TDF in patient‐derived HIV‐1 isolates harboring the K65R mutation. Clinical isolates containing K65R were cloned into the pXXLAI construct (n = 42). In vitro phenotypic susceptibility of the constructs to TAF and TDF was evaluated in an MT‐2 cell HIV assay and in viral breakthrough assays modeling physiological concentrations of TAF and TDF. TAF and TDF susceptibility were highly correlated in K65R‐containing mutants, ranging from 2.7‐ to 3.0‐fold (K65R alone) and 1.2‐ to 27.6‐fold (K65R+ other RT mutations) relative to wild‐type. In viral breakthrough assays mimicking differences in physiological concentrations, TAF inhibited breakthrough of 40 of 42 clinical isolates, while the TDF equivalent only inhibited 32 of 42 isolates tested. TAF displayed a higher barrier to resistance than TDF in this panel of K65R‐containing clinical isolates.\"\nRationale: The paper reports in vitro drug susceptibility data by evaluating the phenotypic susceptibility of patient-derived HIV-1 isolates to TAF and TDF.

TAF is currently in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination with other antiretroviral agents.

Both DTG and BIC\npotently inhibit most INSTI-resistant IN mutants selected by the INSTIs\nraltegravir (RAL) and elvitegravir (EVG). BIC has not been reported to\nselect for resistance in treatment-naive patients, and DTG has selected\nfor a small number of resistant viruses in treatment-naive patients.\nHowever, some patients who had viruses with substitutions selected by\nRAL and EVG responded poorly when switched to DTG-based therapies, and\nthere are mutants that cause a considerable decrease in the potencies of\nDTG and BIC in *in vitro* assays. The new INSTI cabotegravir (CAB),\nwhich is in late-stage clinical trials, has been shown to select for\nnovel resistant mutants *in vitro* . Thus, it is important to develop\nnew and improved INSTIs that are effective against all the known\nresistant mutants. This led us to test our best inhibitors, in parallel\nwith DTG, BIC, and CAB, in a single-round infection assay against a\npanel of the new CAB-resistant mutants. Of the INSTIs we tested, BIC and\nour compound 4d had the broadest efficacy. Both were superior to DTG, as\nevidenced by the data obtained with the IN mutant\nT66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/Q148R/S230N, which was selected by CAB using an\nEVG-resistant lab strain. These results support the preclinical\ndevelopment of compound 4d and provide information that can be used in\nthe design of additional INSTIs that will be effective against a broad\nspectrum of resistant mutants.\n\n**KEYWORDS:** drug resistance, human immunodeficiency virus, inhibitor,\nintegrase, replication capacity\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Comparison of antiviral potencies against a panel of mutants selected by CAB.\n\nCAB is a structural analog of DTG and BIC that we previously showed is\ninferior to both DTG and BIC in terms of its ability to inhibit a large\npanel of INSTI-resistant mutant HIV strains ( 16 ). Recent *in vitro*\nselection studies identified several new mutants that are resistant to\nCAB when *in vitro* selections were initiated with a Q148H/K/R mutant\nvirus ( 22 ). The majority of the new resistant mutants were identified\nin cell culture experiments in which the starting IN mutant was Q148H.\nHowever, a small number of resistant mutants were identified starting\nwith Q148K and Q148R mutant viruses. Most of the new mutants had changes\nat more than one secondary position. The L74 and V75 amino acid\nsubstitutions are located within ∼5.0 Å of the metal ions bound at the\nIN active site, while T122 is farther away (∼13.0 Å). The Q148H mutant\nis often accompanied by the G140S substitution, which is a well-known\ncompensatory substitution, and by additional substitutions at secondary\npositions. We determined the antiviral potencies of DTG, BIC, CAB, and\nour INSTIs against the following INSTI-resistant IN mutants that were\nselected by CAB *in vitro* : L74M/Q148R, V75A/G140S/Q148H,\nT122N/G140S/Q148H, and L74M/V75A/G140S/Q148H ( Fig. 2 ; see Table S1 in\nthe supplemental material).\n\nFIG 2\n\nComparison of antiviral potencies against a panel of INSTI-resistant\nmutants selected *in vitro* using CAB. The EC ~50~ values were\ndetermined for the clinically relevant INSTIs and compounds using\nvectors that carry INSTI-resistant double, triple, and quadruple mutants\nin a single-round infection assay, up to a maximum concentration of\n100 nM. Asterisks denote EC ~50~ values that are greater than 100 nM.\nThe error bars represent standard deviations of independent experiments,\n*n* = 3, performed in triplicate. The potency of the INSTIs and our\ncompounds against WT HIV-1 were previously determined ( 16 , 23 ).\n\nIn order to compare the effectiveness of the INSTIs, we calculated the\nfold change (FC) in the 50% effective concentration (EC ~50~ ) values\nfor the IN mutants versus wild-type (WT) HIV-1. When we compared the\nrelative potencies of our promising INSTIs, we made use of the Monogram\nFC cutoffs for resistance for BIC (2.5) and the two FC cutoffs for DTG\n(4 and 13) ( 17 , 25 ). Because we have three different FCs to choose\nfrom, it is not clear which should be used for our compounds or for CAB.\nFCs below 2.5 are likely to be susceptible, and above 13 are likely to\nbe resistant; however, between 2.5 and 13, the interpretation is more\ndifficult. Differences between the potencies among the INSTIs were\nconsidered significant if the calculated *P* values were \\<0.05.\n\nOverall, compound 4d and BIC were the most potent against this panel of\nCAB-resistant mutants; compound 4d appears to have been slightly better\nthan BIC. Only compound 4d (EC ~50~ , 3.1 ± 0.6 nM; FC, 1.3) retained\nfull potency (FC, \\<2.5) against the L74M/Q148R double mutant, which was\nslightly better than BIC (EC ~50~ , 6.4 ± 1.4 nM; FC, 3.4; *P* \\< 0.05).\nCompound 4f and DTG inhibited the L74M/Q148R double mutant with modestly\nreduced EC ~50~ values (EC ~50~ , 7.3 ± 1.4 nM; FC, 3.7 and EC ~50~ ,\n10.8 ± 2.9 nM; FC, 6.8, respectively). Conversely, the L74M/Q148R double\nmutant caused a minor loss in susceptibility to compound 6p (EC ~50~ ,\n7.2 ± 0.4 nM; FC, 10.3), compound 4c (EC ~50~ , 11.8 ± 2.6 nM; FC, 9.1),\nand compound 6b (EC ~50~ , 14.3 ± 3.8 nM; FC, 10.2) and a major decrease\nin susceptibility to CAB (EC ~50~ , 43.0 ± 11.7 nM; FC, 17.9),\nconfirming the *in vitro* selection studies ( 22 ). The more complex IN\nmutants (defined as having three or more amino acid substitutions),\nwhich comprised the RAL-resistant G140S/Q148H substitutions plus an\nadditional substitution(s) at a secondary position (V75A/G140S/Q148H,\nT122N/G140S/Q148H, and L74M/V75A/G140S/Q148H), reduced the potencies of\nDTG (all FCs, \\>10.0), BIC (all FCs, \\>2.5), CAB (all FCs, \\>17.0), and\nseveral of our INSTIs. However, both compound 4d and BIC were better, in\nterms of their residual potency, against these CAB-resistant mutants.\nCompound 4d inhibited V75A/G140S/Q148H, T122N/G140S/Q148H, and\nL74M/V75A/G140S/Q148H with EC ~50~ values of 9.3 ± 1.1 nM (FC, 4.0),\n16.5 ± 2.6 nM (FC, 7.2), and 18.5 ± 3.5 nM (FC, 8.0), respectively,\nwhereas BIC inhibited V75A/G140S/Q148H, T122N/G140S/Q148H, and\nL74M/V75A/G140S/Q148H with EC ~50~ values of 9.7 ± 1.6 nM (FC, 5.1),\n14.3 ± 3.7 nM (FC, 7.5), and 21.7 ± 2.5 nM (FC, 11.4), respectively.\nBoth DTG and compound 4c also showed reduced potencies against\nV75A/G140S/Q148H (EC ~50~ , 17.2 ± 1.0 nM and FC, 10.8; EC ~50~ ,\n19.4 ± 3.0 nM and FC, 14.9, respectively). When tested against\nV75A/G140S/Q148H, CAB (EC ~50~ , 66.4 ± 14.2 nM; FC, 27.7), compound 4f\n(EC ~50~ , 91.6 ± 12.6 nM; FC, 45.8), compound 6b (EC ~50~ ,\n46.3 ± 4.3 nM; FC, 33.1), and compound 6p (EC ~50~ , 85.8 ± 10.4 nM;\nFC, 122.6) lost considerable potency. In addition, DTG and CAB and\ncompounds 4c, 4f, 6b, and 6p lost potency (EC ~50~ values, \\>29.0 nM;\nall FCs, \\>22.9) against the T122N/G140S/Q148H and L74M/V75A/G140S/Q148H\nresistant mutants. The results of these single-round infection assays\nreinforce the idea that there are complex IN mutants with three or four\namino acid substitutions that cause a significant loss of potency\nagainst the recently approved INSTIs as well as some of our\nnaphthyridine-scaffold compounds.\n\n### Comparison of antiviral potencies against a second panel of INSTI-resistant triple and quadruple mutants that were selected by CAB.\n\nAs described above, passage of a virus that carried the Q148H\nsubstitution in the presence of CAB led to selection of G140S ( 22 ).\nThis is not surprising, since the G140S substitution is compensatory to\nQ148H, which arises in response to partial loss of IN function ( 11 , 26\n). The G140S/Q148H double mutant is a signature RAL-resistant mutant ( 9\n) that also arises in response to treatment with the latest FDA-approved\nINSTIs. Additional passage in the presence of CAB selected two new\nsecondary substitutions, C56S and G149A, which are within approximately\n18.5 Å and 11.5 Å, respectively, of the metal ions bound at the IN\nactive site and were reported not to enhance the fitness of the virus in\ncultured cells ( 23 ). We tested DTG, BIC, CAB, and our inhibitors\nagainst the new accessory amino acid substitutions C56S and G149A alone\nand against the complex mutant C56S/G140S/Q148H/G149A ( Fig. 3 ; Table\nS2). Two additional mutants, G140S/G149A and C56S/G140S/Q148H, were also\nprepared and tested. The IN mutants C56S, G149A, and G140S/G149A were\nall susceptible to DTG, BIC, CAB, and to the INSTIs that we developed.\nThe EC ~50~ values were \\<5.2 nM against C56S, and FCs were \\<2.1 for\nclinically relevant INSTIs and compound 4d. The EC ~50~ values were\n\\<6.1 nM against G149A, and the FCs were \\<2.2 for clinically relevant\nINSTIs and compounds 4c, 4d, and 4f. Lastly, the EC ~50~ values were\n\\<3.4 nM against G140S/G149A, and the FCs were \\<2.4 for all INSTIs. The\nC56S/G140S/Q148H mutant caused a substantial reduction in susceptibility\nto CAB (EC ~50~ , 36.7 ± 5.7 nM; FC, 15.2), compound 6b (EC ~50~ ,\n44.4 ± 11.8 nM; FC, 31.7), and compound 6p (EC ~50~ , 57.5 ± 0.9 nM;\nFC, 82.1) and caused a very significant drop in susceptibility to\ncompound 4f (EC ~50~ , 229.0 ± 21.0 nM; FC, 114.5). However, DTG (EC\n~50~ , 11.3 ± 1.3 nM; FC, 7.1), BIC (EC ~50~ , 7.6 ± 1.1 nM; FC, 4.0),\nand compound 4d (EC ~50~ , 10.3 ± 1.2 nM; FC, 4.5) retained most of\ntheir potency against this IN mutant. With this set of mutants, BIC was\nsuperior to both DTG and compound 4d ( *P* \\< 0.05). As previously shown\n( 27 ), the complex IN mutant G140S/Q148H/G149A causes drops in\nsusceptibility against all of the INSTIs we tested. DTG (EC ~50~ ,\n107.8 ± 9.7 nM; FC, 67.4), CAB (EC ~50~ , 197.0 ± 27.6 nM; FC, 82.1),\ncompound 4f (EC ~50~ , 1,346.7 ± 232.9 nM; FC, 673.4), compound 6b (EC\n~50~ , 428.5 ± 60.9 nM; FC, 306.1), and compound 6p (EC ~50~ ,\n167.8 ± 23.9 nM; FC, 239.7) did not effectively inhibit this IN mutant.\nCompound 4c exhibited a substantial loss of potency (EC ~50~ ,\n58.7 ± 3.3 nM; FC, 15.1), whereas BIC (EC ~50~ , 25.6 ± 2.4 nM; FC, 4.0)\nand compound 4d (EC ~50~ , 15.3 ± 1.1 nM; FC, 4.5) showed more modest\nlosses of potency. The complex IN mutant C56S/G140S/Q148H/G149A caused a\nsubstantial reduction in the potencies of the majority of the INSTIs.\nCompounds 4f (EC ~50~ , 768.6 ± 67.2 nM; FC, 384.3), 6b (EC ~50~ ,\n298.2 ± 24.6 nM; FC, 213.0), and 6p (EC ~50~ , 125.6 ± 15.6 nM;\nFC, 179.4), CAB (EC ~50~ , 127.0 ± 0.9 nM; FC, 52.9), and compound 4c\n(EC ~50~ , 53.0 ± 7.4 nM; FC, 40.8) were ineffective at inhibiting this\nmutant. The mutant caused a loss of potency for DTG (EC ~50~ ,\n44.8 ± 8.2 nM; FC, 28.0) and a somewhat smaller reduction in potency for\ncompound 4d (EC ~50~ , 27.4 ± 3.1 nM; FC, 11.9). BIC, which showed some\nloss of potency (EC ~50~ , 18.8 ± 0.5 nM; FC, 9.9), was the most potent\ninhibitor against this IN mutant compared to the best of our INSTIs,\ncompound 4d ( *P* \\< 0.05); however, compound 4d was superior to DTG (\n*P* \\< 0.05). Considering the data for all the mutants in this panel,\nBIC was the best performer; however, compound 4d was only slightly\ninferior. In contrast, CAB had severe deficiencies inhibiting the\nmutants in this panel. Its best EC ~50~ value, against the\nINSTI-resistant triple mutant C56S/G140S/Q148H, was 36.7 ± 5.7 nM\n(FC, 15.2). The INSTIs compounds 4f, 6b, and 6p also had problems\nretaining potency against the complex INSTI-resistant mutants in this\npanel.\n\nFIG 3\n\nComparison of antiviral potencies against a panel of INSTI-resistant\nmutants selected *in vitro* using CAB. The EC ~50~ values were\ndetermined for the clinically relevant INSTIs and compounds using\nvectors that carry INSTI-resistant single, double, triple, and quadruple\nmutants in a single-round infection assay, up to a maximum concentration\nof 100 nM. Asterisks denote EC ~50~ values that are greater than 100 nM.\nThe error bars represent standard deviations of independent experiments,\n*n* = 3, performed in triplicate. The potency of the INSTIs and our\ncompounds against WT HIV-1 were previously reported ( 16 , 23 ).\n\n### Comparison of antiviral potencies against a panel of INSTI-resistant quadruple mutants selected by CAB from clinical isolates.\n\nRecently, additional attempts to isolate HIV mutants against DTG, BIC,\nand CAB were reported ( 24 ). Clinical isolates were treated with DTG,\nBIC, and CAB; however, only CAB selected new mutants,\nL74M/E138K/Q148R/R263K and L74M/G140S/S147G/Q148K. We determined the\neffects of the L74M/E138K/Q148R/R263K mutant on the potencies of BIC,\nDTG, CAB, and the INSTIs that we developed ( Fig. 4 ; Table S3). The\nquadruple mutant caused an extensive drop in potency against CAB (EC\n~50~ , 104.9 ± 22.5 nM; FC, 43.7), confirming the results of the\nselection studies. Compound 4f (EC ~50~ , 151.3 ± 19.1 nM; FC, 75.7)\nfailed to effectively inhibit this mutant. Both DTG (EC ~50~ ,\n9.0 ± 0.3 nM; FC, 5.6) and BIC (EC ~50~ , 12.9 ± 2.1 nM; FC, 6.8), and\nto a certain extent, compound 4d (EC ~50~ , 18.2 ± 2.3 nM; FC, 7.9),\nretained considerable potency against this complex mutant. The remaining\ncompounds displayed a moderate loss in potency and include 4c (EC ~50~ ,\n22.5 ± 4.7 nM; FC, 17.3), 6b (EC ~50~ , 20.1 ± 3.0 nM; FC, 14.4), and 6p\n(EC ~50~ , 20.0 ± 2.3 nM; FC, 28.6). If we use an FC of 4.0 as a cutoff,\nthis complex IN mutant is resistant to BIC and partially sensitive to\nDTG. Compound 4d was the most potent inhibitor among our INSTIs;\nhowever; it was inferior to both BIC ( *P* \\< 0.05) and DTG ( *P*\n\\< 0.05).\n\nFIG 4\n\nComparison of antiviral potencies against an INSTI-resistant mutant\nselected by CAB using a clinical isolate. The EC ~50~ values were\ndetermined for the clinically relevant INSTIs and compounds using\nvectors that carry INSTI-resistant quadruple mutants in a single-round\ninfection assay, with a maximum concentration of 200 nM. The error bars\nrepresent standard deviations of independent experiments, *n* = 3,\nperformed in triplicate. The potency of the INSTIs and our compounds\nagainst WT HIV-1 were previously determined ( 16 , 23 ).\n\n### Comparison of antiviral potencies against a panel of INSTI-resistant mutants selected by DTG, BIC, and CAB.\n\nAdditional mutants have been selected with DTG, BIC, and CAB using\nrecombinant strains that carried a patient-derived IN with or without\nthe E157Q amino acid substitution ( 24 , 28 ). When the E157Q\nsubstitution was present, the predominant mutant selected by DTG, BIC,\nand CAB was R263K. CAB selected L74I/E138K/G140S/Q148R, and Q95K/Q146R\nwas selected by both DTG and BIC. We tested the ability DTG, CAB, BIC,\nand our INSTIs to inhibit the following IN mutants: L74I, Q146R, E157Q,\nQ95K/Q146R, E157Q/R263K, and L74I/E138K/G140S/Q148R ( Fig. 5 ; Table\nS4). All of the INSTIs potently inhibited the single mutants L74I,\nQ146R, and E157Q with EC ~50~ values of ≤5.0 nM (FCs, \\<3.2 for the\nclinically relevant INSTIs and FCs of \\<4.0 for our INSTIs). There were\nno obvious differences in the antiviral activities of the FDA-approved\nINSTIs and compound 4d against L74I and Q146R except that BIC had a\nmarginally improved efficacy compared to DTG against Q146R ( *P*\n\\< 0.01). However, compound 4d exhibited slightly better potencies\nagainst E157Q than either BIC ( *P* \\< 0.05) or DTG ( *P* \\< 0.01). All\nthe compounds inhibited the double mutants Q95K/Q146R and E157Q/R263K\nwith EC ~50~ values of ≤8.0 nM (FCs of \\< 3.8 for clinically relevant\nINSTIs and FCs of \\<5.9 for our INSTIs). Our findings suggest that E157Q\ndoes not lead to hyper-susceptibility to DTG, nor did we find that\nE157Q/R263K causes a large reduction in susceptibility to DTG, as was\nreported previously ( 28 ). Compound 6p was the most effective INSTI\nagainst Q95K/146R. Compound 6p was better than compound 4d ( *P*\n\\< 0.05), DTG ( *P* \\< 0.05), BIC ( *P* \\< 0.001), and CAB ( *P*\n\\< 0.05). The differences in the potencies of the INSTIs against the\nmutant E157Q/R263K were not significant. However, the complex IN mutant\nL74I/E138K/G140S/Q148R caused a minor decrease in susceptibility to CAB\n(EC ~50~ , 12.9 ± 1.9 nM; FC, 5.4). This mutant also caused a modest\nloss in susceptibility to compound 6p (EC ~50~ , 13.6 ± 0.4 nM;\nFC, 19.4) and a substantial loss of potency for compound 4f (EC ~50~ ,\n40.6 ± 4.2 nM; FC, 20.3). BIC (EC ~50~ , 2.6 ± 0.1 nM; FC, 1.4), DTG (EC\n~50~ , 4.2 ± 0.8 nM; FC, 2.6), and compound 4d (EC ~50~ , 4.5 ± 0.3 nM;\nFC, 2.0) potently inhibited this IN mutant, while compounds 4c (EC ~50~\n, 9.0 ± 1.7 nM; FC, 6.9) and 6b (EC ~50~ , 7.8 ± 0.6 nM; FC, 5.6) showed\nminor losses of potency. The complex IN mutant L74I/E138K/G140S/Q148R\nwas susceptible to BIC, DTG, and compound 4d. The changes in efficacy\nbetween BIC and DTG and the changes between compound 4d and DTG were not\nsignificant. However, there was a significant difference in potency\nbetween BIC and compound 4d ( *P* \\< 0.01), and BIC and DTG were the\nsuperior INSTIs against this complex IN mutant.\n\nFIG 5\n\nComparison of antiviral potencies against a panel of INSTI-resistant\nmutants selected *in vitro* using recombinant strains with a\npatient-derived IN with or without an E157Q substitution. The EC ~50~\nvalues were determined for the clinically relevant INSTIs and compounds\nusing vectors that carry INSTI-resistant single, double, and quadruple\nmutants in a single-round infection assay, with a maximum concentration\nof 50 nM. The error bars represent standard deviations of independent\nexperiments, *n* = 3, performed in triplicate. The potency of the INSTIs\nand our compounds against WT HIV-1 were previously reported ( 16 , 23 ).\n\n### Comparison of antiviral potencies against a panel of INSTI-resistant mutants selected by DTG, BIC, and CAB using EVG-resistant lab strains.\n\nStarting with recombinant EVG-resistant laboratory strains, mutant\nviruses were selected using DTG, BIC, and CAB ( 24 ). Passaging the\nEVG-resistant mutant T66I in the presence of DTG selected for the\ncomplex IN mutant T66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/M154I. In addition, when the\nEVG-resistant mutant T66I/E138K/S147G/Q148R was passaged in the presence\nof DTG, BIC, and CAB, the mutant T66I/E138K/S147G/Q148R/S230N was\nselected by DTG and BIC, and the IN mutant\nT66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/Q148R/S230N was selected by CAB ( 24 ). There is a\nprevious report that S230N is selected by a number of early-stage INSTIs\n( 29 ). We measured the potencies of DTG, BIC, CAB, and our compounds\nagainst the following IN mutants: M154I, S230N, T66I/R263K,\nT66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/M154I, and T66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/Q148R/S230N (\nFig. 6 , Table S5).\n\nFIG 6\n\nComparison of antiviral potencies against a panel of INSTI-resistant\nmutants selected by CAB using EVG-resistant lab strains. The EC ~50~\nvalues were determined for the clinically relevant INSTIs and compounds\nusing vectors that carry INSTI-resistant single, double, and complex\nmutants in a single-round infection assay, with a maximum concentration\nof 100 nM. The asterisk denotes EC ~50~ values that are greater than\n100 nM. The error bars represent standard deviations of independent\nexperiments, *n* = 3, performed in triplicate. The potency of the INSTIs\nand our compounds against WT HIV-1 were previously determined ( 16 , 23\n).\n\nDTG, BIC, CAB, and our compounds all had EC ~50~ values of \\<5.0 nM\nagainst the IN mutants M154I (FCs of \\<1.8 for all INSTIs) and\nT66I/R263K. In a single-round infection assay, all the INSTIs we tested\npotently inhibited the T66I/R263K double mutant, with EC ~50~ values of\n\\<3.0 nM (FCs of \\< 1.9 for all INSTIs). The DTG-resistant mutant S230N\ncaused a minor loss of DTG potency (EC ~50~ , 7.9 ± 1.3 nM; FC, 4.9) and\na similar loss of potency to compound 6b (EC ~50~ , 6.8 ± 0.9 nM;\nFC, 4.9). However, BIC (EC ~50~ , 2.6 ± 0.6 nM; FC, 1.4), CAB (EC ~50~ ,\n3.2 ± 0.5 nM; FC, 1.3), compound 4c (EC ~50~ , 2.4 ± 0.2 nM; FC, 1.8),\ncompound 4d (EC ~50~ , 3.5 ± 0.6 nM; FC, 1.5), compound 4f (EC ~50~ ,\n3.5 ± 0.7 nM; FC, 1.8), and compound 6p (EC ~50~ , 1.7 ± 0.7 nM;\nFC, 2.4) potently inhibited this IN mutant. Both BIC and compound 4d\nwere superior to DTG ( *P* \\< 0.01 and *P* \\< 0.05, respectively);\nhowever, the differences in the efficacies between BIC and compound 4d\nwere not significant. All of the INSTIs were effective inhibitors of the\ncomplex IN mutant T66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/M154I (EC ~50~ , \\<5.0 nM;\nFCs, \\<2.2 for all INSTIs); however, BIC was slightly superior compared\nto compound 6p ( *P* \\< 0.05), compound 4d ( *P* \\< 0.01), and DTG ( *P*\n\\< 0.01), but compound 6p was superior compared to both compound 4d (\n*P* \\< 0.05) and DTG ( *P* \\< 0.01). Conversely, BIC (EC ~50~ ,\n10.3 ± 0.9 nM; FC, 5.4) and compound 4d (EC ~50~ , 12.5 ± 3.0 nM;\nFC, 5.4) were equally potent inhibitors of the complex IN mutant\nT66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/Q148R/S230N. The IN mutant\nT66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/Q148R/S230N caused a substantial loss in the\npotency of DTG (EC ~50~ , 52.7 ± 4.6 nM; FC, 32.9) and compounds 4c (EC\n~50~ , 40.1 ± 4.7 nM; FC, 30.8), 4f (EC ~50~ , 46.7 ± 1.3 nM; FC, 23.4),\nand 6p (EC ~50~ , 39.3 ± 5.8 nM; FC, 56.1). This mutant also caused a\nvery significant loss in susceptibility to CAB (EC ~50~ ,\n182.4 ± 17.7 nM; FC, 76.0) and compound 6b (EC ~50~ , 95.9 ± 5.7 nM;\nFC, 68.5). Both BIC and compound 4d were superior to DTG in terms of\nefficacy against this IN mutant ( *P* \\< 0.01 and *P* \\< 0.001,\nrespectively). The Q148R amino acid substitution arises in response to\ntreatment to both the early and most recent FDA-approved INSTIs ( 16 ,\n17 , 30 , -- 33 ). This suggests that at least part of the loss in\npotency against T66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/Q148R/230N is due to the presence\nof the Q148R substitution.\n\n### Single-round replication of the INSTI-resistant mutants.\n\nINSTI-resistant mutants typically have a reduced ability to replicate.\nIn addition to the INSTI-resistant mutants used in this study ( Fig. 7 ;\nTable S6), we also measured the replication of seven other mutants\n(M50I/R263K, S119R/R263K, T124A/S153Y, M50I/S119R/R263K,\nV72I/E138K/Q148K, G140S/Q148H/G149A, and L74M/G140S/S147G/A148K) whose\neffects on the susceptibility to various INSTIs had been reported\nearlier ( 27 ). The antiviral data for DTG, BIC, and compounds 4c, 4d,\nand 4f against these INSTI-resistant mutants is included in the\nsupplementary data to simplify comparisons (Fig. S1, upper and lower\npanels) ( 27 ). The INSTI-resistant single mutants C56S, L74I, Q146R,\nG149A, M154I, and E157Q caused minor reductions in replication compared\nto WT HIV-1 (70 to 85% of WT HIV-1), while the INSTI-resistant single\nmutants S230N and R263K caused a slightly larger drop in replication (60\nto 65% of WT HIV-1). However, the one-round replication of the\nINSTI-resistant double mutants varied considerably. The replication of\nthe double mutant M50I/R263K was approximately 70% of WT HIV-1, while\nthe INSTI-resistant double mutants S119R/R263K and Q95K/Q146R were 60%\nand 65% of WT, respectively. The rates of replication of the\nINSTI-resistant double mutants L74M/Q148R and G140S/G149A were\napproximately 40% of WT HIV-1, while the rates of replication for\nT66I/R263K and E157Q/R263K were 22% and 52% of WT, respectively. The\nG140S/G149A mutant had a lower replication rate (43%) than what we\npreviously reported for the G140S/Q148H double mutant (66%) ( 23 );\nhowever, this was not a significant difference. The replication of the\nsix INSTI-resistant triple mutants, M50I/S119R/R263K, C56S/G140S/Q148H,\nV72I/E138K/Q148K, V75A/G140S/Q148H, T122N/G140S/Q148H, and\nG140S/Q148H/G149A, and the two quadruple mutants, C56S/G140S/Q148H/G149A\nand L74M/V75A/G140S/Q148H, were all between 45 and 70% of WT HIV-1. None\nof the additional single substitutions, C56S, V75A, T122N, and G149A,\nthat were found with the G140S/Q148H double mutant significantly\nincreased or decreased the replication of the virus, nor did the\naddition of C56S and G149A or L74M/V75A to the G140S/Q148H double\nmutant. Conversely, the IN-resistant quadruple mutants\nL74I/E138K/G140S/Q148R, L74M/E138K/Q148R/R263K, and\nL74M/G140S/S147G/Q148K were deficient in single-round replication assays\ncompared to the WT, ranging from 13 to 23%. The quintuple IN-resistant\nmutant T66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/M154I had a higher single-round replication\nrate than the other three quadruple mutants (35% of WT HIV-1), but these\ndifferences were not significant. The lone sextuple IN-resistant mutant,\nT66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/Q148R/S230N, had a replication rate similar to\nthat of the complex IN mutants that contained the G140S and Q148H\nsubstitutions, 61% of WT HIV-1, which was a significant difference\ncompared to the IN-resistant quadruple mutants ( *P* \\< 0.05) but not\nthe IN-resistant quintuple mutant. These data show that there are\ncomplex IN substitutions which substantially reduce the susceptibility\nof the virus to BIC, DTG, and CAB and are still able to infect cultured\ncells reasonably well.\n\nFIG 7\n\nReplication of the INSTI-resistant mutants using a single-round\ninfection assay. The replication of the INSTI-resistant mutants used in\nthis study were measured using the vectors carrying the appropriate\nresistance substitutions in a single-round infection assay. The\nluciferase activity was set to 100, and the replication of the mutant\nvectors (adjusted for the amount of p24/Gag used in the assay) were then\nmeasured and compared to the WT. The error bars represent standard\ndeviations of independent experiments, *n* = 4, done in triplicate.\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThe development of INSTIs has led to improvements in the treatment\noptions available for HIV-1-infected individuals, and this family of\ncompounds is widely used in combination therapies. Unfortunately, the\nearly INSTIs RAL and EVG have proven to be quite susceptible to the\ndevelopment of resistance. DTG, BIC, and CAB are much less susceptible\nto the development of resistance. However, there are mutants, including\nG140S/Q148H and more complex mutants that include these two\nsubstitutions or other changes at the same positions (G140A/C/S and\nQ148H/K/R), that still present a considerable challenge to all of the\nFDA-approved INSTIs. Although further investigation is still needed,\nthere is an emerging consensus that certain substituents can be appended\nto INSTIs to improve their binding to mutant forms of IN, thereby\nbroadening the efficacy of the compounds against emerging drug-resistant\nviruses.\n\nHere, we compare the efficacies of DTG, BIC, CAB, and several of our\nmost promising INSTIs against a variety of recently described\nCAB-resistant mutants ( 22 , 24 ). As we previously reported,\nINSTI-resistant mutants with single substitutions that are located\n∼5.0 Å from the metal ions bound at the IN active site typically do not\ncause substantial decreases in susceptibility to DTG and BIC ( 23 ). The\nS230N mutant decreased susceptibility and increased FCs to both DTG\n(FC, 4.9) and compound 6b (FC, 2.4). The G149A mutant causes a minor\ndecrease in susceptibility and increase in FC (4.4) to compound 6b. In\nthe current work, many of the INSTI-resistant double mutants we tested\nwere potently inhibited by DTG, BIC, CAB, and our best INSTIs; however,\nCAB lost potency against the L74M/Q148R mutant. Nonetheless, there are\nmore complex IN mutants, defined here as mutants with at least three\nsubstitutions (and with as many as six), that pose more serious\nproblems. The IN-resistant quintuple mutant T66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/M154I\nwas the only complex IN mutant that was potently inhibited by all of the\nINSTIs (FCs, \\<2.2). One other complex IN mutant,\nL74I/E138K/G140S/Q148R, was potently inhibited by six of the INSTIs (FCs\nof \\<2.6 for the FDA-approved INSTIs and compound 4d; FCs of \\<5.6 for\nCAB and compound 6b). All of the complex IN mutants that included an\namino acid substitution at position Q148 (H or R) showed substantially\ndecreased susceptibility and increased FCs to at least some of the\nINSTIs. We previously showed that some complex IN mutants that include\nthe Q148H/K substitutions cause a significant loss of susceptibility to\nthe INSTIs described in the current report ( 16 , 23 ). There are\nseveral IN mutants with a substitution at position Q148H/K/R plus\nadditional substitutions at a position in the hydrophobic pocket (L74 or\nV75) near the active site residue D64, and the E138K and/or G140S\nsubstitutions caused a reduction in susceptibility to even the best\nINSTIs we tested ( Fig. 8 ).\n\nFIG 8\n\nAtomic model of BIC in the active site of the HIV-1 intasome. The\nstructure of the active site of an HIV intasome, with BIC bound, was\nprepared based on the published structure ( 27 ). Colors are used to\nshow the positions of the resistance substitutions (lime green)\ndiscussed in this study, the catalytic residues D64, D116, and E152\n(DDE) (light blue), viral DNA (light gray), and BIC (dark olive green).\nIN chains near the catalytic active site are labeled.\n\nWe compared the relative potencies of our promising INSTIs in assays\nusing a group of newly reported resistant mutants, which were selected\n*in vitro* . The FCs for the INSTIs against the IN mutants relative to\nWT HIV-1 were sorted according the published biological cutoffs (FCs of\n\\<2.5, FCs of 2.5 to \\<4.0, FCs of 4.0 to \\<13.0, and FCs of \\>13.0),\nand a percentage was calculated based on the 21 IN mutants tested (Table\nS7). Compound 4d potently inhibited 67% of the IN mutants we tested with\nan FC of \\<2.5 and inhibited all of the IN mutants with an FC of \\<13.0.\nWhen we compared compound 4d to our other compounds, only compound 4f\ninhibited \\>50% of the IN mutants with an FC of \\<2.5. Compounds 4c, 4f,\n6b, and 6p inhibited around one-third of the IN mutants with FCs of\n\\>13.0. Against this new panel, using an FC of \\<2.5, BIC potently\ninhibited 57% of the IN mutants. If the lower cutoff for DTG is used\n(FC, \\<4.0), BIC effectively inhibited 71% of the IN mutants. Using FCs\nof \\<4.0, both DTG and CAB inhibited 57% of the IN mutants. We\npreviously showed that, against a larger panel, DTG and BIC are more\nbroadly effective than CAB ( 16 ). Broadly speaking, CAB was effective\nagainst the IN single and double mutants but not against complex IN\nmutants. BIC had lower FCs against five of the complex IN mutants\ncompared to compound 4d (approximately the same FC was seen for BIC and\ncompound 4d against T66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/Q148R/S230N) (Table S8).\nCompound 4d had lower FCs than BIC against three of the complex IN\nmutants. Only the differences in the FCs that were lower for BIC than\nfor compound 4d were significant, and they suggested that BIC was the\noverall most effective INSTI against the current panel of mutants. DTG\nwas better than compound 4d and BIC against only one of the complex\nmutants, L74M/E138K/Q148R/R263K (FC, 5.6). The difference in potency was\nonly significant when compared against compound 4d, and not BIC,\nsuggesting that DTG was not as effective against these complex IN\nmutants. None of the compounds were fully effective against the five\ncomplex IN mutants we tested that included the G140S and Q148H\nsubstitutions. The two most promising compounds, BIC and compound 4d,\ndid not potently inhibit any of the mutants in this group (EC ~50~ ,\n\\>5.0 nM; FCs, \\>4.0). Increased FCs were observed for BIC, DTG, and\ncompound 4d against the four complex IN mutant strains,\nT122N/G140S/Q148H (FCs, 7.5, 36.7, and 7.2, respectively)\nL74M/V75A/G140S/Q148H (FCs, 11.4, 55.1, and 8.0, respectively),\nC56S/G140S/Q148H/G149A (FCs, 9.9, 28.0, and 11.9, respectively), and\nT66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/Q148R/S230N (FCs, 5.4, 32.9, and 5.4,\nrespectively).\n\nIn some cases, amino acid substitutions that allow IN (and HIV\nreplication) to evade INSTIs compromise the ability of the mutant\nviruses to replicate. The complex IN mutants V72I/E138K/Q148K\n(47.4 ± 4.3% of WT), L74M/G140S/S147G/Q148K (23.2 ± 4.5% of WT), and\nL74M/V75A/G140S/Q148H (53.4 ± 7.5% of WT), all of which caused large\ndecreases in susceptibility to all the INSTIs, also reduced replication\nin single-round infectivity assays ( Fig. 7 ; Table S6).\nL74I/E138K/G140S/Q148R and L74M/E138K/Q148R/R263K caused a substantial\nloss of replication in single-round assays to ∼15% of WT HIV-1 activity.\nHowever, the other complex IN mutants had single-round replication rates\nof ∼60% of WT HIV-1 activity. It is likely that many of these amino acid\nsubstitutions help the mutants evade the INSTIs; however, at least some\nof these substitutions may enhance the catalytic activity of the complex\nIN mutants in ways that improve the ability of the mutant virus to\nreplicate. Earlier studies, based on prototype foamy virus (PFV) IN,\nshow that there is a precedent for this type of compensatory\nsubstitution ( 11 ).\n\nThe ways in which substitutions in HIV IN affect the ability of the\nvirus to replicate and cause substantial losses in susceptibility to\nINSTIs can be investigated through a combination of structural analysis\nand modeling ( 27 , 34 ). There are now structures of INSTIs bound to\nHIV IN and to the IN of a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolated\nfrom the red-capped mangabey (SIVrcm) ( 27 , 34 ). The structures are\nquite similar, and we used the structure of BIC bound to HIV IN to\ninvestigate the ways the Q148H/K/R, G140S, E138T/A/K, and R263K amino\nacid substitutions could reduce the potency of the most recent\nFDA-approved INSTIs.\n\nThe residue Q148 occupies a strategic position in the central core,\ncontacting a key water molecule that coordinates two important catalytic\nresidues, D116 and E152 ( 24 , 27 ). The mechanism by which the Q148H\nsubstitution causes resistance has recently been described based on\nexperiments done with the intasome of a SIVrcm ( 34 ). The Q148H\nsubstitution (and by analogy, Q148R/K) displaces a water molecule that,\nin WT SIVrcm and HIV-1 IN, is engaged in coordinating the catalytic\nresidues D116 and E152 (Fig. S2). The substituted amino acid introduces\na local electropositive charge that withdraws electron density from the\nMg ^2+^ -ligand cluster. This, in turn, affects the ability of INSTIs to\nbind the catalytic core, compromising the inhibitory potency of the\nINSTI ( 34 ). When Q148H is present in combination with the compensatory\nmutant G140S, the double mutant poses substantial challenges for even\nthe most broadly effective INSTIs. Moreover, Q148 is surrounded by other\nwell-known sites of resistance (in Fig. S2, S147, G149, and I151 are\nwithin 5 Å, shown by the yellow sphere; Q146 is farther out). Amino acid\nsubstitutions at these positions enhance resistance through mechanisms\nthat are as yet undefined.\n\nSubstitutions at position E138 have become increasingly common in\ncomplex INSTI-resistant viruses. As recently suggested in the context of\nSIVrcm, the E138T substitution causes H114 to donate a proton to the\nsubstituted G140S, making S140 a hydrogen bond donor for its interaction\nwith H148, which is expected to enhance resistance ( 34 ). In our WT\nHIV-1 model (Fig. S3), there is a network of hydrogen bonds involving\nE138, H114, G140, and, by entension, the G140S/Q148H that would,\npresumably, behave similarly in HIV-1 IN and in SIVrcm IN. Substituting\nE138 for either Thr (E138T) or Lys (E138K) would facilitate propagation\nof a proton, which could potentiate the resistance associated with\nQ148H. The E138K substitution would be a stronger proton donor but may\nalso have an accessory effect, because it is close to a backbone\nphosphate in the viral DNA (Fig. S3), and the charge swap could affect\nthe interaction of the protein and the bound nucleic acid. The E138A\nsubstitution, which also arises in patients ( 6 ), is expected to have a\nmore modest effect but would still allow H114 to serve as a proton\ndonor. Further experimental work is required to determine the exact\neffects of substitutions at this position.\n\nThe substitution R263K, which is selected by the most recent\nFDA-approved INSTIs, is involved in several important interactions (Fig.\nS4 and S5). One complication in interpreting the effect of substitutions\nin IN, especially subtle changes such as R263K, derives from the\nmultimeric nature of the HIV intasome, which is composed of up to 16 IN\nsubunits. Thus, a single residue change can have different effects on\nthe different IN subunits in the complex. Here, we have used the\nnomenclature of Passos et al. ( 27 ) to identify which subunit/chain we\nare describing. R263 in chain D interacts with the backbone phosphate of\nA18 and G18 from the transferred and nontransferred strands of the viral\nDNA, respectively. G18 base-pairs with the penultimate cytosine of the\n3′ viral DNA (vDNA) end (C20), which is involved in π-stacking with the\nhalogenated benzyl moiety of INSTIs. In addition, substituting lysine\nfor arginine at position 263 of IN chain D could affect other nearby\nresidues, including Q146 of IN chain A, which hydrogen bonds to the\nhalogen atoms of the benzyl moiety of a bound INSTI. The interactions\ninvolving the 3′ end of vDNA suggest that a substitution in R263 could\ndestabilize the stacking of the halogenated benzyl moiety of the INSTI\nwith the penultimate nucleotide of the vDNA, which would reduce the\nbinding of the INSTI. R263 on IN chain C (Fig. S5), which is relatively\nclose to chains A and D IN (the distance between the two R263 residues\non chains C and D is only ∼15 Å), interacts with E246 from chain D and\nthe T17 base of the nontransferred viral DNA strand. In addition to its\neffects on the susceptibility of viral replication to INSTIs, the R263K\nmutant also reduces the replication of HIV to ∼60% in our single-round\nassay ( 35 ). There is also the possibility that this substitution could\naffect the assembly of the IN multimer. The relatively subtle nature of\nthe R263K substitution will require high-resolution structural data, and\nnew insights, to define the exact mechanism of resistance. Because R263\nplays different role(s) in the various IN subunits, it is not yet clear\nwhich of the changes is responsible for the observed decrease in\nreplication. It should be obvious that R263 is not the only amino acid\nin IN where substitutions affect the potency of INSTIs and play\ndifferent roles in distinct subunits.\n\nBased on currently available data, it appears that DTG and BIC provide a\nstrong and safe treatment strategy for treatment-naive patients ( 36 ,\n-- 41 ). However, for INSTI-experienced patients, who have undergone\nvirological failure and switched regimens to a salvage therapy, these\nnew INSTIs may not always be effective, and they may not be the best\ntherapeutic option. As the use of INSTIs increases, it is likely that\nadditional resistant viruses will emerge. It is already clear that\ncomplex mutants can be a problem and that improved INSTIs will be needed\nto overcome new complex IN mutants as they arise. This means that new\nINSTIs are needed that can effectively inhibit IN mutants, particularly\nthose that have the G140S/Q148H substitutions ( 34 ). We have been able\nto make good progress in developing INSTIs using the structures of the\nPFV intasome to develop models of how the INSTIs are bound to HIV-1 IN (\n9 , 10 , 12 , 13 , 16 ). However, having the structures of existing\nINSTIs bound to the active sites of WT HIV-1 and SIV intasomes and some\nof the more problematic drug-resistant IN mutants should give us a much\nmore detailed understanding of both drug binding and mechanisms of drug\nresistance ( 27 , 34 , 42 ). This new information should be extremely\nuseful for developing new and more broadly effective INSTIs. Compounds\nthat retain efficacy against the G140S/Q148H mutants could be used both\nto prevent new HIV-1 infections and to block the emergence of new\ndrug-resistant HIV-1 IN mutants in INSTI-experienced patients who need\nsalvage therapy.\n\n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### INSTI synthesis.\n\nDTG, BIC, and CAB were acquired as previously described ( 16 ). The\nsynthesis of compounds 4c, 4d, 4f, 6b, and 6p has been reported ( 12 ,\n13 ).\n\n### Cell-based assays.\n\nHIV-based viral vectors with either WT or mutant IN were used in\nsingle-round infectivity assays to determine the antiviral potencies (EC\n~50~ values) of the compounds as previously described ( 43 ). Briefly,\nvesicular stomatitis virus-g (VSV-g)-pseudotyped HIV was produced by\ntransfections of 293T cells with pNLNgoMIVR-ΔLUC and pHCMV-g (obtained\nfrom Jane Burns, University of California, San Diego, CA) using the\ncalcium phosphate method. Six to seven h after the calcium phosphate\nprecipitate was added, 293T cells were washed twice with\nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with fresh medium for\n48 h. The virus-containing supernatants were then harvested, clarified\nby low-speed centrifugation, filtrated, and further diluted for\npreparation in antiviral infection assays. On the day prior to the\nscreen, human osteosarcoma (HOS) cells were seeded in a 96-well\nluminescence cell culture plate at a density of 4,000 HOS cells in 100\nμl per well. On the day of the screen for antiviral activity infection\nassays, cells were treated with compounds from a concentration range of\n5 μM to 0.0001 μM using 11 serial dilutions and then incubated at 37°C\nfor 3 h. After compound incorporation, 100 μl of virus-stock diluted to\nachieve a luciferase signal between 0.2 and 1.5 relative luciferase\nunits (RLUs) was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 48 h.\nInfectivity was measured by using the Steadylite plus luminescence\nreporter gene assay system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Luciferase\nactivity was measured by adding 100 μl of Steadylite plus buffer\n(PerkinElmer) to the cells, incubating at room temperature for 20 min,\nand measuring luminescence using a microplate reader. Antiviral\nactivities were normalized to the infectivity in cells that featured the\nabsence of target compounds. KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading,\nPA) was used to perform nonlinear regression analysis on the data. EC\n~50~ values were determined from the fit model.\n\nA modified version of the single-round infectivity assay was used to\ndetermine the replication of the INSTI-resistant mutant vectors.\nBriefly, 200 ng of a WT or INSTI-resistant mutant HIV-1-based vector was\nadded to each well in 96-well plates and incubated for 48 h, and\nluciferase activity was measured as described above. The luciferase\nactivity of the WT virus was set to 100%, and the infectivity of the\nmutant viruses was measured as a percentage of that of the WT ( 23 ).\n\n### Vector constructs.\n\nThe vector pNLNgoMIVR-ΔENV.LUC has been described previously ( 13 , 16\n). To produce the new IN mutants used in this study, the IN open reading\nframe was removed from pNLNgoMIVR-ΔENV.LUC by digestion with KpnI and\nSalI, and the resulting fragment was inserted between the KpnI and SalI\nsites of pBluescript KS+. Using this construct as the wild-type\ntemplate, the following HIV-1 IN mutants were prepared using the\nQuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies,\nSanta Clara, CA): M50I/R263K, S119R/R263K, T124A/S153Y,\nM50I/S119R/R263K, L74M/Q148R, V72I/E138K/Q148K, V75A/G140S/Q148H,\nT122N/G140S/Q148H, L74M/V75A/G140S/Q148H, C65S, G149A, G140S/G149A,\nC56S/G140S/Q148H, G140S/Q148H/G149A, C56S/G140S/Q148H/G149A,\nL74M/E138K/Q148R/R263K, L74M/G140S/S147G/Q148K, L74I, Q146R, E157Q,\nQ95K/Q146R, E157Q/R263K, L74M/E138K/G140S/Q148R, M154I, S230N,\nT66I/R263K, T66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/M154I, and\nT66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/Q148R/S230N.

The IN\nmutant L74M/Q148R was made using the previously constructed IN mutant\nQ148R, with the L74M oligonucleotides being used to add the second amino\nacid substitution. The IN mutants V75A/G140S/Q148H and T122N/G140S/Q148H\nwere made with the previously constructed IN mutant G140S/Q148H ( 23 )\nand the appropriate oligonucleotides for V75A and T122N, respectively,\nto add the third amino acid substitution. The IN mutant\nL74M/V75A/G140S/Q148H was made with aforementioned IN mutant\nV75A/G140S/Q148H and the correct oligonucleotides for L74M to add the\nfourth amino acid substitution.\n\nThe IN mutants shown in Fig. 3 , which include C56S, G149A, G140S/G149A,\nC56S/G140S/Q148H, and C56S/G140S/Q148H/G149A were made as follows. The\nIN mutants C56S and G149A were constructed as described above using the\nappropriate listed oligonucleotides. The IN mutant G140S/G149A was made\nwith previously generated IN mutant G140S and the right oligonucleotides\nfor G149A to add the second substitution. The IN mutant C56S/G140S/Q148H\nwas made using the previously made IN mutant G140S/Q148H and the\nappropriate oligonucleotides for C56S to add the third amino acid\nsubstitution. The IN mutant C56S/G140S/Q148H/G149A was made using the\naforementioned IN mutant G140S/Q148H/G149A and the appropriate\noligonucleotides for C56S to add the fourth amino acid substitution.\n\nThe IN mutant shown in Fig. 4 , L74M/E138K/Q148R/R263K was made based on\npreviously existing mutants ( 16 ). The IN mutant L74M/E138K/Q148R/R263K\nwas made using the previously constructed IN mutant E138K/Q148R and the\nappropriate nucleotides for L74M and R263K, respectively, to add the\nthird and fourth amino acid substitutions.\n\nThe IN mutants shown in Fig. 5 , which include L74I, Q146R, E157Q,\nQ95K/Q146R, E157Q/R263K, and L74I/E138K/G140S/Q148R, were made as\nfollows. The IN mutants L74I, Q146R, and E157Q were constructed as\ndescribed above using the appropriate listed oligonucleotides. The IN\nmutant Q95K/Q146R was made using the previously constructed IN mutant\nQ146R and the correct Q95K oligonucleotides to add the second amino acid\nsubstitution. The IN mutant E157Q/R263K was made using the previously\nconstructed IN mutant R263K and the appropriate oligonucleotides for\nE157Q, which were used to add the second amino acid substitution. The IN\nmutant L74I/E138K/G140S/Q148R was made using the previously generated IN\nmutant E138K/Q148R and the appropriate oligonucleotides for L74I and\nG140S, respectively, to add the third and fourth amino acid\nsubstitutions.\n\nThe IN mutants shown in Fig. 6 , which include M154I, S230N, T66I/R263K,\nT66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/M154I, and T66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/Q148R/S230N, were\nmade as follows. The IN mutants M154I and S230N were constructed as\ndescribed above using the appropriate listed oligonucleotides.

The IN mutant\nT66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/M154I was made from previously generated IN mutant\nT66I ( 23 ) and the appropriate oligonucleotides for L74M and M154I,\nrespectively, to generate these amino acid substitutions, and the\noligonucleotides for E138K and S147G were used to generate these amino\nacid substitutions. The IN mutant T66I/L74M/E138K/S147G/Q148R/S230N was\nmade from previously constructed IN mutant E138K/Q148R ( 23 ) and with\nthe appropriate oligonucleotides for T66I, L74M, and S230N, and the\noligonucleotides for S147G were used to generate the third, fourth,\nfifth, and sixth amino acid substitutions, respectively.\n\nThe DNA sequence of each of the mutant constructs was verified by\nsequencing.

Moreover, CAB and BIC were minimally toxic in cell culture assays with CC ~50~ values > 250 µM.\nRationale: The paper provides extensive data on the in vitro antiviral activities of CAB and BIC against various INSTI-resistant mutants, including EC ~50~ values, which are indicative of drug susceptibility.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 27084918\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: The E157Q virus was hypersusceptible to dolutegravir, displaying an IC ~50~ of 0.43 nM, which was 100-fold lower than WT (52.1 nM). The combination of E157Q and R263K increased dolutegravir resistance by 20- and 10-fold compared with the WT and R263K enzymes, respectively. We also investigated the effects of E157Q on IN DNA binding activity and susceptibility to a DNA binding inhibitor in tissue culture, in part because we recently identified Glu157 as a putative interaction domain with the HIV IN DNA binding inhibitor FZ41\nRationale: The paper includes data on the susceptibility of various HIV-1 mutants to different integrase inhibitors, including dolutegravir and raltegravir, indicating that in vitro drug susceptibility data was reported.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 26149983\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is an investigational prodrug of the HIV-1 nucleotide reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NTRTI) tenofovir (TFV), with improved potency and drug delivery properties over the current prodrug, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). TAF is currently in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Phase 1 and 2 studies have shown that TAF was associated with increased peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) drug loading and increased suppression of HIV-1 replication compared to treatment with TDF. In this study, selection of in vitro resistance to both TAF and the parent compound, TFV, led to the emergence of HIV-1 with the K65R amino acid substitution in RT with 6.5-fold-reduced susceptibility to TAF. Although TAF is more potent than TFV in vitro, the antiviral susceptibilities to TAF and TFV of a large panel of nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant mutants were highly correlated (R2 = 0.97), indicating that the two compounds have virtually the same resistance profile when assessed as fold change from the wild type. TAF showed full antiviral activity in PBMCs against primary HIV-1 isolates with protease inhibitor, nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), or integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance but reduced activity against isolates with extensive NRTI resistance amino acid substitutions. However, the increased cell loading of TFV with TAF versus TDF observed in vivo suggests that TAF may retain activity against TDF-resistant mutant viruses.\nRationale: The paper describes the resistance selection experiments conducted with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and tenofovir (TFV).

Genotypic analysis\ncompared the acquisition and accumulation of drug resistance mutations\nat weeks 8 and 24 following drug pressure. Cell-based phenotypic assays\nassessed cross-resistance patterns to NNRTIs by acquired resistance\nmutations.\n\nResults\n\nDoravirine pressure resulted in the acquisition of V108I (6/7) and\nV106A/I/M (5/7) mutations at weeks 8, followed by F227L (4/7), Y318F\n(4/7), M230L (2/7) or L234I (2/7) by weeks 24. In contrast, rilpivirine\nresulted in E138K (5/7) followed by L100I (3/7), K101E (1/7), or M230L\n(1/7). Doravirine resistance pathways retained susceptibility to\nrilpivirine, whereas rilpivirine resistance conferred intermediate\nresistance (12--152-fold) to doravirine. Dual selections with islatravir\nor lamivudine delayed and diminished emergent resistance to doravirine,\nresulting in V108I (9/15) with fewer or no other changes at weeks 24.\nThere was a lesser delay in emergent resistance to rilpivirine when\ncombined with islatravir or lamivudine. The M184V mutation did not arise\nin dual selections with islatravir or lamivudine.\n\nConclusions\n\nDoravirine showed a more robust resistance profile compared with other\nNNRTIs. The long intracellular half-life of islatravir and delayed\nacquisition of resistance in dual selections provide an opportunity for\nlong-acting treatment options.\n\n\n\n## Materials and methods\n\nPatient-derived subtype B ( *n =* 3) and non-B clinical isolates ( *n =*\n3), as well as the HIV NL4.3 recombinant clone were subjected to *in\nvitro* cell culture selections to ascertain emergent resistance to\ndoravirine and rilpivirine. Isolates 14637, 14969, 5326 and 6343\n(GenBank accession numbers MW484894 , MW484895 , MW484893 , DQ380549 ,\nrespectively) were derived from drug-naive individuals at Clinique\nActuel obtained with ethics approval (Veritas) and informed consent. The\nsubtype C isolate, 4742 (GenBank accession number AF492618 ),\noriginating from Ethiopia was kindly provided by Shlomo Ma'ayan\n(Israel). ^17^ The 96USSN20 isolate ^18^ (GenBank MW48492 ) and pNL4.3\nrecombinant clone (GenBank AF324493 ) were obtained from the National\nInstitutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program.\n\nViral isolates were serially passaged in cord blood mononuclear cells\n(CBMCs) in the presence of escalating concentrations of doravirine and\nrilpivirine alone or paired with islatravir or lamivudine (3TC) as\ndescribed previously. ^19--21^ Briefly, stepwise drug-dose escalations\nfrom the half-maximal effective concentrations (EC ~50~ values) were\nperformed based on weekly reverse transcriptase (RT) assays that\ndetermined the extent of viral inhibition of drug-treated samples as\ncompared with matching no-drug controls for wild-type isolates. ^19^ At\neach weekly passage, an aliquot of culture supernatant was stored at\n−70°C for subsequent genotypic and phenotypic analyses.\n\nViral RNA was extracted, and genotypic analyses of all clinical isolates\nwas performed at weeks 8 and 24 of selective drug pressure to evaluate\nthe monitor the acquisition and accumulation of amino acid substitutions\n(i.e. drug resistance mutations). ^21^ A cell-based *in vitro*\nphenotypic assay monitored the impact of the progressive accumulation of\nselect mutations on drug susceptibility to doravirine, rilpivirine,\netravirine and efavirenz. ^21^ Briefly, resistant viruses were amplified\nfrom stored cell culture supernatants at designated weeks (8, 13, 17, 24\nor 30) following *in vitro* selection with doravirine or rilpivirine and\nre-genotyped. Cells infected with resistant isolates and matched\nwild-type control viruses were treated with serial dilutions of\ndesignated NNRTIs. After 7 days, culture supernatants were collected and\nanalysed for RT activity. The EC ~50~ was calculated using GraphPad\nPrism software. The fold-resistance was compared with WT viruses.\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Cell culture selections with doravirine\n\nThree subtype B, three non-B subtype clinical isolates, and the\nrecombinant clone pNL4.3 were passaged in escalating concentrations of\ndoravirine. Viruses were genotyped at weeks 8 and 24 to identify the\nfirst acquired mutation and subsequent accumulation of resistance\nmutations under sustained drug pressure (Table 1 ). At week 8,\ndoravirine selective pressure resulted in the acquisition of V108I (5/7\nisolates), V106A (one isolate) or Y318F (one isolate) (Table 1 ). Based\non paired wild-type no-drug controls, the acquisition of V108I or Y318F\nconferred low-level (under 2-fold) resistance while V106A conferred\n4-fold resistance (Table 1 ).\n\nHigh-level resistance (\\>100-fold) arose after 24 weeks of escalating\ndoravirine pressure with the accumulation of three to five mutations,\nincluding V108I ( *n =* 6/7), Y318F ( *n =* 4/7), V106A/I ( *n =* 2/7),\nH221Y ( *n =* 2/7), F227L ( *n =* 3/7), M230L ( *n =* 2/7), L234I (\n*n =* 2/7) (Table 1 ). Isolate 4742 acquired V106M, a signature subtype\nC resistance mutation. ^22^ In one isolate (14969), the E138K\nrilpivirine- and etravirine-associated mutation was observed.\n\nDual selections were performed combining doravirine with islatravir or\nlamivudine. Dual selections with doravirine and islatravir attenuated\nthe development of resistance with no resistance mutations at week 8 and\nV108I/V at week 24 (5 of 6 isolates). Overall, concentrations of\ndoravirine and islatravir could not be increased and six viruses\nremained susceptible to doravirine and islatravir (under 5-fold\nresistance) at week 24 (Table 1 ). Isolate 96USSN20 with baseline\nthymidine analogue mutations (D67N, T69D, K70R) acquired V108I, Y318F\nwith lamivudine resistance (M184I/M), conferring intermediate\nresistance.\n\nDual selections of doravirine with islatravir led to V108I alone or\npaired with secondary mutations (H221Y, Y318F) (6 of 7 isolates)\nconferring low-level resistance (2- to 5-fold) at week 24. Dual\nselections with lamivudine led to the acquisition of V106A ( *n =* 2/7)\nor V108I (3/7) and F227/F with Y318F/V ( *n =* 1/7) at week 24. It is\nnoteworthy that the potency of islatravir was in the picomolar range as\ncompared with the nanomolar range for lamivudine. ^19^ The acquisition\nof M184M/I mixtures at week 24 was observed in only one of seven\nisolates, conferring low-level resistance to islatravir and lamivudine,\nas compared with high-level resistance associated with presence of\nM184V. ^23^\n\n### Cell culture selections with rilpivirine\n\nTable 2 shows parallel cell culture selections performed with\nrilpivirine alone or in combination with islatravir or lamivudine. As\nexpected, sustained pressure with rilpivirine led to the acquisition of\nE138K at weeks 8 and 24 (2/7 and 5/7 isolates), respectively. K101E\noccurred in one isolate. The presence of E138K conferred low-level\nresistance (2- to 5-fold). It is noteworthy that the subtype C isolate\nwith E138A at baseline acquired V108I rather than E138K by week 24.\nHigh-level resistance (\\>1000-fold) to rilpivirine arose in isolate\n96USSN20 through the cumulative acquisition of E138K with V108I and\nM230L by week 24.\n\n\nIn contrast to doravirine, there was no delay in the initial appearance\nof E138K or K101E/P when rilpivirine was combined with islatravir or\nlamivudine (weeks 8--10). Of note, in isolate 14969, E138K emerged more\nrapidly under dual rilpivirine/lamivudine or rilpivirine/islatravir\npressure than with rilpivirine alone. There were, however, delays in the\naccumulation of resistance in dual selections combining rilpivirine with\nislatravir or lamivudine as compared with rilpivirine alone. Of note,\nthree selections with rilpivirine and lamivudine resulted in the\nselective acquisition of K101E/P rather than E138K at week 24. The\nappearance of M184I/V resistance mutation did not occur with rilpivirine\ncombined with lamivudine or islatravir (Table 2 ).\n\n### Cross resistance profiles for doravirine and rilpivirine\n\nIt has been reported that the resistance profiles to doravirine and\nrilpivirine are complementary and not overlapping. ^14^ Phenotypic\ncell-based assays were performed to deduce the impact of\nNNRTI-associated mutations acquired by doravirine or rilpivirine at\ndesignated weeks of serial passage in escalating drug pressure on\ncross-resistance profiles to doravirine, rilpivirine, etravirine and\nefavirenz (Table 3 ). ^14^\n\n\nThe early acquisition of V108I and V106A resulted in low-level\nreductions in susceptibility (2- to 5-fold) to doravirine (Table 1 ). In\nthree selections (5326, 4742, 96USSN20), the subsequent acquisition of\nY318F resulted in high-level resistance to doravirine and intermediate\nresistance to efavirenz, while retaining full susceptibility to\nrilpivirine and etravirine (Table 3 ). Similarly, the cumulative\nacquisition of V108I with two or more doravirine-associated mutations,\nincluding H221Y, F227L, M230L, L234I, resulted in resistance to\ndoravirine while retaining full susceptibility to rilpivirine and\netravirine (Table 3 ). In contrast, the acquisition of E138K with\nsecondary mutations in four isolates under selective rilpivirine\npressure resulted in high level (160 to \\>10 000-fold) to rilpivirine,\nas well as intermediate to high-level cross-resistance to doravirine and\nefavirenz. Of note, all tested viruses harbouring resistance to\ndoravirine were susceptible to islatravir and lamivudine (data not\nshown).\n\nVirus sequences at select passages were assessed for resistance based on\nthe Stanford HIV genotypic algorithm (\nhttps://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivseq/by-sequences/ accessed 12 January\n2021) (Table 3 ). Although the Stanford algorithm was consistent with\nresults from cell-based phenotypic assays, E138K resistance was higher\nin cell-based phenotypic assays. Overall, the accumulation of\ndoravirine-associated mutations retained susceptibility to rilpivirine.\nIn contrast, rilpivirine-associated E138K pathways exhibited\nintermediate- to high-level resistance (12- to 152-fold) to doravirine.\n\nThe complementary resistance profiles of doravirine and rilpivirine were\nconfirmed through switch experiments (data not shown). Seven strains\nharbouring V108I- or V106A/M-associated doravirine resistance acquired\nE138K/A ( *n =* 5/7), Y181C ( *n =* 1/7) or L100I ( *n =* 1/7) when\nsubjected to rilpivirine selective pressure for 16 weeks. Seven viral\nstrains harbouring E138K mutations developed V108I ( *n =* 6) or\nV106I/A/M ( *n =* 3) when subjected to doravirine selective pressure for\n16 weeks.\n\n### Prevalence of resistance to NNRTIs in drug-naive persons\n\nWe ascertained the overall prevalence of doravirine and rilpivirine\nmutations in treatment-naive subjects genotyped in Quebec genotyping\nprogramme ( *n =* 5357). Overall, the prevalence of transmitted\nresistance to doravirine was rare, with low observed frequencies of\nV108I (0.008%), V106A/M (0.04%) and Y188L/H/C (0.17%) in subtype B\ndrug-naive persons. Similarly, the prevalence of E138K/Q/G/R was low\n(0.002%) although the E138A natural polymorphism was present in 2.6% of\ndrug-naive individuals. This compares with the prevalence of K103N/S,\nY181I/C/V and G190A/S/E in 4.16%, 0.54% and 2.84% of treatment-naive\nindividuals, respectively.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this study, we applied sustained exposure to escalating\nconcentrations to identify drug resistance pathways to doravirine and\nrilpivirine. This permitted the identification of mutational pathways\nthat may arise infrequently in clinical practice under optimized\ncombination therapy. Our results revealed a favourable drug resistance\nprofile for doravirine when compared with other NNRTIs currently in use.\n\nV108I was the first mutation to arise in seven of eight strains under\ndoravirine selection pressure. This mutation is not currently listed as\na major mutation on the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance\nalgorithms. Although V108I confers low-level resistance (\\<2-fold), it\nwas the most frequent precursor to the subsequent emergence of\nresistance to doravirine in our cell culture selections.\n\nDoravirine selection of V108I or V106A was followed by two or more\ndoravirine-associated mutations (Y188H, H221Y, F227L, M230L, L234I,\nY318F) that induced high-level (\\>100- to 10 000-fold) resistance to\ndoravirine while retaining full susceptibility to rilpivirine. It is\nnoteworthy that V108I with Y318F resulted in marked resistance to\ndoravirine while remaining susceptible to rilpivirine. Y318F has been\nassociated with the use of delavirdine, conferring 42-fold decreased\nsusceptibility while displaying low-level resistance to nevirapine and\nefavirenz. ^24^ In contrast, the acquisition of high-level rilpivirine\nresistance with E138K and secondary mutations, resulted in\ncross-resistance to doravirine (20--850-fold) and other current NNRTIs.\n\nPatterns of drug resistance to doravirine were similar for the three\nsubtype B and three non-B subtype strains. It is noteworthy that the\nsubtype C strain developed the V106M mutation at week 24 that conferred\nhigh-level resistance to doravirine and efavirenz. We and others have\nshown that a signature natural polymorphism at codon 106 in subtype C\nisolates facilitates the *in vitro* and *in vivo* development of V106M\nunder selective drug pressure with NNRTIs. ^22^ ^,^ ^25^ The V106M\nmutation confers low/intermediate cross-resistance to NNRTIs and is\npresent in 21.2% of NNRTI-treatment-experienced individuals (HIV\nStanford database). ^22^ ^,^ ^25^\n\nDual selections, pairing doravirine with islatravir or lamivudine,\nattenuated the development of resistance. Viruses acquired V108I or\nV106A at week 24, retaining doravirine susceptibility (2--5-fold\nresistance). Dual selections prevented the acquisition of resistance to\nlamivudine or islatravir through the acquisition of M184V, with M184M/I\nmixtures present in only 2 of 14 selections at week 24. Furthermore,\nwhether it be with doravirine or rilpivirine, islatravir in the context\nof dual selection led to lesser resistance than lamivudine. Islatravir\nappears to be a truly robust agent that may have the best resistance\nprofile of any NRTI developed to date. The potency of islatravir is in\nthe picomolar range and the rare acquisition of M184I gives\nlow-to-intermediate fold resistance. ^19^ This compares with a nanomolar\npotency range for lamivudine.\n\nThere remains a need for improved algorithms to assess the impact of\nresistance mutations on susceptibility to the newer NNRTIs, including\ndoravirine, rilpivirine and etravirine. ^14^ ^,^ ^26^ The rare\noccurrence of doravirine-associated mutations in large genotypic\ndatabases of treatment-naive and treatment-experienced individuals in\nFrance and Spain substantiates the distinct profile for doravirine\nresistance. ^27^ ^,^ ^28^\n\nImportantly, V108I, V106A, Y188L/H/C are rarely observed in\ntreatment-naive individuals as compared with K103N/S and G190A/S/E,\nwhich are present in 4.1% and 2.8% of treatment-naive subjects in\nQuebec. Viral strains harbouring point mutations at codons 103 and 190\nretain susceptibility to doravirine and rilpivirine.\n\nTo conclude, the NNRTI drug class has been an important element for HIV\ntreatment and prevention over the past two decades. Despite the current\ntrend to use integrase inhibitors in first-line treatment, doravirine\nshows a favourable resistance profiles. In the next decade, there remain\nnew applications for NNRTI-based therapies, including two-drug\ncombinations (e.g. rilpivirine/dolutegravir and doravirine/islatravir)\nfor switch, treatment initiation, and pre-exposure prophylaxis, as well\nas long-acting (weekly to monthly) formulations and injectables.\n\n\n\n### Funding\n\nThis work was supported in part by grants from Merck investigator grant\n(58422) and Fonds de Recherche du Québec Santé-Réseau SIDA.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 37303226\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Methods:\nWT clinical isolates (n = 6) and viruses harbouring common NRTI and NNRTI RAMs (n = 6) were serially passaged in escalating concentrations of doravirine, doravirine/islatravir, doravirine/lamivudine and rilpivirine over 24 weeks. Genotypic analysis ascertained the appearance and accumulation of NNRTI RAMs. Phenotypic drug susceptibility assays assessed resistance conferred by acquired NNRTI RAMs.\nResults:\nFor WT viruses, doravirine pressure led to the appearance of V108I or V106A/I/M RAMs after 8 weeks, conferring low-level (~2-fold) resistance. After 24 weeks, the accumulation of three to six secondary RAMs, including F227L, M230L, L234I and/or Y318, resulted in high-level (>100-fold) resistance to doravirine. Notably, viruses with these doravirine RAMs remained susceptible to rilpivirine and efavirenz. This contrasted with rilpivirine where acquisition of E138K, L100I and/or K101E resulted in >50-fold cross-resistance to all NNRTIs. Doravirine selection of viruses bearing common NRTI and NNRTI RAMs showed delayed acquisition of RAMs compared with WT virus. Pairing doravirine with islatravir or lamivudine attenuated the development of NNRTI RAMs.\";\n\"Phenotypic drug susceptibility to doravirine, rilpivirine and efavirenz was monitored using a cell-based in vitro assay as previously described. Viruses were amplified from stored cell culture supernatants at designated weeks following in vitro selection. Resistant and WT control viruses were grown in CBMCs or MT-2 cells in the presence of serial dilutions of designated NNRTIs. After 7 days, culture supernatants were collected and analyzed for RT activity. The EC 50 drug concentrations were calculated using GraphPad version 6.07 software. The fold-resistance of emergent resistant variants was ascertained relative to matching WT counterparts grown in the absence of drug.\"\nRationale: The paper describes the results of phenotypic drug susceptibility assays that assess the resistance conferred by acquired NNRTI RAMs (Resistance-Associated Mutations) after serial passaging of viruses in escalating concentrations of doravirine and other drugs over 24 weeks.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 25385110\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: In vitro resistance selection of subtype B virus (MT4-green fluorescent protein [GFP] cells), as well as subtype A and C viruses (MT4-GFP/CCR5 cells) was conducted with DOR, rilpivirine (RPV), and efavirine (EFV) under low-multiplicity-of-infection conditions in a 96-well format.

EFdA resistance is not well characterized. To\nstudy EFdA resistance patterns that may emerge in naive or tenofovir\n(TFV)-, emtricitabine/lamivudine (FTC/3TC)-, or zidovudine (AZT)-treated\npatients, we performed viral passaging experiments starting with WT,\nK65R, M184V, or D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q HIV-1. Regardless of the starting\nviral sequence, all selected EFdA-resistant variants included the M184V\nreverse transcriptase (RT) mutation. Using recombinant viruses, we\nvalidated the role for M184V as the primary determinant of EFdA\nresistance; none of the observed connection subdomain (R358K and E399K)\nor RNase H domain (A502V) mutations significantly contributed to EFdA\nresistance. A novel EFdA resistance mutational pattern that included\nA114S was identified in the background of M184V. A114S/M184V exhibited\nhigher EFdA resistance (∼24-fold) than either M184V (∼8-fold) or A114S\nalone (∼2-fold). Remarkably, A114S/M184V and A114S/M184V/A502V\nresistance mutations were up to 50-fold more sensitive to tenofovir than\nwas WT HIV-1. These mutants also had significantly lower specific\ninfectivities than did WT. Biochemical experiments confirmed decreases\nin the enzymatic efficiency ( *k* ~cat~ / *K ~m~* ) of WT versus A114S\n(2.1-fold) and A114S/M184V/A502V (6.5-fold) RTs, with no effect of A502V\non enzymatic efficiency or specific infectivity. The rather modest EFdA\nresistance of M184V or A114S/M184V (8- and 24-fold), their\nhypersusceptibility to tenofovir, and strong published *in vitro* and\n*in vivo* data suggest that EFdA is an excellent therapeutic candidate\nfor naive, AZT-, FTC/3TC-, and especially tenofovir-treated patients.\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Virus breakthrough during serial passage of viruses in increasing EFdA concentrations.\n\nSerial passages were initiated by infecting MT-2 cells with WT (xxLAI),\nK65R, M184V, or D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q stock virus in the presence of\nEFdA and monitored as described in Materials and Methods. At the end of\nthe passaging, all EFdA-selected viruses, regardless the initial strain\nor number of passages, induced ≥75% syncytium formation in untreated\nMT-2 cells within 7 days of infection, indicating that they had retained\nreplication fitness.\n\nThe ability of the viruses to grow in the presence of EFdA was assessed\nby time to viral breakthrough (defined as 75% syncytium formation) at\neach passage. This time to breakthrough and the concentration of EFdA in\neach passage is shown in Fig. 1 . For WT, M184V, and\nD67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q strains, virus breakthrough typically occurred\nafter approximately 7 days. As EFdA concentrations were raised in\npassages 8 and 9, the time to virus breakthrough increased, until virus\nreplication was no longer observed in passage 10. Passage 10\ncorresponded to an EFdA concentration of 550 to 800 nM ( Fig. 1A , ​ ,C,\nC , and ​ andD D ).\n\nFIG 1\n\nSelection of resistance to EFdA by serial passage. Time to breakthrough\nwas determined (in MT-2 cells) as the number of days required for ≥75%\nsyncytium formation, at which point the supernatants were harvested,\nassayed for p24 content, and used to infect the subsequent passage. EFdA\nconcentration was doubled every second passage until P ~6~ and then\nevery passage thereafter. Results represent a single trial for each\npassage. Passages were initiated with WT (xxLAI) (A), K65R (B), M184V\n(C), and D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q (D).\n\nThe behavior of K65R deviated from the other mutants studied in two\nways. First, there was a reduction in the time to breakthrough from\npassages 1 to 4, likely because K65R ( Fig. 1B ), which confers\nhypersensitivity to EFdA ( 43 ), began to be lost as early as P ~2~ and\nwas not detected at passage 6 ( Table 1 and Fig. 1B ). The time to\nbreakthrough then increased as EFdA concentrations were raised, as\nobserved with other viruses.\n\n\n### Dose response of EFdA-passaged viruses to EFdA.\n\nTo evaluate the degree of resistance selected in the passaging\nexperiments, sensitivity to EFdA was determined for virus supernatants\nfrom passage 6 (P ~6~ ) onward. Data are presented for the viruses\nobtained from P ~6~ , P ~9~ , and, in one case, P ~10~ . P ~6~ was the\nfirst passage for which extensive sequencing analysis was performed, P\n~9~ was the effective endpoint for the WT-, M184V-, and\nD67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q-derived viruses, and P ~10~ was chosen as the\nendpoint for the K65R-derived strain. For each of the viruses, the later\npassages demonstrated increased EC ~50~ values compared to WT and\nearlier passage viruses, demonstrating that resistance had been acquired\nas expected ( Fig. 2 ).\n\nFIG 2\n\nEFdA dose response for viruses selected during serial passage in EFdA.\nP4-R5 MAGI cells were treated with various concentrations of EFdA and\ninfected with supernatants from the P ~0~ , P ~6~ , P ~9~ , or P ~10~\n(where applicable) passages of experiments using WT or mutant-HIV.\nUntreated control is P ~0~ of WT virus with no EFdA treatment. After\nincubation for 48 h, the cells were lysed, and the β-galactosidase\nactivity was assessed. (A to D) Inhibition of virus replication relative\nto infected untreated cells. Dashed line represents 50% inhibition of\nviral replication. The results represent the means ± the standard\ndeviations (SD) from one experiment with three replicates.\n\n### Development of amino acid mutations in reverse transcriptase during serial passage of viruses with EFdA.\n\nClonal sequencing confirmed the identity of the P ~0~ stock viruses.\nSimilar sequencing was carried out on clones from various passages to\nidentify any changes in RT that may have arisen during replication in\nthe presence of EFdA. Table 1 summarizes the data for P ~6~ and P ~9~\nisolates for all parental viruses, as well as viruses from P ~6~ , P ~9~\n, and P ~10~ for K65R.\n\nThe WT P ~6~ population sequencing revealed only M184I ( Table 1 ); by P\n~9~ , approximately 30% of sequences were M184I, 30% were M184I/E399K,\nand the remainder were divided between M184V and WT. Consistent with the\ninitial passage data, sequencing data showed that all clones of the K65R\nP ~6~ virus had reverted the K65R mutation back to WT. The reversion\noccurred rapidly, since K65R was not seen in the P ~2~ population. About\n90% of clones in P6 contained M184I, with the remainder containing\nM184V. Sequencing data also showed that the proportion of M184V\nincreased to approximately one-quarter of the population by P ~8~ . The\nvirus harvested following P ~9~ had a more heterogeneous population,\nwith most sequences containing M184V/A502V or M184I. By P ~10~ , the\ndiversity decreased dramatically, and A114S/M184V/A502V became the\ndominant sequence. A114S/M184V and A114S/A502V were found at a much\nlower frequency.\n\nDuring the passages that started with M184V, the connection domain\nmutation R358K appeared and became increasingly dominant as passaging\nprogressed. Passage of the D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q virus led to the rapid\nemergence of M184V (dominant in passage 6). This was joined by E399K in\nlate passages (M184V/E399K was dominant in passage 9). None of the\nstarting AZT-resistance-associated mutations were lost during passaging.\n\n### Validation of EFdA-resistance associated mutations using molecular clones.\n\nTo confirm that the identified mutations conferred EFdA resistance, we\nconstructed relevant molecular clones in a WT (NL4-3) backbone and\ncharacterized their infectivity relative to WT ( Fig. 3 ). M184V was the\nonly individual mutation that conferred ∼8-fold EFdA resistance,\nconsistent with previous reports ( 42 , 57 ). Individual mutations\nA114S, R358K, E399K, and A502V had no effect on EFdA resistance ( Fig. 3\n). The addition of A114S to M184V further increased the EFdA resistance,\nas seen in A114S/M184V (24-fold), A114S/M184V/R358K (28-fold), and\nA114S/M184V/A502V (25-fold). Hence, the highest levels of EFdA\nresistance were found in the combined presence of A114S and M184V.\n\nFIG 3\n\nResistance to EFdA of HIV-1 mutants selected during passaging. Mutations\nwere introduced into NL4-3. TZM-GFP cells were pretreated with EFdA and\ninfected after 24 h. GFP-positive cells (infected cells) were counted in\nvarious concentrations of EFdA. Mutants were normalized to WT infection\nto produce the fold change. EFdA dose-response curves were produced for\neach mutant and the EC ~50~ s calculated. Statistical significance was\ndetermined using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's posttest (\\*\\*\\*, *P \\<*\n0.0001). The results represent the means and SD for four independent\nexperiments performed in duplicate.\n\n### Susceptibility of select mutants to TDF and FTC.\n\nTo determine whether the various EFdA resistance mutations are\nsusceptible to approved drugs such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate\n(TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC), we prepared dose-response curves ( Table\n2 ). Remarkably, we found that all mutants with the EFdA resistance\nphenotype were hypersensitized to TDF. Most notably, the A114S mutation\nby itself and in the presence of M184V or A502V imparted an up to\n50-fold decrease in 50% effective dose (EC ~50~ ; i.e., an increase in\nEFdA susceptibility). As expected, all M184V mutants were significantly\nresistant to FTC (\\>100-fold), which is known resistance mutation and\ncauses therapy failure. There was a 2- to 3-fold decrease in EC ~50~ s\nfor FTC with A114S, A502V, and A114S/A502V strains.\n\n\n### Replication characteristics of molecular clone viruses.\n\nTo determine the effect of mutations on viral fitness, we tested viruses\nin single-cycle replication assays known as specific infectivity. There\nwere no statistically significant differences between the specific\ninfectivities of WT, R358K, or A502V. M184V had a reduced specific\ninfectivity compared to WT; it did not appear to be statistically\nsignificant under these experimental conditions. In addition, M184V, in\ncombination with all other mutants besides R358K, showed a significant\ndecrease in specific infectivity. However, there was a decrease in\nspecific infectivity of the A114S-containing mutants, A114S/M184V and\nA114S/M184V/A502V, compared to WT ( Fig. 4 ). To further validate this\nresult, we examined the biochemical properties of A114S RT, as described\nbelow.\n\nFIG 4\n\nSingle-round replication assays using TZM-GFP cells infected with\nindividual mutants. An ELISA was also performed on the virus to\ndetermine amount of p24 (total virus in medium). The ratio of infected\ncells per p24 was then calculated and normalized to the WT. Statistical\nsignificance was determined using a one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's\nmultiple-comparison test (\\*, *P \\<* 0.05; \\*\\*, *P \\<* 0.01). The\nresults represent the means and SD for four independent experiments\nperformed in triplicate.\n\n### Steady-state kinetics and EFdA susceptibility of mutant reverse transcriptases.\n\nTo better understand the effect of the mutations on the DNA polymerase\nactivity of RT, we performed steady-state kinetics experiments to\ndetermine the catalytic efficiency, *k* ~cat~ / *K ~m~* , for various RT\nmutants. We cloned, expressed, and purified the mutant RTs listed in\nTable 3 . We found that in the presence of the A114S mutation there was\na consistent decrease in the catalytic efficiency *k* ~cat~ / *K ~m~*\ncompared to WT RT: a 2.1-fold decrease for A114S and a 6.5-fold decrease\nfor A114S/M184V/A502V. The changes in catalytic efficiencies of these\nmutants appeared to be primarily due to the change in the *K ~m~* . The\n*K ~m~* for A502V was slightly decreased but comparable to that for the\nWT. Of note, the catalytic efficiency ( *k* ~cat~ / *K ~m~* ) for the\nA502V and M184V single mutants was comparable to that of the WT enzyme (\nTable 3 ).\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nNRTIs are the most widely used therapeutics to treat HIV infection. As\nsuch, NRTI-resistant HIV variants are becoming increasingly prevalent in\nthe HIV-1-infected population. EFdA has a strong potential for\nlong-acting first-line therapies for naive HIV-infected individuals or\nas an agent for preexposure prophylaxis, or salvage therapies. As such,\nwe were interested in identifying and characterizing EFdA resistance\nmutations that might arise during exposure of WT HIV, and especially\nNRTI-resistant virus variants, to EFdA. Moreover, there is high interest\nin discovering novel mutations or combinations of mutations that impart\nlevels of EFdA resistance that may have potential clinical implications.\n\nRegardless the genotype of the starting virus, M184I/V consistently\narose during passages through EFdA. M184V confers high-level resistance\nto both 3TC and FTC ( 14 , -- 16 , 58 ) but only low-level resistance to\nEFdA ( 34 , 41 ). Our data confirm the latter, with M184V conferring\nonly an ∼8-fold resistance to EFdA. M184V is also the primary resistance\nmutation selected during serial passage of WT HIV with the related\ncompounds EdA and Ed4T, suggesting that M184 is critical to the activity\nof 4′-ethynyl modified nucleoside analogues ( 34 , 59 ).\n\nD67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q HIV is highly resistant to AZT ( 11 , 12 ).\nSimilar to another AZT-resistant mutant, M41L/T215Y, which was\npreviously shown to display marginal resistance to EFdA ( 34 ), we found\nthat D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q demonstrated a 1.8-fold increase in EFdA\nresistance compared to WT. As we have previously shown, the excision\nunblocking mechanism of resistance is not a major challenge for EFdA;\nalthough EFdA can indeed be excised, the efficiency of reincorporation\nis so high that the net result is not significant overall excision ( 38\n). The K65R mutation confers resistance to TFV and is the mutation\nresponsible for virological failure in TFV-based therapies. K65R is also\ncross-resistant or selected during therapy with ABC, ddI, and 3TC/FTC (\n5 , 17 , 19 , -- 22 ). We previously showed that K65R is hypersensitive\nto EFdA, up to 5-fold lower EC ~50~ compared to the WT ( 34 , 41 , 43 ).\nThe present data are consistent with this finding, since K65R displayed\na longer time to breakthrough during initial passage in EFdA, and this\nbreakthrough was associated with the loss of K65R. The rapid reversion\nof this mutation not only leads to a reduction in sensitivity to EFdA\nbut also confers increased replication fitness to the virus. A114S and\nA502V were found after the reversion of K65R. Although there is no clear\nexplanation for this observation, it may reflect a stochastic aspect of\nthe drug resistance selection process. In addition, it is possible that\nthe additional passaging steps may have contributed to conditions that\nled to high concentrations of EFdA, thus increasing the selective\npressure on RT and allowing A114S to prevail.\n\nOur results highlight the challenges of selecting for EFdA resistance.\nEven when starting the passages using a variety of clinically relevant\ngenotypic backgrounds, mutations at residue 184 were consistently the\nfirst to emerge. Though in previous studies it was shown that M184V\nexhibited reduced viral fitness, we observed here a decrease in specific\ninfectivity that was not statistically significant ( 60 , -- 62 ). This\nmay be related to assay-condition-specific differences. In addition,\nEFdA was fully effective in maintaining suppression of mutant virus\nthroughout the drug treatment period in WT SIV-infected rhesus macaques\n( 47 ). EFdA-treated humanized mice infected with HIV remained fully\nsuppressed while on treatment even when M184I emerged after therapy\ncessation ( 44 ). In addition, M184V is known to fail current therapies:\n3TC and FTC (reviewed in references 63 , -- 67 ). Here, we have\nidentified a novel EFdA resistance mutation, A114S, which appeared after\n∼3 months of EFdA treatment ( Fig. 1 ). The addition of A114S to the\nM184V background (A114S/M184V, A114S/M184V/R358K, and A114S/M184V/A502V)\nenhanced EFdA resistance up to ∼28-fold, or 350% higher than M184V by\nitself. Importantly, both virological and biochemical experiments\ndemonstrated that this mutation, especially in the background of M184V,\nhas a negative impact on specific infectivity ( Fig. 4 and Table 3 ).\nSimilar results were recently presented at a conference reporting that\nA114S with M184V conferred resistance but had minimal effect on its own\n( 68 ). Specifically, it seems that the decrease in fitness is likely\ndue to decreased binding of incoming deoxynucleoside triphosphates\n(dNTPs), reflected by the increased *K ~m~* , in all cases where A114S\nmutation was present. The A114S mutation has a longer side chain, which\nmay extend closer to the 3′-OH of an incoming dNTP, thus reducing the\navailable space in the binding pocket, leading to increased selectivity\nfor the canonical dNTP. Consistent with previous data, we found that the\nA114S mutation decreased the DNA polymerase activity of RT ( 69 , 70 ).\nResidues 114 and 184 are located at opposing sides of a hydrophobic\npocket, along with Y115, F160, and the aliphatic chain of D185, which\naccommodates the 4′-ethynyl group of EFdA ( 35 , 71 ). We speculate that\nthe bulkier side chains of V184 and S114 impinge into the substrate\nenvelope of the 4′-ethynyl binding pocket, thus causing a decrease in\ndNTP binding that may contribute to the observed decrease in specific\ninfectivity. Nevertheless, A114S-containing mutants may not be a major\nproblem in patients; A114 mutations are rarely seen in clinical samples.\nAccording to the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance database, A114S mutants\nhave appeared a total of 7 times in 172,714 sequenced samples ( 72 , 73\n).\n\nIn addition, we have found that TDF inhibits the A114S/M184V\nEFdA-resistant HIV, significantly more efficiently than the WT ( Table 2\n). We have previously reported that the K65R TDF resistance mutation in\nRT also hypersensitizes HIV to EFdA ( 43 ). Thus, a combination of\ntenofovir and EFdA could be a very efficient therapy since they\ncomplement each other's resistance profile.\n\nSelected residues R358K and E399K are proximal to G359-A360 and\nK395-E396, respectively, in the RNase H primer grip region that\ninteracts with the DNA primer strand ( 74 , -- 77 ). R358K is selected\nboth in NRTI-treated patients and during passage with NRTIs in tissue\nculture ( 78 , -- 82 ). E399 is located within a cluster of several\nconserved tryptophan residues involved in RT dimerization ( 83 , 84 ).\nWe found no significant variation in EFdA resistance between M184V/E399K\nor M184V/R358K and M184V alone. Hence, neither R358K nor E399K\ncontribute directly to EFdA resistance. We initially considered that\nthese mutations might provide a fitness benefit. However, we did not\nobserve improved specific infectivity in our single-round replication\nassays. The A502V late-appearing mutation is located in the primer grip\nregion of the RNase H domain, near residues Y501 and I505 ( 75 ). Under\nthe conditions tested, we did not see changes in the biochemical fitness\nof A502V, but we did see minor decreases in *K ~m~* . M184V/A502V HIV\nsubsequently acquired the A114S mutation, which coincided with a\nsignificant increase in EFdA resistance.\n\nA major concern when introducing any new NRTI to clinical use is the\npotential for cross-resistance with current NRTIs. Our results confirm\nthat EFdA drives the selection of M184I/V, producing virus with\nhigh-level cross-resistance to 3TC and FTC. However, EFdA is a potent\ninhibitor, even against M184I/V; it retains the ability to inhibit\nreplication of these mutants at therapeutic doses ( 85 ). Conversely,\nM184I/V increases AZT sensitivity in both WT and AZT-resistant\nbackgrounds ( 10 , 16 , 86 , 87 ). Similarly, K65R confers resistance to\nTFV but is hypersensitive to EFdA ( 43 ); these data suggest that EFdA\nmay be well suited for combination therapies. We plan to study these\nmutations in primary cells, as well as various subtypes, in future\nstudies to further confirm our findings and understand EFdA inhibition\nfor implementation on a global scale.\n\nIn summary, our data demonstrate that there is a strong barrier to HIV\ndeveloping high-level EFdA resistance. The development of \\>10-fold\nresistance to EFdA required the combination of multiple mutations,\nincluding both M184V and A114S, that appear to negatively affect\nvirus-specific infectivity. These RT mutants were also found to be\ndramatically hypersensitized to tenofovir (∼0.04-fold change compared to\nWT). Hence, EFdA has the potential to become a highly effective\ntherapeutic and in combination with tenofovir.\n\n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Reagents.\n\nEFdA was synthesized by Life Chemicals (Burlington, Ontario, Canada).\nStock solutions (10 mM) of EFdA was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and\nstored in aliquots at −20°C. MT-2 cells ( 88 , -- 90 ) were cultured in\nRPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA), supplemented with 10%\nfetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, UT) and 2 mM l- glutamine, 100\nU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Mediatech, Inc.).\nP4-R5 MAGI cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM;\nMediatech, Inc.), supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM l- glutamine, 100 U/ml\npenicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 μg/ml puromycin. HEK-293 ( 91\n) and HEK-293/17 ( 92 ) cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with\n10% FBS, l- glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. TZM-GFP cells from\nMassimo Pizzato laboratory (Trento University) ( 93 , -- 95 ) were\ncultured in DMEM (Corning) supplemented with 10% Serum Plus, 2 mM l-\nglutamine (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA), and 100 U/ml\npenicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher). Jurkat LTR-GFP CCR5+ cells\n(JLTRG-R5) ( 96 , 97 ) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Cytiva Life\nSciences, Marlborough, MA) supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/ml\npenicillin/streptomycin.\n\n### Generation of virus stocks and molecular clones.\n\nInitial K65R, M184V, and D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q viruses were generated by\nsite-directed mutagenesis on an xxLAI HIV-1 backbone using the\nQuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc.,\nSanta Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols.\nSubsequently, 6 × 10 ^5^ 293-T cells were transfected with 10 μg of\nviral DNA using the PrimeFectimine mammalian transfection reagent\n(PrimGen, Oak Park, IL). After 72 h of incubation, HEK-293/T cell\nsupernatants were harvested, filtered, and used to infect 1.8 × 10 ^6^\nMT-2 cells. Infected MT-2 cells were incubated at 37°C (5% CO ~2~ ),\ninspected daily, and infectious virus was harvested at ≥50% syncytium\nformation. Emory's Cloning Core was used to make individual mutants in\nthe backbone of NL4.3. Virus stocks were made using HEK-293/17 cells\nthat were transfected with 6 μg of viral DNA using Xtreme-GENE HP\n(Roche, Basel, Switzerland) transfection reagent on a 10-cm dish of 60%\nconfluence. After 48 h of incubation, HEK-293/17 cell supernatants were\nharvested and concentrated overnight with a Lenti-X concentrator\n(Clontech, Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\n### Determination of TCID ~50~ values and p24 content.\n\nWe determined 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID ~50~ ) by\ninfecting 5 × 10 ^4^ MT-2 cells per well in 96-well flat-bottom plates\nwith 4-fold serial dilutions of virus stock. Three replicates were\nperformed for each virus. Infected plates were inspected daily for\nsyncytium formation; every 3 days, half of the supernatant was replaced\nwith fresh media. The assay was terminated when no additional syncytium\nformation was noted for 2 days. The TCID ~50~ was then calculated using\nthe Reed-Muench method ( 98 ). The p24 content of each virus stock was\ndetermined using an HIV-1 p24 ^CA^ Antigen Capture assay kit\n(SAIC-Frederick, Frederick, MA).\n\n### Serial passage for selection of resistant virus.\n\nMT-2 cells were suspended at 2.5 × 10 ^5^ cells per ml in 10 ml of\nmedium containing EFdA. Initial EFdA concentrations were chosen based on\nthe EC ~50~ of WT stock virus (8.6 nM), with a similar amount chosen for\nthe K65R virus and slightly higher concentrations for the\nD67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q (10 nM) and M184V (12 nM) strains. Passages were\ninitiated by immediately adding 200 TCID ~50~ of the appropriate\nunpassaged (P ~0~ ) virus stock to the cells, followed by gentle mixing.\nUntreated cultures were initiated by infecting 2.5 × 10 ^5^ MT-2 cells\nper ml with 200 TCID ~50~ of P ~0~ virus stock in 10 ml of drug-free\nmedium. All passages and untreated cultures were grown in T-25 tissue\nculture flasks. Every 2 to 3 days, the cells were split 1:3 with fresh\nmedia containing the appropriate concentration of EFdA. Cultures were\nvisually inspected every 1 to 2 days for the presence of syncytia. At\n≥75% syncytium formation, culture supernatants were harvested,\nconcentrated using Amicon Ultra Ultracel 100K centrifugal filters\n(Millipore, Carrigtwohill, Co. Cork, Ireland) and syringe-filtered\nthrough 0.22-μm filters (Millipore). The p24 content of the resulting\nfirst passage (P ~1~ ) supernatant was determined as described above.\nThis procedure was followed for all subsequent passages, with P ~N~\ninitiated by infecting 2.5 × 10 ^6^ MT-2 cells with P ~N-1~ virus\nsupernatant in media containing the appropriate concentration of EFdA.\nUntreated cultures were also initiated by infecting 2.5 × 10 ^6^ MT-2\ncells, in drug-free media, with P ~N-1~ virus. Since infectivity\ndifferences were expected between the P ~0~ virus and the output strains\nfrom each passage, P ~2~ and all subsequent passages were initiated by\ninfecting cells with a p24 amount of P ~N-1~ virus equivalent to the P\n~0~ virus p24 content used to initiate P ~1~ . The concentration of EFdA\nwas doubled every two passages up to P ~6~ , and then the amount of drug\nwas doubled with every passage. Passages lasting more than 60 days\nwithout syncytium formation were terminated and repeated, along with the\nprevious passage. If no syncytia were noted in a repeat passage after\n30 days, the passage was terminated, and no further attempts were\nperformed.\n\n### Sequencing of passaged viruses.\n\nViral RNA was purified from supernatants using the QIAamp Viral RNA\nminikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), the concentration was determined with a\nSpectronic BioMate\\*3 UV spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), and\n500 ng was used as the template for cDNA synthesis. First-strand PCR was\nperformed using random hexamer primers and the SuperScript III\nfirst-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The\nresulting cDNA was PCR amplified using the HIV-1 LAI-specific primers\nABR-RT-OF (1763 5′- *GGAGCCGATAGACAAGGAACTG* -3′) and ABR-RT-OR2 (3863\n5′- *GGCTACTATTTCTTTTGCTACTACAGG* -3′). These primers anneal to the 3′\nend of gag and the 5′ end of integrase, respectively, and generate a\n2,127-bp product spanning the full length of the reverse transcriptase\ngene. PCR was performed using the Expand High-Fidelity PCR System\ndNTPack (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), with 4.5 mM MgCl\n~2~ and 3.5 U of enzyme mix used for each reaction. Reactions were run\nin a PCR Sprint bench-top PCR cycler (Thermo Electron) with an initial\ndenaturation of 3 min at 94°C, followed by 30 amplification cycles, each\nconsisting of 30 s at 94°C, 45 s at 58°C, and 150 s at 72°C. After a\n7-min final extension at 72°C, the samples were used immediately or\nstored at −20°C.\n\nPCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, and\nthe 2,127-bp band was harvested using a QIAquick gel extraction kit\n(Qiagen). The concentration of DNA was determined by spectrophotometry,\nand 500 ng of sample was submitted to ACGT, Inc. (Wheeling, IL), for\nfull-length, double-stranded population sequencing. The P ~0~ consensus\nsequences from each virus were aligned in Clustal X-2 ( 99 ) with an\nindependent HIV-1 LAI nucleotide sequence (accession no. NC_001802 ) to\nensure the stock viruses did not contain unexpected mutations.\nNucleotide consensus sequences from each passage were aligned to the\nappropriate P ~0~ consensus. Chromatograms were also inspected visually\nusing Chromatogram Explorer and DNABaser (Heracle BioSoft S.R.L.,\nPitesti, Romania) for the presence of heterogeneous peaks and minority\nsequence populations not detectable in the consensus sequence.\n\n### Clonal sequencing of full-length reverse transcriptase gene PCR products.\n\nApproximately 105 ng of full-length PCR product was ligated into the\npGEM-T vector system (Promega, Madison, WI) at a 3:1 insert/vector molar\nratio and incubated overnight at 4°C. Ligations were transformed into\nMAX Efficiency DH5α competent cells (Invitrogen) by heat shock.\nBlue-white screening was used to select clones with successful\nligations, and plasmids containing the full-length reverse transcriptase\ngene were isolated with a QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen). A minimum\nof 20 clones from each sample were sequenced. Primers ABR-RT-OF and\nABR-RT-OR2 were used to sequence the 5′ and 3′ ends of reverse\ntranscriptase, while an internal portion of the gene was sequenced with\nprimer ABR-RT-IF (2211 5′- *CAGAGATGGAAAAGGAAGGG* -3′). Clones were\naligned with the appropriate P ~0~ stock virus consensus in Clustal X-2,\nand the proportion of sequences with the novel substitutions was\ndetermined.\n\n### Dose response to individual mutants.\n\nAll individual mutations were cloned into pNL4.3 using Emory's Cloning\nCore. After each virus was generated as described above, TZM-GFP cells\nwere plated at 10,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate and with serially\ndiluted EFdA, TDF, or FTC starting at 100 nM (for EFdA) or 10 μM (TDF\nand FTC). The cells and drug were incubated for 24 h. Next, the cells\nwere infected with virus and a 1-μg/ml final concentration of\nDEAE-dextran, followed by incubation for 48 h. The green fluorescent\nprotein (GFP)-positive cells were then counted using Cytation 5 (BioTek,\nWinooski, VT) with Gen5 v3.03 software.

Then, cells were infected with the various\nconcentrations of the virus and a 1-μg/ml final concentration of\nDEAE-dextran, followed by incubation for 48 h. The GFP-positive cells\nwere then counted as described above. After 48 h of incubation, the\ncells were imaged using Cytation 5 to quantify the numbers of\nGFP-positive cells, which were then split, and the medium was replaced.\nThe cells were subsequently imaged.

HIV susceptibility to DTG and RAL was determined using short-term resistance assays with TZM-bl cells, as described previously (8).\";  The addition of R262K to H51Y decreases HIV-1 susceptibility to DTG. To further characterize the R262K secondary substitution in the presence of H51Y, we performed resistance assays using TZM-bl cells and various concentrations of DTG or RAL ( Fig. 4 ), which generated EC 50 s for each virus as well as fold change (FC) values ( Table 2 ). Although the primary H51Y substitution did not confer resistance against DTG or RAL (FC values of 1.25 and 0.98, respectively), consistent with previous results ( 11 ), the addition of R262K did result in low-level but significant biochemical resistance to DTG but not to RAL (FC values of 1.9 and 0.92, respectively).\"\nRationale: The paper includes in vitro drug susceptibility data, specifically examining the susceptibility of HIV-1 to dolutegravir (DTG) and raltegravir (RAL) using short-term resistance assays with TZM-bl cells.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 25355888\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: We show that V111I does not strongly affect drug susceptibility but increases the replication capacity of the K65R and Q151M viruses. Biochemical assays demonstrate that V111I restores the polymerization defects of the K65R and Q151M viruses but negatively affects the fidelity of the HIV-2 RT enzyme. Drug susceptibility assays. Virus stocks were titrated, and equal amounts of infectious virus were used to infect TZM-bl cells in the presence or absence of RT inhibitors. Fourfold dilutions were used for all RTIs, and the range of dilutions used for each drug was a function of the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the respective compound.\nRationale: The paper mentions drug susceptibility assays and was using TZM-bl cells assay\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 37303226\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Methods:\nWT clinical isolates (n = 6) and viruses harbouring common NRTI and NNRTI RAMs (n = 6) were serially passaged in escalating concentrations of doravirine, doravirine/islatravir, doravirine/lamivudine and rilpivirine over 24 weeks. Genotypic analysis ascertained the appearance and accumulation of NNRTI RAMs. Phenotypic drug susceptibility assays assessed resistance conferred by acquired NNRTI RAMs.\nResults:\nFor WT viruses, doravirine pressure led to the appearance of V108I or V106A/I/M RAMs after 8 weeks, conferring low-level (~2-fold) resistance. After 24 weeks, the accumulation of three to six secondary RAMs, including F227L, M230L, L234I and/or Y318, resulted in high-level (>100-fold) resistance to doravirine. Notably, viruses with these doravirine RAMs remained susceptible to rilpivirine and efavirenz. This contrasted with rilpivirine where acquisition of E138K, L100I and/or K101E resulted in >50-fold cross-resistance to all NNRTIs. Doravirine selection of viruses bearing common NRTI and NNRTI RAMs showed delayed acquisition of RAMs compared with WT virus. Pairing doravirine with islatravir or lamivudine attenuated the development of NNRTI RAMs.\";\n\"Phenotypic drug susceptibility to doravirine, rilpivirine and efavirenz was monitored using a cell-based in vitro assay as previously described. Viruses were amplified from stored cell culture supernatants at designated weeks following in vitro selection. Resistant and WT control viruses were grown in CBMCs or MT-2 cells in the presence of serial dilutions of designated NNRTIs. After 7 days, culture supernatants were collected and analyzed for RT activity. The EC 50 drug concentrations were calculated using GraphPad version 6.07 software. The fold-resistance of emergent resistant variants was ascertained relative to matching WT counterparts grown in the absence of drug.\"\nRationale: The paper describes the results of phenotypic drug susceptibility assays that assess the resistance conferred by acquired NNRTI RAMs (Resistance-Associated Mutations) after serial passaging of viruses in escalating concentrations of doravirine and other drugs over 24 weeks.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 38206187\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"We measured the phenotypic susceptibility to doravirine in site-directed mutants containing V106I, V106A, V106M, or Y188L mutations in a subtype B (NL4-3) and CRF02_AG genetic background, and in a subset of recombinant viruses with clinically derived RT-RNAse H coding region harboring V106I and no other major NNRTI RAMs. The methodology has been previously described by Malet et al [11]. Briefly, RT mutants of HIV-1 were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quikchange II XL mutagenesis kit (Agilent) using specific primers introducing the expected mutations into plasmids pNL4-3, pHXB2, and pCRF02_AG. After mutagenesis, all constructs were sequenced to verify the presence of the mutations and the plasmids were prepared using the NucleoBond midi preparation kit (Macherey Nagel). Viral stocks were obtained by transfecting 293-T cells with the mutagenized HIV-1 molecular clones or the linearized pNL4-3ΔRT-RNAseH vector together with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicon including the corresponding RT-RNAseH coding region from each clinical sample, as previously described [12]. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the viral supernatants were recovered, quantified through the evaluation of the expression of β-galactosidase in TZM-bl cells, and frozen at −80°C.\n\nIn vitro susceptibility to doravirine was determined through a TZM-bl cell-based assay previously shown to correlate well with the reference phenotypic Phenosense Assay [13]. Briefly, 10 000 TZM-bl cells/well were infected with the wild-type NL4-3 strain or NNRTI-resistant viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05 in the presence of 5-fold dilutions of doravirine (MedChemExpress) ranging from 1 μM to 0.512 pM. After 48 hours, cells were treated with Glo-Lysis buffer (Promega) and the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay (Promega), then relative luminescence units were measured through the GloMax Discover instrument (Promega) and elaborated with GraphPad software to calculate 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) values.

Background\nLimited data are available regarding the susceptibility of the reverse transcriptase V106I polymorphism to doravirine.\n\n Methods\nDoravirine susceptibility was measured in site-directed mutants (SDMs) containing V106A, V106M, and Y188L mutations in subtype B (NL4-3, HXB2) and CRF02_AG background and in new recombinant viruses with RT harboring V106I from clinical isolates.\n\n Results\nThe V106I subtype B was detected in 1523 of 26 428 sequences, showing a 3.2% in B and 2.6% in non-B subtypes, and was higher in subtype F (8.1%) and D (14.3%). Fold-changes (FC) in susceptibility for SDMs were below doravirine biological cutoff (3.0) for V106I, but not for V106A, V106M, and Y188L. Clinically derived viruses tested included 22 B (median FC, 1.2; interquartile range [IQR], 0.9–1.6) and 28 non-B subtypes (median FC, 1.8; IQR, 0.9–3.0). Nine (18%) viruses showed FC values equal or higher than the doravirine biological FC cutoff.\"\nRationale: The paper  describes the methodology used to measure the phenotypic susceptibility of various HIV-1 mutants to doravirine. This includes creating site-directed mutants with specific mutations (V106I, V106A, V106M, Y188L) in different genetic backgrounds (subtype B NL4-3 and CRF02_AG), as well as using recombinant viruses from clinical samples. The susceptibility was assessed using a TZM-bl cell-based assay across a range of doravirine concentrations, and IC50 values (50% inhibition concentration) were calculated to determine the drug's effectiveness against these mutants.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 25261422\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Phenotypic drug susceptibility, Viruses resulting from the in vitro selection experiments were expanded by infecting 2 × 106 SupT1 cells in the absence of drugs.

As both\ndrugs are associated with neuropsychiatric adverse effects, this study\nassessed the mental health and HIV/ART-associated symptoms of people\nliving with HIV before and after transition to DTG.\n\n### Methods\n\nThe prospective DO-REAL cohort enrolled people starting DTG-based ART in\nLesotho from February to December 2020. For this analysis within\nDO-REAL, we included adults changing from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate\n(TDF)/lamivudine (3TC)/EFV to TDF/3TC/DTG within first-line therapy. At\ntransition and 16 weeks thereafter, participants completed the Patient\nHealth Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; depression screening), the 12-item\nShort-Form Health Survey (SF-12; mental and physical health), and a\nmodified HIV Symptom Index (mHSI; HIV/ART-related symptoms). We also\nassessed weight change. We used McNemar tests with Bonferroni\ncorrections to assess binary outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT04238767.\n\n### Results\n\nAmong 1228 participants, 1131 completed follow-up. Of these, 60.0% were\nfemale, the median age was 46 years (interquartile range \\[IQR\\]\n38--55), and the median time taking ART was 5.7 years (IQR 3.5--8.9). No\nchange was observed for weight or overall PHQ-9 or SF-12 outcomes.\nHowever, three mHSI items decreased at follow-up: 'feeling\nsad/down/depressed' (bothered 6.0% vs. 3.3% of participants at least 'a\nlittle' before vs. after transition; adjusted *p* = 0.048); 'feeling\nnervous/anxious' (7.4% vs. 3.4%; adjusted *p* = 0.0009); and\n'nightmares, strange/vivid dreams' (6.3% vs. 3.5%; adjusted *p*\n= 0.027). Individual PHQ-9 or SF-12 items also improved. Being symptom\nfree across all measures increased from 5.1% to 11.4% ( *p* \\< 0.0001).\n\n### Conclusions\n\nWe observed no negative impacts and potential moderate improvements with\nDTG, providing further support for the rollout of DTG.\n\n\n## METHODS\n\n### Study design and participants\n\nDO-REAL (Dolutegravir in Real Life in Lesotho) is a prospective,\nregistered cohort study that enrolled ART-experienced and ART-naïve\npeople living with HIV who were initiating DTG-based ART within routine\nhospital-based care in Butha-Buthe Lesotho \\[ 20 , 21 \\].\n\nIn this study within DO-REAL, we assessed the effect of transitioning\nfrom EFV- to DTG-based ART on self-reported psychological and physical\nwellbeing. We included adults enrolled at Butha-Buthe Government\nHospital who transitioned from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate\n(TDF)/lamivudine (3TC)/EFV to TDF/3TC/DTG within first-line ART from 10\nFebruary until 15 December 2020. Follow-up visits were conducted from 1\nJune 2020 to 19 May 2021, when data were closed for this analysis.\n\nShort-term virologic outcomes upon transitioning from EFV- or\nnevirapine- to DTG-based ART within the DO-REAL cohort have been\nreported separately \\[ 21 \\].\n\n### Setting\n\nLesotho has an adult HIV prevalence of 21%, of whom 82% were taking ART\nand 80% were virally suppressed in 2020 \\[ 22 \\]. In 2019, Lesotho\nnational guidelines were amended to recommend DTG as the preferred core\nagent in ART regimens for most people living with HIV \\[ 11 \\]. The\nmajor rollout of DTG took place in 2020 and was preceded by a transition\nin EFV dosing from 600 to 400 mg/day. Transitions from EFV to DTG\noccurred during routine clinic visits.\n\n### Procedures\n\nParticipants were enrolled on the day of transitioning to DTG and\nfollowed-up after approximately 16 weeks. We allowed for some\nflexibility so as not to interrupt routine operations but set a window\nof 8--32 weeks for inclusion in this analysis. At enrolment and\nfollow-up, participants were interviewed using the Patient Health\nQuestionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression screening \\[ 23 \\], a modified\nHIV symptom index (mHSI; original version \\[ 24 \\]; modified by adding\none question as detailed in the 'Measures' section below) questionnaire\non pre-specified HIV-/ART-related symptoms, the 12-Item Short-Form\nhealth survey (SF-12) general health screening tool \\[ 25 \\], and a\nshort study-specific questionnaire. The PHQ-9 \\[ 26 - 32 \\], SF-12 \\[ 2\n, 33 - 36 \\], and variations of the HIV symptom index \\[ 2 , 33 , 35 ,\n37 - 42 \\] have been used in the context of HIV in a wide variety of\npopulations in sub-Saharan Africa, including validation of the PHQ-9 \\[\n30 - 32 \\] and SF-12 \\[ 34 \\] among people living with HIV in African\nsettings. Questionnaires were translated to Sesotho, the local language.\nHeight was measured at baseline, and weight was measured at both time\npoints.\n\n### Data collection\n\nRoutine data were retrieved from medical records. Under supervision of\nthe study physician, two study data collectors administered the\nquestionnaires and entered data into the secured database of an ongoing\nopen cohort study within which DO-REAL is nested \\[ 43 \\].\n\n### Measures\n\nIn light of reports associating DTG with weight gain \\[ 44 \\], we\nassessed body mass index at both time points. Body mass index was\ncategorized as follows: very severely underweight (\\<15 kg/m ^2^ );\nseverely underweight (≥15 and \\<16 kg/m ^2^ ); underweight (≥16 and\n\\<18.5 kg/m ^2^ ); optimal (≥18.5 and \\<25 kg/m ^2^ ); overweight (≥25\nand \\<30 kg/m ^2^ ); moderately obese (≥30 and \\<35 kg/m ^2^ ); severely\nobese (≥35 and \\<40 kg/m ^2^ ); and very severely obese (≥40 kg/m ^2^ ).\n\nThe PHQ-9, used for depression screening, contains nine questions with\nthe answer options 'not at all' (scored 0), 'several days' (1), 'more\nthan half the days' (2), and 'nearly every day' (3), always referring to\nthe past 2 weeks. This leads to an overall score range of 0 to 27, with\nhigher scores indicating a greater severity of depressive symptoms \\[ 23\n\\]. In line with common practice \\[ 23 \\], we classified depression\nseverity as none/minimal (score 0--4), mild (5--9), moderate (10--14),\nmoderately severe (15--19), and severe (20--27). A tenth question on\ndifficulties associated with reported problems does not contribute to\nthe overall score, with answer options 'N/A\\' (not applicable; no\nproblems reported), 'not at all', 'somewhat difficult', 'very\ndifficult', or 'extremely difficult'.\n\nThe SF-12, used to assess general health, contains 12 items referring to\nthe past 4 weeks, with varying answer options between the items. It\ngenerates separate scores for physical and mental health: a physical\n(PCS) and mental component score (MCS), with higher values indicating\nbetter health.\n\nThe original HIV symptom index contains 20 symptoms \\[ 24 \\]; we\nincluded one additional symptom commonly associated with EFV, namely\n'nightmares, strange or vivid dreams' \\[ 12 - 14 \\]. The mHSI thus\ncontains 21 items, with the answer options 'I do not have this problem',\n'It does not bother me', 'It bothers me a little', 'It bothers me', and\n'It bothers me a lot'. The PHQ-9 and SF-12 generate overall scores, and\nthe mHSI was used to screen for individual pre-specified\nHIV-/ART-related symptoms \\[ 24 \\].\n\nLastly, we assessed the proportion of participants who were symptom free\nacross all measures, i.e., answered all PHQ-9 items with 'not at all',\nall mHSI items with either 'I do not have this problem' or 'It does not\nbother me', and all SF-12 items with the best possible answer option.\n\n### Statistical methods\n\nTo analyse PHQ-9 outcomes, we compared the categories 'none/minimal'\n(score 0--4), 'mild' (5--9), and 'moderate to severe' (10--27; wider\nrange due to the low observed prevalence of depression) between the two\ntime points. In addition to the overall score, individual items are\nreported as binary outcomes (at least 'several days' vs. 'not at all' in\nthe last 2 weeks). For the tenth question on difficulties associated\nwith the reported items, we report categorical outcomes as 'N/A', 'not\ndifficult at all', and 'at least somewhat difficult'.\n\nFor the mHSI, we report the number of pre-specified symptoms reported\noverall and reported as at least 'a little' bothersome per participant.\nWe also report the number of participants reporting at least one\npre-specified symptom or at least one pre-specified symptom classified\nas at least 'a little' bothersome. In addition, we analysed each symptom\nas a binary outcome, indicating the proportion of participants impacted\nby the symptom at least 'a little'.\n\nFor the SF-12, we report raw sum scores for the PCS and MCS as\nrecommended by Hagell et al. \\[ 45 \\], excluding item 1 ('general\nhealth'; affecting the PCS) due to a translation error. This leads to a\npossible range of 5--15 for the PCS and 6--27 for the MCS, with higher\nscores indicating better health. Individual assessments of the 12 items\ncompare the proportion selecting the best possible answer option for the\nrespective item.\n\nResults are summarized as frequencies and percentages for categorical\nvariables and as medians, interquartile ranges (IQRs), and ranges for\ncontinuous variables. Baseline characteristics are shown for\nparticipants with a follow-up visit within the window period (1131/1228\n\\[92%\\]); results at baseline and follow-up are shown and statistically\nanalysed where the respective measure was captured at both time points\n(PHQ-9: 1126/1131 \\[99.6%\\]; mHSI: 1112/1131 \\[98%\\]; SF-12: 1123/1131\n\\[99%\\]; all available: 1102/1131 \\[97%\\]).\n\nBaseline and follow-up outcomes were compared using McNemar tests or\nmarginal homogeneity tests for variables with two or more than two\ncategories, respectively. Where individual questions within one\nquestionnaire were analysed separately, the conservative Bonferroni\ncorrection was used to adjust for multiple testing within that\nquestionnaire (excluding PHQ-9 question 10, which does not contribute to\nthe PHQ-9 score).\n\nAll analyses were undertaken using Stata/MP v16.1.\n\n### Ethical considerations\n\nParticipants received study information in Sesotho and gave written\ninformed consent. Participants who were illiterate gave consent by\nthumbprint and a witness signature. DO-REAL and the cohort study in\nwhich it is nested were approved by the National Health Research Ethics\nCommittee in Lesotho (ID134-2016). DO-REAL was registered with\nClinicalTrials.gov on 23 January 2020 (NCT04238767).\n\n::: section\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Participant characteristics\n\nAmong 1228 DO-REAL participants eligible for this analysis, 1131\ncompleted follow-up within the specified window by data closure (Figure\nS1 ). Of the remaining 97 participants, one died, eight transferred to a\ndifferent facility, 14 withdrew consent, 17 were lost to follow-up, and\n57 remained in care but had no follow-up data collected within the\nwindow period. The median time between baseline and follow-up was\n16.0 weeks (IQR 14.6--17.0).\n\nBaseline characteristics are shown in Table 1 : the majority were\nfemale, the median age was 46 years (IQR 38--55), and the median time\ntaking ART was 5.7 years (IQR 3.5--8.9).\n\n\nAdherence and viral suppression data from the DO-REAL cohort have been\nreported previously \\[ 21 \\] (albeit in an analysis also including\nindividuals transitioning from nevirapine-based ART). In brief,\nadherence and viral suppression rates were high at both baseline and\nfollow-up. Among those for whom the respective data were available, the\nmedian pill count was 100% (IQR 100--100) at both baseline and\nfollow-up; \\>89% at both time points had a viral load \\<20 copies/mL,\nand \\>98% at both time points had a viral load \\<1000 copies/mL.\n\n### Body mass index\n\nThe median body mass index was 25.3 kg/m ^2^ (21.9--30.5) at baseline\nand 25.5 kg/m ^2^ (21.9--30.7) at follow-up. Overweight and obesity were\nparticularly prevalent among women: at baseline, the proportion with a\nbody mass index ≥25 kg/m ^2^ was 596/1131 (53%) overall, 478/678 (71%)\namong women, and 118/453 (26%) among men. No major changes were observed\nbetween BMI categories ( 49 ).\n\n### Depression\n\nAt both baseline and follow-up, ≥93% of participants had a PHQ-9 score\nindicating no or minimal depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score \\<5; Table 2\n). There was no change in overall PHQ-9 score category between the two\ntime points ( *p* = 0.34), though the reported impact of any problems\nassociated with depression symptoms had decreased at follow-up ( *p*\n\\< 0.0001).\n\nAssessing binary outcomes (at least 'several days' in the last 2 weeks\nvs. 'not at all') of individual items, five items showed a significant\nchange at follow-up, of which two remained significant after Bonferroni\nadjustment: 'trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much'\n(unadjusted *p* \\< 0.0001, adjusted *p* = 0.0004), and 'trouble\nconcentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching\ntelevision' (unadjusted *p* \\< 0.0001, adjusted *p* \\< 0.0001), both of\nwhich decreased after transition to DTG (Figure S2 ). The most commonly\nreported item, 'feeling down, depressed, or hopeless', was reported by\n236/1126 (21%) participants at baseline and 194/1126 (17%) at follow-up\n(unadjusted *p* = 0.0121; adjusted *p* = 0.109).\n\n### Symptoms and side effects\n\nThe median number of symptoms reported and the proportion of\nparticipants reporting symptoms were similar before and after transition\nto DTG (Table 2 ).\n\nHowever, in unadjusted testing of binary outcomes (symptom bothered\nparticipant at least 'a little' vs. 'I do not have this symptom' or 'It\ndoesn\\'t bother me'), a change was observed for five symptoms, of which\nthree remained significant after adjusting: 'feeling sad, down or\ndepressed' (unadjusted *p* = 0.0023; adjusted *p* = 0.048), 'feeling\nnervous or anxious' (unadjusted *p* \\< 0.0001; adjusted *p* = 0.0009),\nand 'nightmares, strange or vivid dreams' (unadjusted *p* = 0.0013;\nadjusted *p* = 0.027). All three had a lower prevalence at follow-up\n(Figure 1 ; stratified by sex in Figure S3 ). At both time points, the\nmost common symptom was 'muscle aches or joint pain' (11% vs. 11%;\nadjusted *p* = 1.00).\n\n### General health\n\nNeither the PCS nor the MCS raw sum scores of the SF-12 showed any\nmeaningful change between baseline and follow-up (Table 2 ).\n\nAssessment of binary outcomes (proportion selecting the healthiest\nanswer option vs. any other answer option) found that four items changed\nin unadjusted testing, of which three remained significant in adjusted\ntesting: 'how much of the time have you had a lot of energy' (unadjusted\n*p* \\< 0.0001; adjusted *p* \\< 0.0001), 'how much of the time have you\nfelt downhearted and blue' (unadjusted *p* = 0.0003; adjusted *p*\n= 0.0036), and 'how much of the time have your physical health or\nemotional problems interfered with your social activities' (unadjusted\n*p* = 0.0008; adjusted *p* = 0.0096), all of which improved after\ntransition to DTG.\n\n### Proportion of participants who are symptom free across all measures\n\nAmong participants with a full dataset for all three screening tools,\nthe proportion considered symptom free ('not at all' indicated for all\nPHQ-9 items; 'I do not have this problem' or 'It does not bother me' for\nall mHSI items; best possible answer for all SF-12 items) was 56/1102\n(5%) at baseline and 126/1102 (11%) at follow-up ( *p* \\< 0.0001).\n\n::: section\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nIn the DO-REAL prospective cohort study, we assessed mental and physical\nhealth among adults living with HIV at and 4 months after programmatic\ntransitioning from EFV- to DTG-based ART in a population with high\nadherence and viral suppression. Although we did not observe changes in\nmedian overall PHQ-9 and SF-12 scores after transitioning to DTG,\nparticipants reported improvements regarding some individual symptoms,\nnotably feeling sad/down/depressed, nervousness/anxiety, dreams/sleep,\nconcentration, and their physical and mental energy levels. Furthermore,\nthere was an increase in the proportion of participants considered\nsymptom free across all assessed measures.\n\nIn the mHSI, reporting of the symptoms 'feeling sad, down or depressed',\n'feeling nervous or anxious', and 'nightmares, strange or vivid dreams'\ndecreased. In all three cases, the number of individuals bothered at\nleast 'a little' by the respective symptom roughly halved after\ntransition to DTG. Similarly, the SF-12 item 'how much of the time (in\nthe last 4 weeks) have you felt downhearted and blue?' also decreased at\nfollow-up in binary analysis, whereas the decrease in the PHQ-9 item\n'feeling down, depressed or hopeless' was no longer significant after\nadjusting for multiple testing. No PHQ-9 or SF-12 item directly measured\nnervousness or anxiousness. Sleep was assessed by two items in the mHSI\nand one question in the PHQ-9. Although the mHSI item 'nightmares,\nstrange or vivid dreams' had decreased at follow-up, the item\n'difficulty falling or staying asleep' remained unchanged. This is\nsurprising considering the decrease in 'trouble falling or staying\nasleep, or sleeping too much' observed in the PHQ-9. The inclusion of\nsleeping too much in the PHQ-9 might partially explain the higher\nprevalence of this item in the PHQ-9.\n\nAmong randomized trials comparing DTG and EFV \\[ 2 - 7 , 33 \\], only the\nNAMSAL trial (conducted in Cameroon) comparing DTG and low-dose EFV\nprovided information on mental and self-reported physical health scores.\nSimilar to this study, NAMSAL reported no difference in the prevalence\nof at least mild depression, the overall number of symptoms, and the PCS\nor MCS assessed by the SF-12 among individuals treated with DTG versus\nlow-dose EFV \\[ 2 , 33 \\].\n\nHowever, key differences between NAMSAL and the present study limit\ncomparability: NAMSAL recruited ART-naïve people and randomized them to\nreceive DTG or low-dose EFV. Improvements of mental and physical health\nover time, observed in both study arms in NAMSAL, were likely driven by\nincreasing viral suppression. These improvements over time observed in\nNAMSAL may also partially explain the lower self-reported health in\nNAMSAL compared with the treatment-experienced, virologically suppressed\npopulation included in the present study. In NAMSAL, the SF-12 PCS and\nMCS increased over time in both arms, with the PCS reaching levels\ncomparable to those reported here, whereas the MCS remained lower in\nNAMSAL through week 48 \\[ 2 \\]. In NAMSAL, the baseline prevalence of at\nleast mild depression was over 23% at enrolment but had dropped to below\n10% in both arms by 48 weeks, with the latter result being comparable to\nthe prevalence in DO-REAL at baseline and 16-week follow-up, albeit\nusing a different screening tool \\[ 2 , 33 \\].\n\nUnlike our findings and the results within NAMSAL, an analysis of 254\nparticipants within the SEARCH010/R254 cohort reported a very slight\nincrease (with an unchanged median) in PHQ-9 scores after transition to\nDTG-based ART \\[ 46 \\]. However, in this analysis, only 82% of\nparticipants transitioned from EFV-containing ART, and the study\nincluded various ART backbones before and after transition. Furthermore,\nthis study excluded individuals with objective or subjective side\neffects on their pre-DTG (i.e., EFV-containing) ART regimen. This\nexclusion was aimed at preventing 'cognitive and psychological benefits\ngained from switching from an ART regimen with known side effects' \\[ 46\n\\]; however, the exclusion of participants with side effects taking EFV\nmay have generated a bias favouring EFV when comparing the two regimen\ncore agents. Lastly, the population in this analysis of the\nSEARCH010/R254 cohort (mostly young males; ART initiation during acute\nHIV infection; Thailand) differed greatly from the population described\nhere.\n\nThis study has several limitations. The tools and translations used were\nnot validated in this population against clinical assessments, and no\nin-depth psychiatric evaluations were performed, as the goal of this\nstudy was to assess potential shifts rather than exact prevalence.\nConsequently, we suggest that these results should not be considered as\nclinical prevalence assessments. Indeed, other studies have reported a\nhigher prevalence of depressive symptoms among people living with HIV in\nsub-Saharan Africa, albeit with major differences between individual\nstudies \\[ 47 - 49 \\]. Furthermore, the inherent limitations of a\nbefore-and-after study design apply, notably the lack of a control group\nfor temporal changes, and we cannot exclude the potential impact of\nexternal factors over time.\n\nThe strengths of this study include its large sample size, the real-life\nsetting of programmatic transition to DTG as it has been happening in\nmany low-income countries, and the relatively short follow-up period,\nwhich should minimize the impact of external factors. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first study to provide detailed data on the shift of\nindividual symptoms when changing from EFV- to DTG-based ART.\n\nFurther studies will be needed to validate the outcomes observed here,\nnotably in cohorts with lower self-reported baseline health; results\nfrom Zambia and Malawi are expected in the near future \\[ 50 \\]. Future\nstudies should also assess paediatric populations, who will mostly\ntransition from protease inhibitor- to DTG-based ART.\n\n::: section\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nWhile this study did not identify major shifts in overall mental or\nself-reported physical health after transitioning from EFV- to DTG-based\nART, the data show no negative impact of transitioning from EFV to DTG\nand suggest a potential moderate benefit of DTG with regard to specific\nneuropsychiatric symptoms. Notably, we observed improvements regarding\nfeeling sad/down/depressed, nervousness/anxiety, concentration,\ndreams/sleep, energy (though not consistent across screening tools),\nassociated difficulties or social impact, and being symptom free across\nall measures. These results further support the current recommendation\nfor the preferential use of DTG-containing first-line ART regimens.\n\n\n## FUNDING INFORMATION\n\nThis study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant\nnumber PCEFP3_181355; awarded to NDL).

However, little is known concerning the role these cells play in maintaining persistent HIV-1 during effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). To address this issue, we examined, cellular activation/exhaustion markers (Ki67, CCR5, PD-1, Lag-3 and Tim-3) and viral gag-pol DNA sequences within HLA-DR− and HLA-DR+ memory CD4+ T-cell subsets longitudinally from the peripheral blood of six participants over 3 to ≥15 years of effective therapy. HLA-DR expression was readily detected during the study period in all participants. The average expression levels of CCR5, PD-1 and Tim-3 were higher on the HLA-DR+ T-cell subset whereas the average of LAG-3 expression was higher on their HLA-DR− counterpart. The proportion of HIV-infected cells increased within the HLA-DR+ subset by an average of 18% per year of ART whereas the frequency of infected HLA-DR− T-cells slightly decreased over time (5% per year). We observed that 20--33% of HIV-DNA sequences from the early time points were genetically identical to viral sequences from the last time point within the same cell subset during ART. This indicates that a fraction of proviruses persists within HLA-DR+ and HLA-DR− T-cell subsets during prolonged ART. Our HIV-DNA sequence analyses also revealed that cells transitioned between the HLA-DR+ and HLA-DR− phenotypes. The Ki67 expression, a marker for cellular proliferation, and the combined markers of Ki67/PD-1 averaged 19-fold and 22-fold higher on the HLA-DR+ T-cell subset compared to their HLA-DR− counterpart. Moreover, cellular proliferation, as reflected by the proportion of genetically identical HIV-DNA sequences, increased within both T-cell subsets over the study period; however, this increase was greater within the HLA-DR+ T-cells. Our research revealed that cellular transition and proliferation contribute to the persistence of HIV in HLA-DR+ and HLA-DR− T-cell subsets during prolonged therapy. As such, the HIV reservoir expands during effective ART when both the HLA-DR+ and HLA-DR− cell subsets are included, and therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing the HIV-1 reservoir should target HLA-DR+ and HLA-DR− T-cells.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the persistence of HIV in memory CD4+ T-cells and the genetic analysis of HIV-DNA sequences. It does not mention any experiments or data related to in vitro drug susceptibility testing.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 36016383\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be transmitted via parenteral, sexual, or vertical exposure routes. The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals.

Eligible adults were enrolled between Jan 17 and May 11, 2019, at Ndunde and Milepa health centres, and between March 8 and May 11, 2019, at the Boma clinic. Viral load at the start of the TLD regimen was assessed retrospectively and measured at month 3, 6, and 12, and additionally at month 18 for those ever viraemic (viral load ≥50 copies per mL). Dolutegravir minimal plasma concentrations (Cmin) were determined for individuals with viraemia. Drug-resistance testing was done at the start of TLD regimen and at viral failure (viral load ≥50 copies per mL, followed by viral load ≥500 copies per mL; resistance defined as Stanford score ≥15).\nFindings: Of 1892 participants who transitioned to the TLD regimen, 101 (5·3%) were viraemic at TLD start. 89 of 101 had drug-resistance testing with 31 participants (34·8%) with Lys65Arg mutation, 48 (53·9%) with Met184Val/Ile, and 42 (40·4%) with lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumerate dual resistance. At month 12 (in the per-protocol population), 1725 (97·9% [95% CI 97·1–98·5]) of 1762 had viral loads of less than 50 copies per mL, including 83 (88·3% [80·0–94·0]) of 94 of those who were viraemic at baseline. At month 18, 35 (97·2% [85·5–99·9]) of 36 who were viraemic at TLD start with lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate resistance and 27 (81·8% [64·5–93·0]) of 33 of those viraemic at baseline without resistance had viral load suppression. 14 of 1838 with at least two viral load tests upon transitioning had viral failure (all with at least one dolutegravir Cmin value <640 ng/mL; active threshold), suggesting suboptimal adherence.

We performed the first LAI-ART demonstration project to include PWH unable to achieve or maintain viral suppression due to challenges adhering to oral ART.\n\nMethods\nWard 86 is a large HIV clinic in San Francisco that serves publicly insured and underinsured patients. We started patients on LAI-ART via a structured process of provider referral, multidisciplinary review (MD, RN, pharmacist), and monitoring for on-time injections. Inclusion criteria were willingness to receive monthly injections and a reliable contact method.\n\nResults\nBetween June 2021 and April 2022, 51 patients initiated LAI-ART, with 39 receiving at least 2 follow-up injections by database closure (median age, 46 years; 90% cisgender men, 61% non-White, 41% marginally housed, 54% currently using stimulants). Of 24 patients who initiated injections with viral suppression (median CD4 cell count, 706 cells/mm3), 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 86%–100%) maintained viral suppression. Of 15 patients who initiated injections with detectable viremia (median CD4 cell count, 99 cells/mm3; mean log10 viral load, 4.67; standard deviation, 1.16), 12 (80%; 95% CI, 55%–93%) achieved viral suppression, and the other 3 had a 2-log viral load decline by a median of 22 days.\n\nConclusions\nThis small demonstration project of LAI-ART in a diverse group of patients with high levels of substance use and marginal housing demonstrated promising early treatment outcomes, including in those with detectable viremia due to adherence challenges. More data on LAI-ART in hard-to-reach populations are needed.\n\n## METHODS\n\nStudy Setting and Population\nWard 86 is one of the oldest HIV clinics in the United States and the safety-net HIV clinic for the city and county of San Francisco. The clinic serves more than 2400 PWH aged ≥18 years (85% cisgender men, 13% cisgender women, 2% transgender women and men, 21% Black, 27% Hispanic) who have government insurance (ie, Medicaid, Medicare) or are covered through a municipal program for uninsured San Francisco residents. The clinic-wide viral suppression rate is approximately 84% [26], and prior analyses have shown that approximately 10% of patients have chronic viremia [27]. Patients without viral suppression at Ward 86 have high rates of stimulant use, mental illness, and marginal housing [15, 28, 29]. In 2019, the clinic developed a comprehensive multidisciplinary drop-in primary care model called POP-UP to better meet the needs of chronically virally nonsuppressed patients with marginal housing who struggle to engage in traditional HIV care that resulted in an increase in viral suppression from 0% to 55% for those enrolled [30].\n\nDescription of the Ward 86 Long-Acting Injectable ART Program\nWe developed a program to support patients and providers to initiate CAB/RPV-LA and to promote patient adherence to injections. Patients with or without viral suppression are allowed to enter the program. Key considerations for CAB/RPV-LA are willingness to receive 2 gluteal injections at each visit, attend regularly scheduled injection appointments, and resume oral ART if CAB/RPV-LA is interrupted, as well as provide a reliable form of communication (eg, phone, text, MyChart) and an additional method of contact (eg, friend, family member, case manager). Patients with any history of RPV-associated resistance mutations are not considered for CAB/RPV-LA [31]; however, the program allows ≤1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) mutation [23–25, 32]. The program also allows patients with hepatitis B infection to enter if they are willing to continue or initiate hepatitis B–directed treatment. Patients on medications known to decrease drug levels of CAB/RPV-LA [33] are not placed on injections.\n\nProviders at Ward 86 received education on CAB/RPV-LA, the process of referral, and feedback on outcomes of CAB/RPV-LA in the clinic at regular provider meetings. A detailed clinic protocol provides additional guidance on referral considerations. Providers refer patients to the pharmacy team for consideration of CAB/RPV-LA via a structured electronic medical record template. The clinic pharmacist reviews referrals for resistance mutations to INSTIs and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, drug–drug interactions, and hepatitis B status (to ensure maintenance/initiation of treatment for chronic hepatitis B). Patients recommended for CAB/RPV-LA are then scheduled for a pharmacist visit that includes education and counseling on the efficacy of therapy, potential side effects including local injection site reactions, and the risks of interrupting regular injections. Patients are asked to agree to take fully active oral ART in case of interruption until injections can be resumed. A pharmacy technician oversees the process of insurance authorization and procurement of medications.\n\nOur protocol favors a direct-to-inject (DTI; no oral lead-in) approach as approved by the FDA [34], regardless of viral suppression status. The DTI option removes the barrier of needing to adhere to oral ART for an additional month for those with adherence challenges as well as any obstacles related to taking oral RPV with food or without gastric acid–reducing medications. Patients without viral suppression have individualized plans for injection adherence, including identification of community-based supports, for example, case managers, home and street-based nursing services, community-based injection sites (including harm reduction sites), and receipt of small financial incentives (drawn from the Ryan White Program or city-provided funds for adherence support) for visits or blood draws. All referred and active patients are reviewed in a biweekly multidisciplinary (ie, physician, nursing, pharmacy) case conference, with additional discussion of POP-UP patients in a weekly POP-UP case conference.\n\nAfter the first injection visit, the pharmacy team conducts a follow-up telephone visit within 7 days to ensure tolerability. Injection appointment reminders and missed appointment follow-up calls/texts are performed by the pharmacy technician who is bilingual in English and Spanish. For patients who start without viral suppression, an HIV viral load is repeated every 4 weeks until it is below the lower limit of detection for our laboratory’s assay (<30 copies/mL), with resistance testing performed at the second injection visit if the viral load remains detectable. Consideration of the FDA-approved 8-week dosing interval requires demonstration of sustained viral suppression for 6 months with every 4-week dosing based on data from the antiretroviral therapy as long acting suppression (ATLAS) 2-M study [25, 35], which found that confirmed virologic failure (CVF) occurred most commonly early in the 8-week arm (7 of 8 participants with CVF failed in the first 24 weeks).\n\nIf a patient plans to miss a scheduled injection by more than 7 days, they are counseled to restart oral ART until injections are resumed; they are advised to keep 1 month of their prior oral ART regimen on hand for this purpose. In the event of an unplanned missed injection, the pharmacy technician immediately attempts to contact the patient (if not reachable, their listed contacts). If repeated attempts using different modes of contact, that is, phone, text, or letter, are unsuccessful, clinic staff pursue in-person outreach. If an injection is delayed by 10 days or more, blood work for resistance testing is obtained in addition to viral load testing. Although modeling of CAB/RPV-LA pharmacokinetics suggests that an interval of 60 days is sufficient to continue the maintenance dose (CAB 400 mg/RPV 600 mg) after a missed visit [36, 37], we favor a more conservative approach and allow a shorter interval of 42 days (28 days plus up to 14 days late), after which time the initiation dose (CAB 600 mg/RPV 900 mg) is given.\n\nData Collection and Analysis\nData were extracted from pharmacy team logs and the medical record. Providers reported housing status and stimulant use (methamphetamines, cocaine) at the time of referral. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize patients who had initiated CAB/RPV-LA by 10 February 2022 and thus were expected to have at least 2 scheduled follow-up injections by the time of database closure (15 April 2022). We present the median and range number of injections received by these patients and viral suppression outcomes, stratified by viral suppression status at the time of CAB/RPV-LA initiation. We calculated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for proportions using the modified Wilson method [38]. For patients who initiated CAB/RPV-LA without viral suppression, we display viral load measurements over time. All patients described in this analytic sample were on dosing of every 4 weeks and had at least 1 viral load measurement after initiation of CAB/RPV-LA. On-time injections were defined as injections given 28 days ± 7 days from the initial injection. Viral suppression after initiation of injections was defined as viral load <30 copies/mL on the measurement most proximal to database closure. The University of California–San Francisco Institutional Review Board approved the study.\n\n## RESULTS\n\nBetween 1 February 2021 and 15 April 2022, providers referred 132 patients, of whom 51 were started on injections. Reasons for not starting included referral in process (n = 35), on hold due to patient or provider preference (n = 24), awaiting initial injection (n = 13), ineligible due to RPV-associated resistance mutations (n = 5), subsequently declined (n = 2), and transferred care (n = 2). Of 51 patients who received injections between June 2021 and April 2022, our analytic sample with at least 2 follow-up injections consisted of 39 patients (Table 1). Median age was 46 years (interquartile range, 39–55); there were 3 cisgender women and 1 transgender woman and 24 (61%) had non-White race/ethnicity, 16 (41%) were experiencing unstable housing or homelessness, and 20 (54%) endorsed current stimulant use. Three patients were monolingual Spanish speakers. One patient had an N155H resistance mutation at baseline. Five patients were receiving other long-acting injections (antipsychotics n = 4, naltrexone n = 1).\n\nOf 24 patients who initiated CAB/RPV-LA with viral suppression (median CD4 cell count, 706 cells/mm3), 19 (79%) DTI with a median of 6 injections (range, 2–8), 100% (95% CI, 86%–100%) maintained viral suppression after starting injections. One patient successfully transferred care to another clinic, and another patient had unplanned travel to his home country and took oral therapy in the interim and was found to have viral suppression when he returned 83 days after his last injection. Of 15 patients who started with detectable viremia, (median CD4 cell count, 99 cells/mm3; mean log10 viral load, 4.67 with standard deviation 1.16), all DTI with a median of 6 injections (range 3–11,), 12 (80%; 95% CI, 55%–93%) had achieved and maintained viral suppression, including the patient with the baseline N155H mutation. For the 3 patients who had not yet achieved viral suppression, all had a 2-log decline by a median of 22 days (Figure 1). No patient decided to discontinue CAB/RPV-LA due to side effects. In general, injection site reactions were mild to moderate; 1 patient developed cellulitis at the injection site and received oral antibiotics. No cases of hepatitis B viremia were observed with discontinuation of tenofovir/emtricitabine-containing regimens, although we did not systematically measure hepatitis B DNA levels in our cohort.\n\n\nThirty-four patients (87%; 95% CI, 73%–94%) had on-time injection attendance, with 1 patient late for 1 injection and 2 patients late for 2 injections each. Two episodes of lateness required reinduction with CAB 600 mg/RPV 900 mg dosing. All of these patients were documented to have viral suppression after the delayed visits. At the time of database closure, 1 additional patient was 7 days late for his injection and had not yet presented to the clinic; this patient had viral suppression at his last injection. Two patients in our cohort who were experiencing homelessness received injections in community locations (a harm reduction mobile van and a community clinic) in collaboration with street-based nursing services.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nHere, we describe the first demonstration project to our knowledge to use CBV/RPV-LA in patients with challenges adhering to oral ART. Our data demonstrate preliminary short-term effectiveness of using every 4-week CAB/RPV-LA in patients with and without viral suppression in a diverse urban clinic that serves publicly insured patients with high levels of marginal housing and stimulant use. Consistent with clinical trial populations, those who initiated injections with viral suppression maintained suppression. A more striking finding is that those who began injections with detectable viremia successfully achieved viral suppression or had a 2-log decline in viral load within 1 month of their first injection. Two of these patients, both of whom were people with HIV for more than 10 years, had never previously been virally suppressed, including the patient with the baseline N155H mutation who has now demonstrated >8 months of viral suppression. The program allowed this patient to enroll because clinical trial participants on every 4-week dosing who developed CVF failed with RPV in addition to INSTI mutations, rather than a single INSTI mutation alone. Achieving viral suppression in those who have never been suppressed spotlights the key role LA-ART can play in benefitting those with challenges adhering to oral ART.\n\nWe note that the majority of patients in our cohort were from priority populations in EHE efforts, that is, Black, Hispanic (including monolingual Spanish-speaking PWH), and those currently using stimulants, highlighting the potential of CAB/RPV-LA to reach groups of interest. However, we had no patients aged <30 years and only a small number of women among these early adopters of CAB/RPV-LA, illuminating the need for exploration of awareness and preferences in these groups. Importantly, a small subset of patients in our program were receiving other long-acting injections, that is, antipsychotics, highlighting the promise of leveraging attendance at other injection visits to deliver CAB/RPV-LA in those with psychiatric conditions. Nearly all injections were “on-time,” and no patient had viral rebound after a late injection. In-person outreach was deployed twice for patients with unplanned missed injections. The case of the patient who went to his home country emphasizes the importance of a supply of oral ART in the event of an unplanned missed injection. No patients discontinued injections due to injection site reactions. While patients were willing to regularly attend injection appointments, some had difficulty with the recommended laboratory monitoring schedule. Small incentives, for example, $10 grocery store vouchers, are one strategy to encourage blood draws that our program has used with success.\n\nWe acknowledge several program features as facilitators of implementation. At the provider level, centralization of insurance authorization, injection initiation, and injection visit monitoring by the pharmacy team have encouraged provider referrals. At the patient level, availability of a DTI strategy removed a significant obstacle for those patients who already had demonstrated challenges to adherence. The importance of minimizing the need for adherence to oral ART prior to initiation of injections is reflected in changes made to the protocol of the ongoing AIDS Clinical Trial Group 5359 long-acting therapy to improve treatment success in daily life (LATITUDE) study in order to increase enrollment of PWH with adherence challenges, shortening the required period on oral ART from 24 to 12 weeks, and allowing a DTI option for those achieving viral suppression. In addition, allowing patients to drop in at Ward 86 on a designated injection day with flexibility on the exact time has supported retention for difficult-to-engage patients. A bilingual pharmacy technician facilitates communication with monolingual Spanish-speaking patients. Finally, partnering with community programs to deliver injections in the field has enabled the offer of injections to some of the highest-risk patients in the clinic POP-UP program, which serves PWH experiencing homelessness or marginal housing who require low-barrier care. For example, 1 POP-UP patient with detectable viremia at baseline received injections and most viral load monitoring at a mobile harm reduction van in partnership with street-based nursing staff from the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Building on these partnerships to increase access to CAB/RPV-LA is essential to reach PWH unable to achieve viral suppression on oral ART due to homelessness, substance use, or severe mental illness.\n\nAt the policy level, an important feature of the local context that has facilitated CAB/RPV-LA initiation is that all of the patients in our safety-net clinic had government-based insurance or benefits, which in California saw rapid availability of CAB/RPV-LA on formularies (May 2021 for Medicaid and October 2021 for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, or, ADAP) with relatively streamlined processes for acquiring the drugs. Prior authorization processes for commercial insurance can be more challenging [39]. Of these government-based programs, only Medicare has had copays, which for most patients were covered by ADAP. The pharmacy technician refers patients whose income is too high to qualify for ADAP to private foundations for copay coverage. CAB/RPV-LA is billed as pharmacy rather than a medical benefit, which facilitates community-based injections rather than requiring administration in a healthcare facility.\n\nLimitations of our study are that we evaluated a small cohort of patients at a single clinical site during the first year of the CAB/RPV-LA rollout. In addition, early adopters of CAB/RPV-LA may be among the most highly motivated PWH to uptake and persist with injections and as such may not be representative of those who initiate CAB/RPV-LA at later points in time. Our findings may not be transferable to rural areas or jurisdictions with different insurance formulary requirements. Nevertheless, we believe our experience provides important knowledge about the use of CAB/RPV-LA outside of clinical trial settings.\n\nIn summary, in this small demonstration project, we found that patients with detectable viremia due to challenges adhering to oral ART can be successfully started on CAB/RPV-LA. Our data show early success in suppressing this group of patients on CAB/RPV-LA and in keeping patients with viral suppression suppressed. A longer period of follow-up and a larger cohort, along with other demonstration projects to examine the use of CAB/RPV-LA in hard-to-reach populations and qualitative assessments of acceptability, are needed.\n\n## Notes\nFinancial support.

Outcomes are reported.\n\n### Methods\n\nEligibility criteria included need for parenteral therapy, no primary\nresistance mutations to cabotegravir or rilpivirine, and established\nretention in care. Demographic, efficacy, and safety data were obtained\nfrom standardized programme applications and quarterly clinical updates.\nIndividuals received a loading dose of LA cabotegravir 600 mg +\nrilpivirine 900 mg, followed by LA maintenance doses of 400 mg/600 mg\nevery 4 weeks; some received lead-in oral cabotegravir and rilpivirine.\n\n### Results\n\nThrough July 2020, 35 people living with HIV-1 had data available. The\nmost frequent reason for compassionate use request was chronic\nnon-adherence due to psychological conditions (n = 15). Of 35 people\nliving with HIV-1, 28 had detectable viremia (median viral load 60 300\ncopies/mL) and seven were virologically suppressed at programme entry;\n16/28 and 6/7 achieved or maintained virological suppression at data\ncutoff, respectively. Seven people living with HIV-1 discontinued for\nincomplete virological response, six with detectable viremia at\ninitiation; six and four had new reverse transcriptase and integrase\nmutations at discontinuation, respectively. Six non-fatal serious\nadverse events were reported, two considered possibly treatment related.\nFour deaths were reported; none were treatment related. One individual\nreported two pregnancies and continued LA dosing.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nMost people living with HIV-1 had advanced disease and achieved (16/28)\nor maintained (6/7) virological suppression with LA therapy.\nCabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA as compassionate use provided a\nvaluable treatment option for individuals with adherence issues with\noral therapy and advanced disease.\n\n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Compassionate use programme design\n\nPhysicians could request compassionate use access to the two-drug,\nintramuscularly administered ART regimen consisting of cabotegravir\nLA + rilpivirine LA for people living with HIV-1 through single-patient\nrequest programmes supported by ViiV Healthcare (for cabotegravir) and\nJanssen (for rilpivirine). Each request was individually reviewed and\napproved on a case-by-case basis by separate committees of senior\nphysicians convened at both companies. Individuals who did not satisfy\nall entry criteria but had a compelling reason for compassionate use\nwere also considered for inclusion in the programme and included people\nliving with HIV-1 whose baseline CD4+ cell count was \\>200 cells/mm ^3^\n(entry criteria for enrollment included a CD4+ cell count of \\<200\ncells/mm ^3^ ). Such exemptions to entry criteria requirements were only\npermitted on an infrequent basis when the benefit/risk ratio was\nfavourable. Compassionate use programmes were conducted in accordance\nwith local regulatory guidelines for the UK, the USA, Belgium, Canada,\nNetherlands, Switzerland, Portugal, Italy, South Korea, and Spain, each\nof which had participating people living with HIV-1. Individuals\nprovided written informed consent when required by local regulations.\n\n### Eligibility criteria\n\nEligible people living with HIV-1 were men and women aged ≥18 years with\nHIV-1 infection and no available or limited ART alternatives, a need for\nparenteral administration, and no major integrase or reverse\ntranscriptase mutations associated with resistance to cabotegravir or\nrilpivirine, respectively. Virologists from each company were consulted\nto provide expert evaluation regarding a specific mutation and its\nimpact on the efficacy of either cabotegravir or rilpivirine. A K103N\nmutation was not exclusionary. Requests were accepted and reviewed for\npeople living with HIV-1 who were unable to be effectively treated\nthrough oral administration due to dysphagia, malabsorption, or\ngastrointestinal conditions. Consideration was also given to people\nliving with HIV with prolonged non-adherence to oral ART and concomitant\nprogressive HIV-1 disease. All people living with HIV-1 were required to\nhave an established relationship with their healthcare provider,\ndemonstrating good retention in care, which was determined by the\nevaluating committee to represent an acceptable surrogate for adherence\nto Q4W injection visits.\n\nIndividuals who were eligible to participate in any phase III clinical\ntrial of cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA were not eligible. Individuals\nwith bleeding disorders, a significant history of seizures, or\ncatastrophic gastrointestinal illness post-abdominal surgery were also\nnot considered for the programme. Individuals with alanine\naminotransferase (ALT) levels \\>5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN), ALT\nlevels ≥3 × ULN plus bilirubin levels ≥1.5 × ULN, evidence of\nmoderate-to-severe hepatic impairment, grade 3 or 4 liver fibrosis, or\ncirrhosis were not eligible for this programme. Individuals with known\nor suspected allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to integrase\ninhibitors or significant coagulopathy precluding chronic intramuscular\ndosing were also not eligible. Women of childbearing potential who were\npregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant or breastfeed\nduring treatment were ineligible, and women of reproductive potential\nwere advised to use pregnancy prevention methods, including abstinence\nor use of highly reliable contraceptives, starting 2 weeks before\ncabotegravir and rilpivirine administration until at least 52 weeks\nafter discontinuation. If a woman became pregnant while receiving\ncompassionate use therapy, the case was reviewed by the same committees\nat ViiV Healthcare and Janssen that originally provided approval to\ndetermine whether to allow continued dosing during pregnancy or to\nremove the individual from the programme. Concomitant use of medications\nthat could significantly decrease cabotegravir or rilpivirine levels\nwere not permitted, including carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine,\nphenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin/rifampin, rifapentine,\nsystemic dexamethasone (except for a single-dose treatment), and St\nJohn\\'s Wort. Use of systemic anticoagulation on the day of an\nintramuscular injection was to be avoided to reduce the risk of local\nbleeding.\n\n### Compassionate use treatment\n\nFor the majority of people living with HIV-1 (66%) reported herein,\ntreatment was initiated with an oral lead-in of cabotegravir\n30 mg + rilpivirine 25 mg once daily for 4 weeks to assess initial\ntolerability. Exemptions were granted for participants for whom an oral\nlead-in was not possible, such as those with malabsorption issues,\ndifficulties with swallowing, or chronic non-adherence to oral regimens\ndue to psychological conditions and associated advanced disease. All\npeople living with HIV-1 received a loading dose of intramuscular\ncabotegravir 600 mg LA + rilpivirine 900 mg LA administered as separate\ninjections of 3 mL each. Subsequent maintenance doses of intramuscular\ncabotegravir 400 mg LA + rilpivirine 600 mg LA were administered Q4W as\nseparate injections of 2 mL each.\n\n### Assessments\n\nDemographic data were obtained from standardized compassionate use\napplications. Data for plasma viral load, CD4+ cell count, ART\nresistance profile, number of injections, and safety and tolerability,\nincluding injection site reactions (ISRs), were obtained from quarterly\nclinical updates as reported by the treating physician. Extracted\nde-identified data were compiled by the lead compassionate use\nphysician. Treating physicians were accountable for monitoring and\ncollecting safety information, including timely reporting of\npregnancies, adverse events (AEs), and serious AEs (SAEs), or events\nleading to treatment discontinuation to ViiV Healthcare/GlaxoSmithKline\nand Janssen Pharmaceutica.\n\n::: section\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Demographic characteristics\n\nEfficacy and safety data were available for 35 people living with HIV-1\nwho received cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA through the compassionate\nuse programme from February 2016 through July 2020. Included individuals\nwere from ten countries, including 12 from the UK; 11 from the USA; two\neach from Belgium, Canada, Netherlands, and Switzerland; and one each\nfrom Portugal, Italy, South Korea, and Spain. Of the people living with\nHIV-1 included, 57% were female, 31% were perinatally infected, and\nmedian age was 36 years (Table 1 ). The majority of people living with\nHIV-1 requested compassionate use because of chronic poor adherence to\noral ART due to psychological conditions (43%) or physical challenges\n(23%). Most (66%) people living with HIV-1 received an oral lead-in of\ncabotegravir + rilpivirine for \\~4 weeks before starting LA dosing; the\nremaining 34% initiated LA injections without an oral lead-in.\n\n\n### Efficacy\n\nAt data cutoff, 22 (63%) of 35 people living with HIV-1 achieved (16/28)\nor maintained (6/7) virological suppression (HIV-1 RNA \\<50 copies/mL)\non cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA (Figure 1 ). The median duration of\nfollow-up for all individuals was 10 months (range 1--47). Of the 13\npeople living with HIV-1 not virologically suppressed at data cutoff,\ntwo (15%) had not yet received LA injections and one (8%) had initiated\nthe programme \\<4 months before the data cutoff.\n\nOf the 35 people living with HIV-1 included in this analysis, 28 (80%)\nentered the compassionate use programme with detectable viremia (HIV-1\nRNA ≥50 copies/mL; median 60 300 copies/mL \\[range 86 to\n\\>10 000 000\\]), 11 of whom had HIV-1 RNA \\>100 000 copies/mL (Figure 1\n; Table 1 ). At data cutoff, virological suppression was achieved in 16\n(57%) of 28 people living with HIV-1 on cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine\nLA, four without an oral lead-in period. Median time to virological\nsuppression as reflected in the quarterly clinical updates was 5 months\n(range 1--31), with 4 of 16 people living with HIV-1 experiencing\nvirological suppression in ≤2 months, 11 in ≤6 months, and 13 in\n≤12 months. Of the 28 people living with HIV-1 with detectable viremia\nat initiation, 22 (79%) had an initial CD4+ cell count \\<200 cells/mm\n^3^ (median 61.5 \\[range 3--691\\]); CD4+ cell count increased in each of\nthese individuals with available data at cutoff (median change from\nbaseline +126.5 cells/mm ^3^ \\[range +5 to +498\\]; n = 20). Of the seven\npeople living with HIV-1 who were virologically suppressed at initiation\nof oral cabotegravir + rilpivirine, six (86%) maintained virological\nsuppression with cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA at their last\nfollow-up visit; the seventh stopped LA therapy after experiencing an\nHIV-1 RNA blip (55 copies/mL) after the 19th injection and subsequently\nachieved suppression on a different regimen (Table 2 ). A total of 11\n(31%) perinatally infected people living with HIV-1 were included in the\nprogramme, eight (73%) of whom experienced virological suppression with\ncabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA.\n\n\nSeven (20%) people living with HIV-1, six of whom were women, stopped LA\ntherapy because of incomplete virological response (\\>50 copies/mL),\nwith HIV-1 RNA at discontinuation ranging from 55 to 186 972 copies/mL\n(Table 2 ). Of these, six had detectable viremia at programme entry, two\nof whom achieved HIV-1 RNA \\<50 copies/mL before virological failure,\none without an oral lead-in period; the other four did not achieve\nvirological suppression after receiving 2 to 11 LA injections during the\nprogramme. At the time of discontinuation, each of the six participants\nwith detectable viremia at programme entry had NNRTI\nresistance-associated mutations not observed at programme initiation\nthat conferred resistance to rilpivirine; at programme entry, two of\nthese participants had the NNRTI resistance-associated mutation E138G,\nwhich confers resistance to rilpivirine \\[ 14 \\]. Three people with\ndetectable viremia at programme entry had mutations in integrase at time\nof discontinuation that were not observed at programme initiation, two\nof whom had mutations in integrase that conferred resistance to\ncabotegravir, including in one individual who did not achieve\nvirological suppression during dosing \\[ 14 \\]. At time of virological\nfailure, the individual with virological suppression at initiation had a\nmutation in integrase that conferred resistance to cabotegravir and no\nNNRTI resistance-associated mutations \\[ 14 \\]; this individual\noral cobicistat-boosted darunavir + tenofovir\nalafenamide/emtricitabine + dolutegravir; neither individual was\nvirologically suppressed at the time of analysis. The other four people\nliving with HIV started an oral regimen after stopping cabotegravir\nLA + rilpivirine LA, one of whom eventually achieved virological\nsuppression after starting oral cobicistat-boosted darunavir/tenofovir\nalafenamide/emtricitabine, two were not virologically suppressed at time\nof analysis, and one did not have data available since time of\ndiscontinuation.\n\n### Safety\n\nDetailed safety assessments were not available for all participants.\nWhere available, the most frequently reported AE was ISRs; pain (34%;\nn = 12) and nodule formation (9%; n = 3) were the most common. Of ten\npeople living with HIV-1 with initial injection site pain, four (40%)\nreported an absence of ISRs after the first few injections; the\nremaining six reported ISRs with continued injections, including pain\n(n = 4) and probable hematoma (n = 1). No participant discontinued\ncabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA because of ISRs. During LA therapy,\nfour people living with HIV-1 reported four non-fatal SAEs that were\nunrelated to treatment (incarcerated hernia, cryptococcal\nmeningitis/immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, right inguinal\nabscess, and right nasal vestibulitis), all of whom continued\ncabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA (Table 3 ). One additional individual\nreported two SAEs involving loss of consciousness and abnormal behaviour\nthat were considered possibly related to treatment; this person\ndiscontinued cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA after the SAE of abnormal\nbehaviour was identified. Four deaths occurred through the data cutoff,\nnone of which were related to compassionate use treatment. Deaths were\ndue to pulmonary failure in an individual with immune reconstitution\ninflammatory syndrome--associated Kaposi\\'s sarcoma of the lung,\nurosepsis and renal failure in an individual with urethral obstruction,\nsuicide in an individual with a past medical history of four suicide\nattempts, and progressive HIV-1 infection/AIDS in one individual. One\nwoman reported two pregnancies while receiving cabotegravir\nLA + rilpivirine LA and continued LA dosing. The first pregnancy\nresulted in a late miscarriage at 23 weeks +1 day. With the second\npregnancy, she delivered a healthy live male infant by caesarean section\nfor maternal pre-eclampsia at 37 weeks of gestation. See Appendix S1 for\nthe document describing the complete case narrative for this\non-treatment pregnancy.\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nCompassionate use of cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA was provided to\npeople living with HIV-1 with severe adherence challenges to oral ART\nfor psychological reasons or issues related to malabsorption or other\ngastrointestinal problems. Most (63%) achieved or maintained virological\nsuppression with intramuscular cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA Q4W.\nVirological suppression was achieved with cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine\nLA in 16 (57%) of 28 people living with HIV-1 who entered the\ncompassionate use programme, 13 of whom had taken three or more prior\nART regimens. In addition, six (86%) of seven people living with HIV-1\nwho were virologically suppressed at programme initiation maintained\nvirological suppression with cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA.\nCabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA was also efficacious in a cohort of\nperinatally infected people living with HIV-1, 73% of whom achieved or\nmaintained virological suppression. As these individuals have lived with\nHIV-1 for \\>2 decades and used two to ten prior ART regimens, the\nsuccess of LA therapy in this perinatally infected cohort is noteworthy.\nCabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA was generally well tolerated, with no\ndiscontinuations due to ISRs. Of the six non-fatal SAEs reported in five\nparticipants, one individual had two SAEs that were considered possibly\nrelated to LA therapy. Thus, cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA provides\nan alternative treatment option for people living with HIV-1 in need of\nparenteral ART, including those with adherence challenges with oral\ntherapy related to psychological conditions (see Appendix S2 for a\ngraphical representation of the programme design and outcomes).\n\nSeven people living with HIV-1 discontinued cabotegravir\nLA + rilpivirine LA therapy because of incomplete virological response\n(Table 2 ). Of these, three had a body mass index \\>30 kg/m ^2^ , which\nmay have contributed to incomplete virological response by potentially\ninterfering with the ability to reach the target muscle during\ninjection. Individuals approved for the programme may have had\nincomplete ART histories and unknown pre-existing resistance-associated\nmutations, which may also have affected virological response to LA\ntherapy. Six people living with HIV-1 had NNRTI resistance-associated\nmutations at discontinuation that were not observed at programme\ninitiation, two of whom also had INSTI resistance-associated mutations\n\\[ 14 \\]. One individual with NNRTI resistance-associated mutations at\ndiscontinuation also had mutations in integrase that did not confer\nresistance to cabotegravir. One individual had an INSTI\nresistance-associated mutation without NNRTI resistance-associated\nmutations. Of the six people living with HIV-1 with incomplete\nvirological response who had available viral load data after\ndiscontinuation of LA therapy, two achieved virological suppression\nafter switching to an alternative oral regimen. Although the rate of\nvirological failure at week 48 among participants receiving cabotegravir\nLA + rilpivirine LA in the phase III ATLAS, FLAIR, and ATLAS-2M trials\nwas low (16/1636; 1%), 14 of 16 participants had INSTI or NNRTI\nresistance-associated mutations that conferred resistance to either\ncabotegravir or rilpivirine \\[ 1 - 3 \\]. Therefore, it is important to\nclosely monitor people living with HIV-1 receiving cabotegravir\nLA + rilpivirine LA to facilitate early detection of virological failure\nand avoid resistance-associated mutations, especially in\ndifficult-to-treat populations for whom pre-existing\nresistance-associated mutations may not be known, such as those included\nin this compassionate use programme.\n\nEntry into the compassionate use programme was restricted to people\nliving with HIV-1 who were ineligible for clinical trials, resulting in\ninclusion of people with significantly more advanced disease and/or\nadherence challenges with oral therapy compared with clinical trial\nparticipants. At treatment initiation, many people living with HIV-1 had\ndetectable viremia, AIDS-defining opportunistic illnesses, or prior use\nof multiple ART regimens, all of which increase the risk of mortality \\[\n15 \\]. By contrast, in the phase III ATLAS and FLAIR trials,\nparticipants with active AIDS-defining opportunistic illnesses were\nexcluded, and study participants must have achieved virological\nsuppression before initiating treatment \\[ 1 , 2 , 15 \\]. Nevertheless,\n63% of people living with HIV-1 receiving compassionate use therapy with\nmore advanced clinical disease achieved or maintained virological\nsuccess with LA therapy, reinforcing its potential efficacy, even for\nthis difficult-to-treat population. No new safety concerns were\nidentified in this small sample of severely ill or adherence-challenged\npeople living with HIV-1, with ISRs being the most commonly reported AE\n\\[ 1 , 2 \\].\n\nOne woman became pregnant and opted to continue taking cabotegravir\nLA + rilpivirine LA. At data cutoff for this report in July 2020, data\nfrom pregnant women receiving cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA were\nlimited to 13 study participants who had 15 pregnancies in phase II/III\nLA clinical trials, all of whom discontinued LA therapy after pregnancy\nconfirmation; five of these pregnancies occurred during the\npharmacokinetic tail after discontinuation of LA therapy \\[ 1 - 3 , 16\n\\].\n\nCompassionate use programmes facilitate early access to drugs in\nlate-stage clinical development for patients who do not qualify for\nongoing registrational studies and have serious or life-threatening\nconditions with prohibited or limited treatment options \\[ 12 , 13 \\].\nCompassionate use programmes may also allow access to investigational\ndrugs for patients in countries awaiting regulatory approval of a drug\nthat has already been approved elsewhere \\[ 17 \\]. Unlike many other\nconditions with compassionate use programmes, multiple antiretroviral\nagents are already approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.\nMoreover, this compassionate use programme is unique in that it not only\nfacilitated early access to the emerging novel treatment paradigm of\ncabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA, the first LA injectable therapy for\nHIV-1, but it also fulfilled a specific need among people living with\nHIV-1 who are in need of parenteral ART administration.\n\nThere are limitations to this report: there was no comparator treatment,\nthe population was small, and no major statistical analyses were\nperformed. Because this investigation was not a clinical trial per se,\nit lacks the strict criteria regarding data collection, including\ncomplete adherence data, and the AE/SAE reporting mandated in clinical\ntrials. While this programme did require reporting of all drug-related\nAEs and SAEs and pregnancies, it was not managed by ViiV Healthcare or\nJanssen in the manner of a clinical trial, so reporting of safety data\nwas solely at the discretion of the treating physician. Compassionate\nuse programmes are not designed to obtain efficacy or safety data on\ninvestigational drugs; therefore, overall interpretation of these\nresults is limited \\[ 12 , 13 \\].\n\nMost people living with HIV-1 who received compassionate use access to\nintramuscular cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA Q4W achieved or\nmaintained virological suppression, and LA therapy appeared to be\ngenerally well tolerated in this population. Many individuals in this\nprogramme had prior severe adherence challenges with oral therapy for a\nvariety of psychological and physical reasons, and many also had\ndetectable viremia and advanced disease at LA therapy initiation.\nAlthough previous ART history was examined as closely as possible,\npre-existing mutations may have been present but unknown to the\nevaluating committees. A favourable risk/benefit ratio was ultimately\nused to decide case approval among this group of people living with\nHIV-1 who were severely immunocompromised and at risk of death. Despite\nthe serious challenges that come with treating a population with these\ncharacteristics, virological suppression was achieved or maintained with\ncabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA in 63% of these individuals. Access to\nLA ART may also be attractive to individuals with adherence challenges\nwith oral therapy. Therefore, in the context of compassionate use,\ncabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA provided a valuable treatment option\nfor people living with HIV-1 who had limited treatment options and\nissues preventing enteral administration of ART.\n\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis report was funded by ViiV Healthcare.

Three participants who received long-acting therapy had confirmed virologic failure (CVF) at Week 48, and all had HIV-1 that was originally classified as subtype A1 and contained the baseline integrase polymorphism L74I; updated classification algorithms reclassified all 3 as HIV-1 subtype A6. Retrospectively, the impact of L74I on in vitro sensitivity and durability of response to cabotegravir in HIV-1 subtype B and A6 backgrounds was studied. Site-directed L74I and mutations observed in participants with CVF were generated in HIV-1 subtype B and a consensus integrase derived from 3 subtype A6 CVF baseline sequences. Rilpivirine susceptibility was assessed in HIV-1 subtype B and A1 containing reverse transcriptase mutations observed in participants with CVF. HIV-1 subtype B L74I and L74I/G140R mutants and HIV-1 subtype A6 I74L and I74/G140R mutants remained susceptible to cabotegravir; L74I/Q148R double mutants exhibited reduced susceptibility in HIV-1 subtypes B and A6 (half maximal effective capacity fold change, 4.4 and 4.1, respectively). Reduced rilpivirine susceptibility was observed across HIV-1 subtypes B and A1 with resistance-associated mutations K101E or E138K (half maximal effective capacity fold change, 2.21 to 3.09). In cabotegravir breakthrough experiments, time to breakthrough was similar between L74 and I74 viruses across HIV-1 subtypes B and A6; Q148R was selected at low cabotegravir concentrations. Therefore, the L74I integrase polymorphism did not differentially impact in vitro sensitivity to cabotegravir across HIV-1 subtype B and A6 integrase genes (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02938520).\nRationale: They describe detailed experiments measuring the effectiveness of the antiretroviral drugs cabotegravir and rilpivirine against various HIV-1 strains and mutations.\nAnswer: Yes"}

The degree of interest was not quantified,\nbut answers were classified as \"interested,\" \"uncertain,\" \"little or not\ninterested.\"\n\nMultinomial logistic regression was performed to evaluate predictors of\ninterest or uncertainty, versus little or no interest, in LA regimen.\nVariables associated with interest or uncertainty with *p* ≤ 0.05 in the\nunivariate analysis were used as covariates in the multivariate\nanalysis. The odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence\nintervals (CI) were calculated to estimate the interest in the LA\nregimen.\n\nA total of 486 individuals eligible for LA cabotegravir and rilpivirine\nwere interviewed. The main baseline characteristics of the studied\npopulation are listed in Table 1 .\n\n\nThree hundred twenty-five (67%) expressed their interest to switch to\nthe LA regimen, 91 (19%) were uncertain, 70 (14%) were little or not\ninterested in the proposal.\n\nAt univariate analysis, variables associated with interest in the LA\nregimen with *p* ≤ 0.05 were: age, years since HIV diagnosis, years with\nHIV-RNA \\<50 copies/ml, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, white blood cells count,\nneutrophil cells count, and type of ART.\n\nThe number of concomitant medications for comorbidities was not\nassociated with the propensity to switch to LA cabotegravir and\nrilpivirine.\n\nThe results of multivariate analysis are summarized in the Table 2 : a\nregimen based on NNRTIs compared to InSTIs (aOR = 0.479, 95%\nCI = 0.261−0.880, *p* = 0.018), a regimen based on protease inhibitors\ncompared to InSTIs (aOR = 0.258, 95% CI = 0.098−0.680, *p* = 0.006), and\nthe CD4+/CD8+ ratio (aOR = 0.876 for 0.2-unit increment, 95%\nCI = 0.791−0.971, *p* = 0.012) were inversely associated with interest\nin the switch to LA cabotegravir and rilpivirine.\n\nThe main finding of this study is that most of the interviewed people\nwere interested in switching to LA cabotegravir and rilpivirine. This\nresult is consistent with recent findings.\n\nCARISEL is a Phase 3b, multicenter, open-label,\nimplementation-effectiveness study that examined the acceptability,\nappropriateness, and feasibility of LA cabotegravir and rilpivirine\ninjections in 18 HIV centers in Europe. Overall, 91% ( *n* = 372/408) of\nstudy participants felt \"very\" or \"extremely positive\" about this\nregimen at month 4 (i.e., while already receiving injections), compared\nwith 84% ( *n* = 350/419) at Month 1 (i.e., at the end of the oral\nlead-in period). Overall, 99% of study participants felt \"somewhat\" to\n\"extremely\" positive about implementing LA cabotegravir and rilpivirine.\n^2\\ ,\\ 3^\n\nIt must be underlined that the individuals enrolled in the CARISEL study\nhad already experienced the LA regimen (or at least oral cabotegravir\nand rilpivirine), while people interviewed in our investigation did not.\n\nNadir Onlus (a leading Italian Patient Advocacy Group in the field of\nHIV/AIDS) conducted a web survey on PLWH investigating through\nquestionnaire preferences regarding LA injections. Four hundred and ten\n(84%) of the participants said that LA regimen would be convenient, and\n336 (69%) declared that the greatest benefit would be not having to\nremember to take pills. ^4^\n\nThis survey may resemble our study for population characteristics, but\nit should be considered that the population answering a web-based\nquestionnaire may be a selected one, compared to unselected people\ncoming to an outpatient clinic for a routine visit and discussing this\noption with his/her referring physician for the first time.\n\nAnother peculiarity of our study is that there were many individuals\nwith a long history of exposure to ART (median 12.5 years), while in\nmost other studies that have evaluated LA in people receiving their\nfirst-line regimen. ^5\\ ,\\ 6^\n\nA limitation of our study is the possibility of unmeasured confounders\n(e.g., distance between home and the center, agophobia); we also did not\ncollect, during the interview, the motivation for the propensity to\nswitch to the LA regimen.\n\nIn summary, although two third of people stated to be interested in\nbeing treated with a LA regimen of cabotegravir and rilpivirine every 8\nweeks, the propensity of the interest varies among people according to\nsome characteristics, specifically, type of the current ART regimen and\nCD4+/CD8+ ratio.\n\n\n\n## FUNDING INFORMATION\n\nViiV Healthcare\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 34978890\nQuestion ID: 13\nQuestion: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\nEvidence: \"The phase III FLAIR study evaluated the efficacy of monthly cabotegravir LA 1 rilpivirine LA in maintaining virologic suppression in adults with HIV-1 infection (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02938520).\"\nRationale: The paper mentions that the participants were part of the FLAIR study, which is a clinical trial.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 34978890\nQuestion ID: 16\nQuestion: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: \"The FLAIR study demonstrated noninferiority of monthly long-acting cabotegravir 1 rilpivirine versus daily oral dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine for maintaining virologic suppression.

This study describes the DRM prevalence\nin HIV-infected paediatric patients in Panama.\n\n### Methods\n\nDuring 2018--19, plasma was collected from 76 HIV-infected\nchildren/adolescents (5 ART-naive, 71 treated) in Panama for HIV-1 DRM\n*pol* analysis, predicted antiretroviral (ARV) susceptibility by\nStanford, and HIV-1 variant phylogenetic characterization.\n\n### Results\n\nHIV-1 *pol* sequences were recovered from 67 (88.2%) of 76\nchildren/adolescents (median age 12 years), carrying 65 subtype B, 1\nsubtype G and 1 unique recombinant URF_A1B. Five were ART-naive and 62\nART-treated under virological failure (viraemia \\>50 copies/mL) with\nprevious exposure to NRTIs, (100%), NNRTIs (45.2%), PIs (95.2%) and\nintegrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs, 17.7%). Among the treated\npatients, 34 (54.8%) carried resistant strains, with major DRMs to one\n(40.3%), two (9.7%) or three (4.8%) ARV families. Most of them harboured\nDRMs to NRTIs (58.5%) or NNRTIs (39%), but also major DRMs to PIs (4.9%)\nand INSTIs (6.5%). We also found dual-class NRTI + NNRTI (12.2%) and\nNNRTI + PI (2.6%) resistance. Two naive subjects carried viruses with\nDRMs to NRTIs and NRTI + NNRTI, respectively. Sequenced viruses\npresented high/intermediate resistance mainly to\nemtricitabine/lamivudine (48.9% each) and efavirenz/nevirapine (33.3%\neach). Most participants were susceptible to PIs (91.3%) and INSTIs\n(88.1%).\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThe high DRM prevalence to NRTIs and NNRTIs observed among treated\nHIV-infected children/adolescents in Panama justifies the need for\nroutine resistance monitoring for optimal rescue therapy selection in\nthis vulnerable population.\n\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Ethics\n\nThis research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of\nHelsinki and was approved by local Ethics Committees for Clinical\nInvestigation from Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal (Madrid, Spain)\n(ID-117/19) and from Hospital del Niño Doctor José Renán Esquivel\n(Panamá) (ID-CBIHN-M-201909-003). Informed consent was required for all\nparents or legal tutors for inclusion in the cohort.\n\n### Sample collection\n\nAround 275 paediatric patients are living with HIV in Panama. Paediatric\npatients are mainly followed up in two hospitals in the country, with a\nhigh rate (5%) of perinatal infections. The 58% HIV-infected paediatric\npopulation is followed up at the Hospital del Niño Doctor José Renán\nEsquivel, attending to 160 patients (2 months to 18 years old), with 50%\nbetween 15 and 18 years old. Most (95%) were infected perinatally and\nall are under ART, 43% of them reaching HIV viral suppression. Plasma\nsamples from 76 HIV-positive naive or ART-treated children and\nadolescents with therapeutic failure under clinical follow-up at this\nhospital were collected during 2018--19. The samples were kept at −20°C\nuntil transported on dry ice to the HIV-1 Molecular Epidemiology\nLaboratory in Madrid, Spain, where they were stored at −80°C until\nprocessing.\n\n### Resistance analysis\n\nHIV-1 RNA was extracted from plasma by automated magnetic silica\nextraction using the EasyMAG extractor (bioMérieux). The extracted RNA\nwas amplified by RT--PCR and nested PCR to obtain the HIV-1 *pol*\nregion, using primers designed by WHO for protease (PR) and reverse\ntranscriptase (RT) amplification and ANRS primers for integrase (IN)\namplification, ^25\\ ,\\ 26^ as previously described. ^27\\ ,\\ 28^ PCR\namplicons were purified with illustra ^TM^ ExoProStar ^TM^ (Cytiva) and\nsequenced by Macrogen Inc. Lasergene software was used to assemble and\nmanually edit the sequences. Viral sequences included the complete HIV-1\nPR (codons 1--99), partial RT (1--345) and IN (48--285) for genotyping\nstudy of DRMs to PIs, NRTIs, NNRTIs and integrase strand transfer\ninhibitors (INSTIs). Stanford HIVdb Program v9.0 (Stanford University,\nPalo Alto, CA, USA) ( https://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-sequences/ )\nwas used to characterize DRMs in pre-treated children/adolescents and\npredict the resistance level to 25 ARVs in *pol* genotypes. Transmitted\ndrug resistance (TDR) mutation prevalence was established among the\nART-naive population by the WHO TDR list 2009 implemented in the\nCalibrated Population Resistance (CPR) tool v8.0 (\nhttps://hivdb.stanford.edu/cpr/ ) and by the Stanford algorithm v9.0,\nboth available on the Stanford HIV website ( https://hivdb.stanford.edu/\n). ^7^\n\n### HIV-1 variant characterization\n\nPR, RT and IN nucleotide sequences were aligned using the ClustalW\nalgorithm implemented in MEGA6 to characterize HIV-1 variants.\nPhylogenetic trees were reconstructed as previously described, ^29^\nconsidering a branch support of \\>70%. For HIV-1 variant classification,\nwe used reference sequences from each HIV-1 group M subtype, sub-subtype\nand circulating recombinant form (CRF). ^30^ Sequences not clustering\nwith any known subtype or CRF were analysed using the Recombination\nDetection Program (RDP3v4.13), ^31^ identifying the subtypes involved in\neventual recombination events and hypothetical recombination\nbreakpoints. To further confirm the detected putative recombination\nevents, new phylogenetic analyses were performed using the sequence\nfragments assigned to different subtypes according to the proposed\nbreakpoint position(s) defined by RPD3. In the positive cases, the\nrecombinant sequences were redefined as unique recombinant forms (URFs).\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nMedians were assessed for data not normally distributed. The statistical\nsignificance was calculated using Fisher's exact test or chi-squared\ntest for categorical variables and Mann--Whitney test for continuous\nvariables. Two-sided *P* values of \\<0.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism\nv8.0.1. The percentage of viruses carrying DRMs was calculated with 95%\nCIs.\n\n### Accession numbers\n\nHIV-1 sequences were submitted to GenBank with the following accession\nnumbers: OM201778 -- OM201846 .\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Study cohort\n\nPlasma samples were collected from 76 HIV-infected children/adolescents\nunder clinical monitoring at the Hospital del Niño Doctor José Renán\nEsquivel in Panama, five of them drug-naive and 71 ART-experienced at\nsampling, exhibiting \\>50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL of plasma. Table ​ Table1 1\nsummarizes the epidemiological and virological features of the 76\nHIV-1-infected children/adolescents that made up the complete study\ncohort at sampling (2018--19). The median age at diagnosis and first ART\nwas 1 year (14 days to 13 years), while it was 12 years (7 months to 18\nyears) at sampling. Nearly all (97.3%) the children with available\ninformation acquired HIV infection by mother-to-child transmission; only\ntwo subjects were infected by sexual transmission. Around half (65.2%)\nof the 69 with available data did not receive prophylaxis. Out of the 24\n(34.8%) subjects with previous prophylaxis, 75% had received zidovudine,\n20.8% zidovudine + lamivudine and one patient efavirenz + lamivudine.\nAmong the 74 (97.4%) children/adolescents with known CD4 data, 10\n(13.5%) presented \\<200 cells/mm ^3^ at sampling, revealing a delay in\nHIV diagnosis. Most (70.2%) of the 57 subjects with documented data\nlacked comorbidities.\n\nThree naive subjects started the first ART at sampling.\n\nThe two naive children had received zidovudine and lamivudine as\nprophylaxis before sampling.\n\nAt sampling, all 71 treated children/adolescents had received NRTIs,\n45.1% NNRTIs, 95.8% PIs and just 11 (15.5%) patients were\nINSTI-experienced (Table ​ (Table1). 1 ). The 71 treated subjects were\nunder their first (33.8%), second (29.6%) or third (16.9%) ART regimen,\nand 14 (19.7%) had received four to eight different ART regimens at\nsampling, having failed at least three previous ART regimens. Most\ntreated children (98.6%) had received lamivudine + zidovudine, followed\nby lopinavir / ritonavir (95.8%) and efavirenz (45.1%). About half\n(64.3%) of the 70 treated children with available data had received ART\nimmediately after HIV diagnosis. However, four (5.7%) suffered a long\ndelay in treatment, ranging from 7 months to 7 years from the first\ndiagnosis and the start of ART. Three of the five naive children started\nART immediately upon HIV diagnosis, right when the analysed sample was\ncollected. However, the remaining two started ART 5 months and 3 years,\nrespectively, after HIV diagnosis.\n\n### HIV-1 DRM analysis\n\nHIV-1 *pol* sequences (46PR/45RT/67IN) were recovered from 67 (88.2%) of\n76 children/adolescents (median age 12 years), five of them ART-naive\nand 62 treated at sampling (Table ​ (Table1). 1 ). Two (40%) of the five\nnaive children had received prophylaxis with zidovudine + lamivudine,\none for 27 days and the other for 1 month. Figure ​ Figure1 1 and Table\nS1 (available as Supplementary data at *JAC* Online) indicate the\npercentage of patients carrying DRMs to the main ARV families in\nART-naive, treated and the total paediatric population studied with\navailable *pol* sequence. Table ​ Table1 1 shows the PR, RT and IN\nsequences recovered in naive (5PR/4RT/5IN) and treated (41PR/41RT/62IN)\nsubjects. We were able to amplify 6 (54.5%) of the 11 samples with\nVL ≤ 1000 copies/mL and 61 (93.8%) of the 65 samples with \\>1000\ncopies/mL (Table ​ (Table1 1 ).\n\nFigure 1.\n\nPercentage of HIV-infected paediatric patients carrying DRMs to the main\nARV families in Panama (2018--19). Mean prevalence (coloured figures)\nand 95% CIs in the 67 children/adolescents under study with available\n*pol* sequence: 46PR, 45RT and 67IN. 'Single' is resistance to one ARV\nfamily, 'double' to two ARV families, 'triple' to three ARV families.\n'Total' covers resistance by ARV family. 'No DRMs' means no major DRMs\nfound in the available sequenced *pol* regions per patient. DRMs to PIs\nand INSTIs are always major unless indicated otherwise. More data are\navailable in Table S1 . This figure appears in colour in the online\nversion of *JAC* and in black and white in the print version of *JAC* .\n\nAmong the 67 subjects with sequence, 36 (53.7%) were infected with\nviruses carrying major DRMs to one (38.8%), two (10.4%) or three (4.5%)\nARV families, while the remaining 46.3% did not show any major DRMs in\nthe sequenced regions. When minor DRMs to INSTIs and PIs were also\nconsidered, 37 (55.2%) patients carried viruses with DRMs to one\n(29.9%), two (20.9%) or three (4.5%) ARV families. None of the patients\nwith the three regions available presented DRMs to the four drug\nfamilies. DRMs to NRTIs were identified in 57.8% (95% CI, 43.3--71) of\nthe available *pol* sequences, DRMs to NNRTIs in 37.8% (95% CI,\n25.1--52.4), major DRMs to PIs in 4.3% (95% CI, 0.8--14.5), minor DRMs\nto PIs in 10.9% (95% CI, 4.7--23), major DRMs to INSTIs in 6% (95% CI,\n2.3--14.4) and minor DRMs to INSTIs in 7.5% (95% CI, 3.2--16.3).\nDual-class NRTI + NNRTI resistance was present in 13.3% (95% CI,\n6.3--26.2) of the available sequences (Figure ​ (Figure1 1 ).\n\nAll 62 children/adolescents treated with *pol* sequence had received\nNRTIs, 45.2% non-NRTIs, 95.2% PIs and only 11 (17.7%) INSTIs. Despite\nthe use of ART, all treated children/adolescents with *pol* sequence\nshowed virological failure (VL \\> 50 copies/mL). Among them, 34 (54.8%)\ncarried resistant strains, with major DRMs to one (40.3%), two (9.7%) or\nthree (4.8%) ARV families (Table S1 ). Most of them harboured DRMs to\nNRTIs \\[58.5% (95% CI, 43.4--72.2)\\] or NNRTIs \\[39% (95% CI,\n25.7--54.3)\\], but also major DRMs to PIs \\[4.9% (95% CI, 0.9--16.1)\\]\nand to INSTIs \\[6.5% (95% CI, 2.5--15.4)\\] (Figure ​ (Figure1). 1 ).\nDual-class NRTI + NNRTI and NNRTI + PI resistance appeared in 12.2% (95%\nCI, 5.3--25.5) and 2.6% (95% CI, 0.1--13.2) of patients, respectively.\nTwo naive subjects carried viruses resistant to NRTIs and NRTI + NNRTI,\nrespectively. None of the six ART-treated subjects with VL ≤ 1000\ncopies/mL carried DRMs in available *pol* sequence.\n\nIn the five ART-naive children/adolescents at sampling, no major or\nminor DRMs to PIs or INSTIs was found. However, two (50%) of the four\nnaive subjects with RT sequence presented TDR to RT inhibitors, one\nchild to NRTI + NNRTI and another to NRTIs (Figure ​ (Figure1). 1 ).\nGlobal major TDR prevalence for both NRTIs and NNRTIs was 25% according\nto the WHO TDR list 2009. When analysed by Stanford v9.0, TDR prevalence\nto NNRTIs was maintained (25%), increasing to 50% to NRTIs. One child\ncarried A62V, V75I (NRTIs) and K103N (NNRTIs), while the other child\npresented M41L (NRTIs). None had received prior prophylaxis.\n\nFigure ​ Figure2 2 shows DRMs to the four main ARV families found in the\n67 HIV-infected children/adolescents with available *pol* sequence, and\nTable S2 provides data comparing naive versus treated paediatric\npatients. Among the 57.8% subjects carrying DRMs to NRTIs, the most\nfrequent DRM was M184V (48.9%), followed by T215F/Y/D (6.7%) and M41L\n(4.4%). Among the 37.8% of those carrying DRMs to NNRTIs, the most\nprevalent changes were K103N/S (31.1%), E138G/A (6.7%) and\nV106M/I/K101E/P/G190Q/A (4.4% each). Major and minor DRMs to PIs were\nidentified in 6 (13%) of 46 subjects with PR sequence, 2 of them\npresenting major DRMs (I54V, L90M and V82A) and 5 with minor DRMs. Among\nthe 8 (11.9%) subjects carrying resistant viruses with DRMs to INSTIs of\nthe 67 with IN sequence, 4 were infected with viruses harbouring major\nDRMs (Y143R, G140S/R, E138A and G148H) and 5 with minor DRMs.\n\nFigure 2.\n\nDRMs to the main ARV families in the study population. Available\nsequences in 67 children/adolescents under study: 46PR, 45RT and 67IN.\nWe considered major and minor DRMs to PIs, INSTIs, NRTIs and NNRTIs,\naccording to Stanford v9.0. More data are available in Table S2 . This\nfigure appears in colour in the online version of *JAC* and in black and\nwhite in the print version of *JAC* .\n\nAmong the 71 treated children/adolescents, 14 (19.7%) had failed more\nthan three different ART regimens at sampling. Eleven out of 14 had\navailable *pol* sequence and two-thirds of them (63.6%) presented DRMs\nto NRTIs (57.1%) and NNRTIs (28.6%) and major DRMs to PIs (33.3%) and\nINSTIs (18.2%) (Table S3 ). The rate of subjects carrying DRMs to the\nmain ARV families was higher (63.6%) in those under four or more ART\nregimens at sampling (Table S3 ).\n\nThe DRM prevalence to the main ARV families found in the 11\nHIV-1-infected treated children/adolescents with INSTI experience (all\nwith raltegravir) is shown in Table ​ Table2. 2 . Among the sequenced\nviruses, 5 carried DRMs to NRTIs (M184V or K70R), 2 to NNRTIs (P225H\nand/or K103N), 1 to PIs (I54V and V82A, major DRMs) and 2 to INSTIs\n(Y143R, major DRM).\n\nAvailable sequences in 11 treated children/adolescents from Panama under\nstudy with experience to INSTIs: 8PR, 8RT, 11IN.

The specific DRMs found to\nthe four main ARV families are summarized in Table ​ Table4, 4 , the most\nprevalent changes being M184V (six patients) and K103N (two patients) in\nRT and Y143R (two subjects) in IN.\n\nAvailable sequences in eight treated children/adolescents from Panama\nunder study carrying DRMs to INSTIs: 6PR, 7RT, 8IN.

When considering intermediate and high\nresistance levels, half of the population (53.3%) were infected with\nviruses resistant to NRTIs, 33.3% to NNRTIs, 6.5% to PIs and 6% to\nINSTIs. In more detail, viruses presented high/intermediate resistance\nto: emtricitabine and lamivudine (48.9% each); efavirenz and nevirapine\n(33.3% each); doravirine (8.9%); nelfinavir (6.5%); raltegravir (6%);\nand zidovudine, rilpivirine and etravirine (6.7% each), among others.\nMost children/adolescents with available *pol* sequences in Panama were\ninfected with viruses susceptible to PIs (91.3%) and INSTIs (88.1%),\nrepresenting interesting alternatives for rescue ART regimens if\nrequired.\n\nFigure 3.\n\nPredicted ARV susceptibility by Stanford in HIV-1-infected children and\nadolescents in Panama with available *pol* sequence from samples\ncollected during 2018--19.

This\nfigure appears in colour in the online version of *JAC* and in black and\nwhite in the print version of *JAC* .\n\n### HIV-1 viral variants in the study cohort\n\nMost (97%) paediatric subjects from Panama with *pol* sequence under\nstudy were infected with HIV-1 subtype B, except two treated subjects,\none carrying subtype G and the other carrying URF_A1B. Among them, no\ntransmission clusters were found.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study provides the most recent data on resistance to ARVs among\nHIV-infected children and adolescents in Panama and it is the first to\nreport resistance data for INSTIs in Panama, which is appropriate after\nthe broad implementation of dolutegravir.\n\nTreatment options for children and adolescents lag behind those for\nadults, making outcomes consistently worse. ^32^ Regarding specific\ndrugs, HIV treatment guidelines recommend an oral INSTI as the preferred\nARV for individuals initiating therapy because of their efficacy in\ncontrolling VL, safety and ease of use. ^33^ Dolutegravir is a\nsecond-generation HIV INSTI that has proven effective in trials\ninvolving adults, ^34\\ ,\\ 35^ being rapidly rolled out in national\ntreatment programmes. INSTI-based regimens are nowadays considered the\nfirst choice in paediatric clinical guidelines. ^36\\ ,\\ 37^ Recently, a\nclinical trial showed that dolutegravir-based therapy was superior to\nthe standard of care in children and adolescents as first- and\nsecond-line therapy. ^38^ Dolutegravir-based ART also presented an\nexcellent profile leading to a high rate of virological suppression in a\nSpanish cohort of HIV-infected children and adolescents. ^39^\n\nAt the time of sampling, the basis of paediatric ART in Panama was\ntriple therapy with zidovudine + lamivudine + lopinavir/ritonavir. ^40^\nIn children over 3 years old, the use of efavirenz was considered,\nalthough the majority continued to be treated with lopinavir/ritonavir.\nSince 2013, the combination of tenofovir + emtricitabine + efavirenz was\nused for older patients. They also employed darunavir and raltegravir as\nrescue regimens. In our study paediatric cohort, none of the 11\nINSTI-exposed children and adolescents under virological failure had\nreceived dolutegravir, since it was not included in clinical guidelines\nin Panama at the time of the study. ^40^ It was not until 2020 that\nlopinavir/ritonavir was replaced by dolutegravir for children and\ntenofovir + lamivudine + dolutegravir was switched for adolescents and\nadults.\n\nThere is a lack of updated data regarding the circulation of resistant\nstrains in the country. Only four studies reported data on HIVDR in\nPanama with samples collected during 2004--13, summarized in Table ​\nTable5 5 . ^22--24\\ ,\\ 41^ Only one of them analysed TDR in 25\nHIV-infected naive children sampled during 2007--09, reporting TDR to RT\ninhibitors in 12% of them, with two children presenting TDR to NRTIs and\none DRM to NNRTIs. ^41^ Our study found high DRM prevalence among\ntreated subjects, showing that one in two ART-experienced patients under\ntherapeutic failure with available *pol* sequence carried resistant\nstrains. Moreover, one out of three subjects presented intermediate- or\nhigh-level resistance to efavirenz and nevirapine, and one in two to\nemtricitabine and lamivudine. None of the naive children showed high- or\nintermediate-level resistance to any ARV, except for one child who\nharboured viruses resistant to efavirenz and nevirapine. Interestingly,\nmost patients with sequenced viruses were susceptible to INSTIs (88.1%)\nand PIs (91.3%). These findings support alternative ART regimens based\non PIs and INSTIs instead of RT inhibitors in HIV-infected children and\nadolescents in this country, mainly in those under therapeutic failure.\nOur findings also manifest the need to detect HIVDR in both the naive\nand treated paediatric populations of Panama to optimize first and\nrescue ART for those subjects carrying resistant viruses.\n\nAmong the 54.8% of treated children with sequence carrying DRMs in the\nstudy population during 2018--19, we found major DRMs to NRTIs (58.5%),\nNNRTIs (39%), INSTIs (6.5%) and PIs (4.9%). Although there are no\nrecords of DRMs in the treated HIV-infected paediatric population of\nPanama, the observed DRM prevalence in the treated study cohort sampled\nduring 2018--19 (54.8%) was lower than published data in the general\npopulation during 2007--13 (87.6%), ^23^ which was higher than the 9.7%\nreported in adults between 2004 and 2005. ^24^ The use of NNRTI- and\nNRTI-based regimens as first-line ART in children leads to an increase\nin the selection of resistant viruses. These two ARV families are\nreaching higher resistant levels in people on ART, which may jeopardize\nthe recycling of NRTIs as second-line ART. ^1^ Thus, new ART guidelines\npromote the use of an INSTI in the first-line therapy, with less\ntoxicity and a higher genetic barrier.\n\nIn the study cohort, two children and nine adolescents were\nINSTI-experienced with raltegravir on their rescue ART regimen, with\nonly two adolescents carrying Y143R (IN), a major DRM providing high\nresistance to raltegravir (Table ​ (Table2); 2 ); all of them were\nsusceptible to bictegravir and dolutegravir (Figure S1 ). However, we\nstill found that eight treated children/adolescents carried major and\nminor DRMs to INSTIs (Table ​ (Table4), 4 ), probably transmitted by the\nHIV-infected mother, as most acquired HIV infection by the vertical\nroute, compromising alternative conventional treatment options.\nUnfortunately, the ART data and resistance profiles of the mothers were\nnot available to confirm INSTI exposure and the presence of DRMs. One\n14-year-old female adolescent was under her first ART regimen with\nemtricitabine (NRTI) and efavirenz (NNRTI) but presented high resistance\nto the five INSTIs under study and to some NRTI and NNRTI drugs (Figure\nS1 ). This adolescent died before the results were delivered and the\nmother's resistance profile was unknown.\n\nAs expected, adolescents had experienced more treatment failures than\nchildren at sampling (Table S3 ), with a higher percentage of them on\ntheir third or more different ART regimens (62.2%). Meanwhile, all 29\ntreated children under study were under their first or second line.\nAccording to Table S3 , one-third of adolescents under four or more ART\nregimens at sampling did not harbour resistance viruses, suggesting a\nlack of adherence to treatment.\n\nRegarding adherence, we observed that half (45.2%) of treated subjects\nwith *pol* sequence under study (10/25 children, 18/37 adolescents)\nshowed adherence failure to ART, since they were under virological\nfailure (\\>50 copies/mL) without resistant viruses (Table S1 ),\nsuggesting the need to reinforce the adherence in these groups to\nprevent treatment dropouts. A previous study conducted in Panama\nanalysed factors associated with adherence to ART in HIV-1-infected\nadolescents, highlighting psychological status, behaviour, adult\nsupervision and social context, among others. ^42^ It also emphasizes\nthe need to identify these factors that influence the lack of adherence\nin adolescents to control the HIV infection in this risk population.\n\nNRTI and NNRTI resistance levels in people starting ART are a health\nconcern, as their prevalence among naive infants is over 10% in some\ncountries with NNRTI-based first-line ART. ^1^ Latin American countries\nhave reported moderate levels of TDR (\\<10%) in adults: 5.7% in El\nSalvador, ^27^ 5.8% in Colombia, ^43^ 6.8% in Mexico (NRTIs: 4.2%,\nNNRTIs: 2.5%, PIs: 1.7%), ^44^ 7.0% in Honduras (NRTIs: 3%, NNRTIs: 5%,\nPIs: 0.5%), ^45^ 7.3% in Guatemala (NRTIs: 1.8%, NNRTIs: 4.9%, PIs: 1%),\n^46^ and 9.5% in Brazil (NRTIs: 3.6%, NNRTIs: 5.8%), ^47^ with an\noverall TDR prevalence of 7.7% in Latin America. ^48^ Compared with\nprevious reports, TDR prevalence in Panama has been changing from 0% in\n2005, ^24^ 12% in 2007--09 ^41^ and 9.2% in 2007--13 ^23^ to 40% in\n2018--19 (depending on the TDR list) in the present study. However, due\nto the low number of sequences for TDR analysis, new studies with larger\nstudy cohorts of ART-naive subjects should be performed in future for a\nbetter estimation of TDR prevalence in the HIV-infected paediatric\npopulation in Panama. Consequently, continuous molecular epidemiological\nsurveillance of HIV-1 Latin American epidemics is crucial to determine\nwhether TDR prevalence in this region and country will remain stable or\nnot in the following years.\n\nOur results showed that one out of four naive children/adolescents at\nsampling presented TDR to NRTIs according to both the WHO and Stanford\nv9.0 lists. However, TDR prevalence to NRTIs was twice as high by\nStanford versus WHO (50% versus 25%), reinforcing the need for a WHO TDR\nlist 2009 update. In fact, the Stanford v9.0 algorithm includes some\npolymorphic DRMs absent in the WHO TDR list, such as V75I and A62V at RT\n(present in our study cohort), both affecting NRTI, as well as others\nproviding resistance to one or more NNRTI drugs, such as V106I, E138A,\nV179D/E/T and K238N, among others.\n\nDRMs to NRTIs and NNRTIs are approaching alarming resistance levels. The\nincrease in drug-resistant viruses leads to a lack of viraemia control,\nwith a consequent rise in virological failure cases. The delay in ART\nfailure identification due to resistant viruses can lead to DRM\naccumulation, affecting the rescue treatment efficacy, and decreasing\nCD4 counts in patients. Considering these facts, the WHO recommends that\ncountries where the national prevalence of resistance to the NNRTIs\nefavirenz or nevirapine in populations initiating first-line ART exceeds\n10% should consider transitioning to an alternative ARV drug, such as\ndolutegravir, as opposed to NNRTI-based first-line therapy. ^49^\n\nRegarding HIV-1 variants circulating in Panama, subtype B was the\npredominant variant in our study, as previously reported, ^22--24^\nalthough non-B variants were also identified in samples collected before\n2013: CRF02_AG/A3 and CRF12_BF/B, ^24^ URFs_BC, CRF20_BG and\nCRF28/29_BF. ^22^ We identified subtype G and URF_A1B strains in two\nchildren. HIV-1 non-B variants increased from 1.1% and 1.5% to 3%\n(present study), ^22\\ ,\\ 24^ suggesting that the prevalence of non-B\nvariants in Panama may increase in the following years. Since HIV-1\ngenetic variability can affect ART monitoring, leading to VL\nunderestimation or RNA detection failure in some cases, ^19\\ ,\\ 50^\nperiodic HIV-1 molecular epidemiology studies in the country could be\nuseful.\n\nThe high (\\>10%) DRM prevalence to NRTIs and NNRTIs observed among\ntreated HIV-infected children/adolescents in Panama justifies the need\nfor routine resistance monitoring for optimal rescue therapy selection\nin this vulnerable population. These results also reinforce the need to\nfast-track the transition to dolutegravir-based first-line regimens and\nto use PI-based ART when dolutegravir cannot be administered, following\nWHO recommendations. ^1^ These measures would help to control the spread\nof resistant HIV and to reach the 95:95:95 UNAIDS targets in Panama.\nFurthermore, HIVDR monitoring will help to identify which treatment\nfailure cases are due to resistant viruses or adherence failure. It will\nallow for a switch to an appropriate salvage therapy in patients\ninfected by resistant strains or to strengthen adherence if ART failure\nis caused by poor adherence to treatment. This will also help us to\noptimize second-line ART in treated patients harbouring DRMs and to\nestablish the most appropriate first-line ART in naive subjects.\n\n## Funding\n\nThis work was supported by programa CYTED (PLANTAIDS network 218RT0548).\nThe study was part of the research supported by the Spanish HIV infected\nPaediatric Cohort (CoRISpe) integrated in the Spanish AIDS Research\nNetwork, by Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Spanish Health Ministry\n(Grant no.

Genotyping was done on dried blood spot and/or plasma of participants with high HIV VL (≥1000 copies/mL). HIV genes (reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase) were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. The Stanford HIVDR Database was used for HIVDR interpretation.\nResults\nHIVDR genotyping was performed on blood samples from 137 participants (92 children and 45 adults) with VL ≥ 1000 copies/mL. The overall prevalence of HIV DRMs was 75.1%, with DRMs present in 78.4% of children and 57.8% of adults. Importantly, 5.8% of participants had INSTI DRMs including major DRMs: Q148K, E138K, G118R, G140A, T66A and R263K. NNRTI, NRTI and PI DRMs were also detected in 62.8%, 44.5% and 8% of participants, respectively. All the participants with major INSTI DRMs harboured DRMs targeting NRTI backbone drugs.\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

All naive HIV-1-infected children who initiated a combination of two NRTIs and one NNRTI between September 2006 and October 2007 in one of the two HIV-dedicated clinics of the Gabriel Toure Hospital were enrolled in this study. Ninety-seven HIV-1-infected children who started two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) (mainly zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine) in Mali were prospectively studied. Following national and WHO recommendations at the time of the study, the first-line regimen for children of all ages was an association of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI): zidovudine or stavudine plus lamivudine plus nevirapine or efavirenz.\nRationale: The paper mentions that all naïve children were initiated a combination of two NRTIs and one NNRTI between 2006 and 2007. 97 HIV-1 infected children started two NRTI and NNRTI in Mali were studied.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 36016383\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be transmitted via parenteral, sexual, or vertical exposure routes. The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals.

Participants\nswitching either TAF/FTC + DTG or TDF/FTC/EFV to TDF/3TC/DTG showed\nstatistically significant reductions in weight, low-density lipoprotein,\ntriglycerides, glucose and glycated hemoglobin.\n\n\n\n## METHODS\n\n### Study Setting\n\nCHARACTERISE enrolled residents of inner-city Johannesburg from July to\nNovember 2022 who had previously been part of ADVANCE and were not\npregnant at the time of screening.\n\n### Study Design\n\nCHARACTERISE evaluated outcomes after a minimum of 52 weeks of\nopen-label TDF/3TC/DTG. Results were evaluated for weight, lipids,\nfasting glucose, hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), systolic/diastolic blood\npressure, and HIV RNA. Participants with elevations in HIV RNA were\nretested at least 1 month after adherence counseling. The methods of\nanalysis followed the usual procedures for ADVANCE, as described in\nprevious publications \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Results for changes in weight and\nmetabolic parameters are displayed as median and interquartile range.\nChanges within each treatment group were evaluated using the paired\nnonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test.\n\nThe trial was approved by the University of the Witwatersrand Human\nResearch Ethics Committee and received local regulatory approval. All\npatients provided informed consent before any study procedures.\n\n### Role of Funding Source\n\nUnitaid contributed to the study design of CHARACTERISE.\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\nOf 1053 patients who were randomized to ADVANCE, 172 participated in\nCHARACTERISE. Results from CHARACTERISE are available for 70 of the 351\nparticipants originally in the TAF/FTC + DTG arm at the end of ADVANCE,\n71 of the 351 participants in the TDF/FTC + DTG arm, and 31 of the 351\nparticipants in the TDF/FTC/EFV arm. Part of the reason for the low\nnumber in the TDF/FTC/EFV arm was that the local clinics were still\ntransitioning to TDF/3TC/DTG, with much residual stock, and it appeared\nthe local nurses elected to continue EFV-based ART in many of these\npatients rather than switch to TDF/3TC/DTG. Overall, patients in\nCHARACTERISE were similar to those not enrolled, in terms of sex ( *P* =\n.10), CD4 ( *P* = .18), and HIV RNA ( *P* = .93). However, there were\nsignificant differences in their weight ( *P* = .0023). The mean weight\nof participants in CHARACTERISE was 79 kg and the mean weight of\nparticipants who did not enroll in CHARACTERISE was 74 kg.\n\nIn the CHARACTERISE study, baseline demographics were similar across the\noriginal randomized arms ( Table 1 ). Participants were 62% female, 100%\nBlack, and 34% from outside of South Africa. Amongst the 34% who were\nfrom outside South Africa, 50 were from Zimbabwe, 2 from Malawi, 3 from\nMozambique, and 4 from other regions. The median baseline CD4 count was\n570.5 cells/µL \\[interquartile range: 422-795\\] with 98% having HIV RNA\n\\<50 copies/mL.\n\n### Weight\n\nFor women switching from TAF/FTC + DTG to TDF/3TC/DTG after week 192,\nthere was a statistically significant reduction in weight (median: −1.6\nkg, *P* = .0125). This change in weight was not significant in men\n(median: −0.2 kg, *P* = .2561). There was a statistically significant\nreduction in body mass index (BMI) for women (median: −0.57 kg/m ^2^ ,\n*P* = .0106) but not men (median: −0.08, *P* = .2473).\n\nParticipants switching from TDF/FTC/EFV to TDF/3TC/DTG showed a\nsignificant increase in body weight (median: + 2.9, *P* = .02) and BMI\n(median: + 1.01, *P* = .0225). This change in weight was significant for\nthe subset of men (median: +2.3, *P* = .0464) but not women (median:\n+2.9, *P* = .1127).\n\nFor participants in the TDF/FTC + DTG arm switching to TDF/3TC/DTG,\nthere was no significant change in weight and BMI for either women or\nmen.\n\n### Lipids, Glucose, Blood Pressure, and HbA1C\n\nParticipants switching from TAF/FTC + DTG to TDF/3TC/DTG after week 192\nshowed significant reductions in total cholesterol ( *P* = .0018),\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL; *P* \\< .001), triglycerides ( *P* =\n.0254), glucose ( *P* = .0003), and HbA1C ( *P* = .0004). The reduction\nin high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and increase in systolic and diastolic\nblood pressure was not significant. Participants switching from\nTDF/FTC/EFV to TDF/3TC/DTG showed significant decreases in total\ncholesterol ( *P* = .0113), LDL ( *P* = .0012), HDL ( *P* = .0495),\ntriglycerides ( *P* = .0575), and HbA1C ( *P* = .0082). The reduction in\nglucose and increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was not\nsignificant. For participants switching from TDF/FTC + DTG to\nTDF/3TC/DTG, there was a significant increase in total cholesterol ( *P*\n= .0009), HDL ( *P* = .0209), and systolic blood pressure ( *P* =\n.0206). However, changes in LDL, triglycerides, glucose, HbA1C, and\ndiastolic blood pressure were not significant.\n\n### HIV RNA\n\nAfter at least 52 weeks on TDF/3TC/DTG, HIV RNA was undetectable in\n68/68 (100%) participants originally in the TAF/FTC + DTG arm, 68/70\n(97%) participants in the TDF/FTC + DTG arm, and 25/28 (89%) in the\nTDF/FTC/EFV arm. There were 8 elevations in HIV RNA. Of these, 3\nparticipants resuppressed after adherence counseling. However, 1\nparticipant did not resuppress and 4 did not return for their scheduled\nfollow-up visit.\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nMillions of people with HIV worldwide have switched from TDF/3TC/EFV or\nsimilar regimens to TDF/3TC/DTG in the past 5 years. In the CHARACTERISE\nstudy, participants who switched from TDF/FTC/EFV to TDF/3TC/DTG gained\na median 2.9 kg. We also saw small improvements in LDL cholesterol,\ntriglycerides, fasting glucose, and HbA1C during the switches from\nTDF/FTC/EFV to TDF/3TC/DTG. Again, this change is expected, given the\npreviously described metabolic effects of EFV \\[ 4 \\].\n\nWomen who switched from TAF/FTC + DTG to TDF/3TC/DTG lost a median of\n1.6 kg, and overall, this cohort had a slightly improved glucose and\nlipid profile. The results from CHARACTERISE are consistent with those\nseen in other observational studies from Finland and Germany in 292 and\n385 participants, respectively \\[ 10 , 11 \\].\n\nWith weight gain persisting as a potentially major health complication\nwith the use of all modern ART, risks for the development of long-term\ncardiac disorders remain of concern. A previously published analysis on\nthe 5- and 10-year risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes was\nconducted on the same ADVANCE population at week 96. This demonstrated\nthat participants on the TAF/FTC + DTG regimen had significantly greater\nrisk scores for development of cardiovascular disease or diabetes,\ndriven by weight gain, in comparison to the TDF-containing groups \\[ 12\n\\]. A switch from TAF to TDF may be clinically justified in patients,\nespecially women experiencing weight gain and those with glucose or\nlipid disorders, although it is unclear whether this weight loss will be\nmaintained, or whether other weight loss measures will be required.\n\nLimitations of the CHARACTERISE study include the open-label design and\nthe relatively small sample size: only 16% of the original 1053\nparticipants participated in the trial extension, so the statistical\npower to evaluate effects of switching in women and men is limited.\nThere was low participation by men, reflective of attrition to HIV care\nof men in HIV programs. There is potential for selection bias in those\nwho chose to participate in CHARACTERISE versus those who did not. The\ntrial was conducted in inner-city Johannesburg, with participants coming\nfrom across the region and recruited from routine patient care, factors\nthat strengthen the generalizability of the study. This trial was also\nconducted in a region of highest global genetic diversity. However, this\nstudy should be repeated in Asian, Hispanic, and Caucasian populations.\n\nCurrent World Health Organization recommendations for TDF/3TC/DTG as the\npreferred first-line regimen appear to be further substantiated by our\nstudy and are very reassuring for the participants switched from\nEFV-based regimens. Ultimately, countries such as Botswana that are\nmoving away from TDF/3TC/DTG in favor of TAF/FTC + DTG may want to\nconsider preservation of TDF-containing regimens as an option for\npatients with ongoing, significant weight gain and metabolic disease,\nwhich, sadly, is a significant proportion of this population.\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n\n***Financial support.*** Unitaid, U.S. Agency for International\nDevelopment (USAID), the South African Medical Research Council, and\nViiV Health Care, with investigational products provided by ViiV Health\nCare and Gilead Sciences, with salary support to W.

Reverse\ntranscriptase and INSTI sequences were provided by participating\ncenters. To evaluate the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance\nmutations (SDRM), we used the calibrated population resistance tools\nfrom the Stanford HIV website. To evaluate CRR, defined as any\nresistance level ≥3, we used the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database\nv.9.1 algorithm.\n\nResults\n\nWe included 2705 PWH, 72% men, median age of 37 years (interquartile\nrange, 30--48); 43.7% were infected by non-B subtypes. The prevalence of\nINSTI-SDRMs was 0.30% (T66I, T66A, E92Q, E138T, E138K, Y143R, S147G,\nR263K; all n=1) and the prevalence of NRTI-SDRMs was 5.77% (M184V:\n0.85%; M184I: 0.18%; K65R/N: 0.11%; K70E: 0.07%; L74V/I: 0.18%; any\nthymidine analog mutations: 4.36%). INSTI-CRR was 2.33% (0.15%\ndolutegravir/bictegravir, 2.29% raltegravir/elvitegravir) and 1.74% to\nfirst-line NRTIs (0.89% tenofovir/tenofovir alafenamide, 1.74% abacavir,\n1.07% lamivudine/emtricitabine).\n\nConclusions\n\nWe present the most recent data on TDR to integrase-based first-line\nregimens in Europe. Given the low prevalence of CRR to second-generation\nintegrase inhibitors and to first-line NRTIs during 2018--2021, it is\nunlikely that newly diagnosed PWH in MeditRes countries would present\nwith baseline resistance to a first-line regimen based on\nsecond-generation integrase inhibitors.\n\n\n## METHODS\n\nMeditRes HIV is a consortium that includes ART-naive PWH in France,\nGreece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain who have been newly diagnosed during\n2018--2021.\n\nFor this study, participating sites were asked to provide a FASTA viral\nsequence, encoding the HIV integrase and RT obtained at the time of\ninclusion. All naive PWH consequently diagnosed during the study period\nfrom the participating centers with an available sample were included.\nThe integrase region from HIV was sequenced using different protocols at\ntesting sites, including the Sanger sequencing--based assay and\nnext-generation sequencing (NGS)--based assay. For NGS sequences, a 20%\nconsensus was generated and used for this study. The Stanford HIV\ndatabase (version 9.1) was used for sequence alignment, quality\nassessment, resistance interpretation, and subtype assignment. To\nevaluate the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations\n(SDRMs), we used the calibrated population resistance (CPR) tools\n(integrase and RT-Pro) available on the Stanford HIV website. To\nevaluate clinically relevant transmitted resistance, we used the\nStanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (HIVDB) v.9.1 algorithm.\nInformation on participating centers, their geographic localization, and\nthe sequencing method used (Sanger or NGS) is provided in Supplementary\nTable 1 .\n\nWe followed Stanford HIVDB recommendations to recategorize Stanford\nresistance interpretation into a 3-level category (resistant-R,\nsusceptible-S, and intermediate-I). The following codons in the RT that\nare related to NRTI activity were considered as mutations of interest:\n41, 65, 67, 69, 70, 74, 75, 77, 115, 116, 151, 184, 210, 215, and 219.\nAll codons of interest for NRTIs are also considered as SDRMs by the\nStanford CPR tool \\[ 17 \\]. The following codons in the integrase were\nconsidered as mutations of interest: **66** , 74, **92** , 97, **118** ,\n**121** , **138** , **140** , 142, **143** , 145, 146, **147** , **148**\n, 149, 151, 153, **155** , 157, 163, **230** , and **263** . Codons that\nare investigated as SDRMs in the integrase using Stanford CPR tools are\nbold and have been published elsewhere \\[ 18 \\].\n\nGender, age, country of origin, transmission route, CD4 count, viral\nload, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection\nwere recorded. Resistance was described using prevalence, and the\ncorresponding confidence intervals were calculated with an analytically\nderived variance estimator. Comparisons across groups of categorical\nvariables and linear trends over the study period were analyzed using\n*χ* ^2^ or Fisher exact tests; a *P* value \\<.05 was considered\nsignificant. Statistics were performed using R Studio and Graph Pad\nPrism V8 software.\n\nBefore entering national cohorts, ethics approval is obtained from each\nparticipating site, and written informed consent is obtained from PWH\nincluded in the study. In addition, for the MeditRes INSTI TDR\nSurveillance Programme, specific ethics approval was obtained from\nHospital Universitario San Cecilio´s Ethics Committee.\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\nClinical, demographic, and virologic characteristics of the 2705 PWH who\nwere included in the study are listed in Table 1 . Of note, most were\nmale (72.2%), men who have sex with men (43.0%), in the age range of\n30--50 years (45.3%), and originating from Europe (47.2%). Late\ndiagnosis (CD4 cell count \\<350 cells/mm ^3^ ) and viral load \\>100,000\ncopies/mL were frequent (44.9% and 44.2%, respectively), and 56.3% of\nPWH were infected by subtype B. Only a few PWH were coinfected by HBV\n(5.7%) or HCV (2.4%). Recruitment through the different calendar time\nperiods was as follows: 2018, n = 952; 2019, n = 933; 2020, n = 594; and\n2021, n = 226.\n\nA total of 358 integrase sequences (13%) only reached codon 170 because\nin some Spanish centers, especially during 2018 and 2019, an NGS\nprotocol that did not cover positions of interest 230 and 263 was used.\n\nThe prevalence of INSTI SDRMs was 0.30% (95%CI, 0.13%--0.59%; T66I, n =\n1; T66A, n = 1; E92Q, n = 1; E138T, n = 1; E138K, n = 1; Y143R, n = 1;\nS147G, n = 1; and R263K, n = 1). The prevalence of NRTI-SDRMs was 5.77%\n(95%CI, 4.92%--6.72%; M184V: n = 23, 0.85%; M184I: n = 5, 0.18%; K65R/N:\nn = 3, 0.11%; K70E: n = 2, 0.07%; L74V/I: n = 5, 0.18%; any Thymidine\nAnalog Mutations (TAMs): n = 118, 4.36%). These data, along with a\ndetailed description of TAMS, are listed in Supplementary Table 2 . Of\nnote, NRTI singleton mutations were present in 85 PWH (3.14%; 95%CI,\n2.52%--3.87%). As seen in Figure 1 , the prevalence of either INSTI or\nNRTI SDRMs was not significantly different across the 4-year study\nperiod. Interestingly, the prevalence of M184V/I remained stable from\n2018 (n = 9, 0.95%) to 2021 (n = 2, 0.88%), being 1.29% (n = 12) in 2019\nand 0.84% (n = 5) in 2020.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nPrevalence of INSTI and NRTI surveillance drug resistance mutations\nacross the 4-year study period. Abbreviations: INSTI, integrase strand\ntransfer inhibitor; NRTI, nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase\ninhibitor.\n\nClinically relevant resistance (CRR) data are presented in Table 2 .\nCRR, defined as any resistance level for Stanford interpretation ≥3, was\n2.33% (95%CI, 1.80%--2.97%) for INSTIs (0.15% to dolutegravir and\nbictegravir; 2.29% to raltegravir and elvitegravir) and 1.74% (95%CI,\n1.28%--2.31%) to the components of the NRTI backbones (tenofovir\ndifumarate/tenofovir alafenamide: 0.89% intermediate resistance, 0%\nfully resistant; abacavir: 1.41% intermediate resistance, 0.33% fully\nresistant; lamivudine/emtricitabine: 1.07% fully resistant). As shown in\nFigure 2 , the prevalence of either INSTI or NRTI CRR remained stable\nand was not significantly different from 2018 (INSTIs: n = 19, 2.00%;\nNRTIs: n = 14, 1.47%) to 2021 (INSTIs: n = 4, 1.77%; NRTIs: n = 4,\n1.77%), being 2.79% (n = 26) for INSTIs and 1.82% (n = 17) for NRTIs in\n2019 and 2.36% (n = 14) for INSTIs and 2.02% (n = 12) for NRTIs in 2020.\n\nFigure 2.\n\nPrevalence of INSTI and NRTI clinically relevant resistance across the\n4-year study period. Abbreviations: INSTI, integrase strand transfer\ninhibitor; NRTI, nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor.\n\nThe higher rate in the prevalence of CRR to INSTIs (2.33%, n = 63)\ncompared with SDRMs (0.30%, n = 8) was driven by the detection of\nmutations scored for resistance by the Stanford algorithm but that are\nnot on the CPR SDRM INSTI list. Additional mutations in the integrase\nresponsible for CRR were H51Y (n = 2), T97A (n = 2, in combination with\nS147G or S153F), S153F (n = 2), E157Q (n = 3, in combination with T97A,\nQ95K, or E138K), and G163K/N/R/T (n = 48). Additional mutations of\ninterest in the integrase that did not confer CRR were L74I (n = 294),\nL74M (n = 35), Q95K (n = 1), T97A alone (n = 44), G149A (n = 3), and\nE157Q alone (n = 57).\n\nFinally, a univariate analysis was performed to determine if any of the\navailable demographic, clinical, and virological variables were related\nto INSTI or NRTI SDRM or CRR to first-line drugs in these classes. Age\nwas significantly related to NRTI SDRMs and NRTI CRR. PWH aged \\<30\nyears had a higher risk for NRTI SDRMs (5.95% vs 3.35% PWH aged 30--50\nyears, *P* = .0103 vs 2.69% PWH aged \\>50 years, *P* = .0051) and NRTI\nCRR (3.15% vs 1.63% PWH aged 30--50 years, *P* = .0327 vs 1.11% PWH aged\n\\>50 years, *P* = .0127). In addition, females showed significantly more\nINSTI SDRMs (0.85%) than males (0.20%; *P* = .0263). Finally, being\ninfected by a non-B subtype was also associated with a higher risk of\ncarrying M184V and K219R mutations (1.27% and 1.02% vs 0.53% and 0.20%,\n*P* = .02 and *P* = .004, respectively) and with having CRR to\nsecond-generation integrase inhibitors (0.34% vs 0%, *P* = .02) and to\nlamivudine/emtricitabine (1.5% vs 0.72%, *P* = .05). A detailed\ndescription of the prevalence of mutations and CRR in B and non-B\ninfected PWH is shown in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 . For the\nremainder of the variables, no differences were observed.\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nIntegrase inhibitors, especially second-generation drugs in the class,\nare currently considered preferred first-line options for ART-naive PWH\nin many countries worldwide and are part of preferred regimes for rapid\nART start. Currently, there is a gap in up-to-date information on TDR to\nINSTIs in Europe, and most of the studies that provide data on TDR to\nthe accompanying NRTI backbones may be outdated. Here, we provide the\nmost recent data on INSTI and NRTI TDR in Europe. We describe a marginal\ntransmission of CRR to first-line drugs and a low prevalence of TDR\nduring 2018--2021. Our results show that it is unlikely that newly\ndiagnosed PWH in MeditRes countries would present with baseline\nresistance to a first-line regimen based on second-generation INSTIs\nand, therefore, may support rapid initiation without having the\ninformation regarding the resistance test if a second-generation\nintegrase first-line regimen is started.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the largest and most up-to-date study to show\nTDR to INSTIs in Europe \\[ 19--28 \\]. In this study, as in previous\nstudies conducted in Spain and Europe \\[ 29--32 \\], in addition to TDR,\nwe analyzed CRR, which could impact clinicians' choice of the first-line\nregimen, rather than SDRMs. As singleton mutations do not compromise the\nactivity of tenofovir difumarate/tenofovir alafenamide, abacavir, or\ndolutegravir and bictegravir, knowledge of the level of resistance\nrather than the mutations themselves is of utmost importance. To check\nfor CRR, we used the Stanford algorithm to tailor resistance levels to\nthe first-line drugs currently included in regimens in Europe. For the\nINSTIs, we found that only 4 of 2705 PWH (0.15%) showed mutations with\nsome level of resistance to dolutegravir and bictegravir. In contrast,\nCRR to the first-generation INSTIs, raltegravir and elvitegravir (n =\n62, 2.29%), was higher but still at low levels. We also found that 29\nPWH (1.07%) showed CRR to emtricitabine/lamivudine, 24 (0.89%) to\ntenofovir difumarate/tenofovir alafenamide (none being fully resistant),\nand 47 (1.74%) to abacavir (only 0.33% being fully resistant).\nInterestingly, none of the PWH who had CRR to second-generation INSTIs\nalso showed resistance to NRTIs. Also of interest is that these data\nwere consistent over the 4-year study period, as no differences were\nfound between years when linear trends were investigated.\n\nKnowledge of the level of CRR is key for rapid-start strategies that are\nnow being proposed as an option for ART \\[ 33--37 \\]. Our results show\nthat currently in Mediterranean Europe, it is extremely improbable that\nPWH would present with a fully resistant virus to more than 1 of the\ndrugs used as first-line regimens. Therefore, resistance testing should\nnot hamper rapid-start strategies. Second-generation INSTI-based\nfirst-line ART can be initiated without having to wait for resistance\ntesting results. However, in order to adhere to clinical guidelines and\nto provide data to monitor TDR, a baseline genotype must always be\nordered and evaluated when the results are received.\n\nAs in previous studies \\[ 29--32 \\], we found that evaluation of only\nSDRMs shows a very different picture from CRR. In the case of the\nINSTIs, the SDRM list misses some mutations that are important for CRR\nto first-generation INSTIs. In fact, in our study, up to 2.03% of PWH\nwith CRR had no SDRMs; these PWH harbored mutations such as H51Y, S153F,\nand G163K/N/R/T or combinations that included T97A or E157Q. In\naddition, some other mutations that we considered to be mutations of\ninterest in the integrase, based on the l'Agence nationale de recherches\nsur le sida (ANRS) algorithm, which is a highly recognized international\ninterpretation system, were also more prevalent.\n\nOn the contrary, for the NRTIs, the prevalence of SDRMs was higher than\nthe prevalence of CRR, which has been seen in other studies \\[ 32 , 38\n\\]. Here, the explanation relies on the fact that most PWH with SDRMs\npresented with singletons. In fact, only 1.22% of our study population\nshowed more than 1 NRTI transmitted mutation. Of note, only 0.33% of PWH\nshowed viruses with full resistance to abacavir (ABC) and none were\nfully resistant to tenofovir dfimurate/tenofovir alafenamide.\n\nNotably, younger PWH showed a higher prevalence of NRTI SDRMs and CRR,\nand females showed a higher prevalence of INSTI SDRMs. If confirmed by\nother studies, a higher circulation of NRTI resistance in younger PWH in\nEurope and of INSTI SDRMs in females may indicate that, if necessary,\nthese groups should be prioritized for resistance testing and may also\njustify that special consideration be given to NRTI resistance testing\nbefore prescription of regimens with a low genetic barrier to\nresistance. The higher prevalence of resistance among younger PWH may\nreflect a more recent diagnosis that is associated with lower risk for\nreversal to wild-type mutations. Interestingly, we observed a\nsignificant increased prevalence of M184V and of CRR to dolutegravir,\nbictegravir, and lamivudine/emtricitabine for PWH infected by non-B\nsubtypes. Although the prevalence is still very low in non-B types, our\nresults, if confirmed over time and in other studies, support the need\nfor continuous surveillance, especially in populations that may be\ninfected by non-B types.\n\nOur study has some limitations. First, although MeditRes HIV aimed to\ncollect data from PWH from France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain,\nthe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic made it very difficult\nfor Greece and Portugal to contribute. Consequently, our data may not be\nrepresentative of European countries other than those that reported on\nthe majority of PWH (France, Italy, and Spain). Second, our study design\nwas highly heterogeneous, as we collected data from routine resistance\ntesting in newly diagnosed PWH from participating countries, with\ndiverse intercountry sampling methods and representativeness. Third, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, as expected, made the numbers of PWH recruited\ndecrease for 2020 and, especially, for 2021. Finally, a minor subset of\nthe integrase FASTA sequences, provided mainly by the participating\ncenters in Spain, were obtained using next-generation assays that did\nnot cover positions 230 and 263. However, for the rest of our sequences\n(more than 85%), we did not detect any mutation in position 230 and only\n1 PWH with R263K.\n\nIn summary, we report that in Mediterranean Europe by the end of 2021,\nthe chances of being infected by a virus with any grade of resistance to\nan INSTI-based first-line regimen was very low. These findings suggest\nthat, currently, the evaluation of resistance data may not be an issue\nfor rapid initiation of an INSTI first-line--based regimen and can be\ndeferred until resistance data become available. However, baseline\nresistance should continue to be evaluated as a part of routine testing\nand national surveillance programs. These programs are needed to\ncontinuously monitor the trend in TDR to these and other antiretroviral\ndrugs, as well as for providing the HIV molecular information that is\nneeded for national HIV molecular epidemiology to be effective.\n\n\n***Financial support* .** This work was supported by ViiV Healthcare\n(unrestricted grant ISS 213211), and in part, by grants from Plan\nNacional de I + D + I and Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional-FEDER\n(RD16/0025/0040; RD16/0025/0026), Fundacion Progreso y salud, Junta de\nAndalucia (PI-0550-2017), Fondo Investigación en Salud-FIS (PI\n18/00819).

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals.

The remaining six individuals were prescribed either a combination of lamivudine and stavudine (3TC/d4T; n = 1), lamivudine and nevirapine (3TC/NVP; n = 2), Duovir and Stocrin (3TC/AZT and EFV; n = 2), or Stocrin alone (EFV; n = 1).\nRationale: The paper lists the specific drugs that were part of the treatment regimens for the individuals in  the study, including lamivudine, stavudine, nevirapine, zidovudine, and efavirenz, which includes both NRTI and NNRTI.\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI\n\nPMID: 35061671\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Materials and methods\nWe analyzed 1071 HIV-1 pol-gene fragment sequences (2253–3369 bp) from patients who were initiating or reinitiating first-line ART in six EECA counties, i.e., Armenia (n = 120), Azerbaijan (n = 96), Belarus (n = 158), Russia (n = 465), Tajikistan (n = 54), and Uzbekistan (n = 178), between 2017 and 2019. HIV Pretreatment DR (PDR) and drug resistance mutation (DRM) prevalence was estimated using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database. The PDR level was interpreted according to the WHO standard PDR survey protocols. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database and subsequently confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Transmission clusters were determined using Cluster Picker.\nResults\nAnalyses of HIV subtypes showed that EECA, in general, has the same HIV genetic variants of sub-subtype A6, CRF63_02A1, and subtype B, with different frequencies and representation for each country.\nThe prevalence of PDR to any drug class was 2.8% in Uzbekistan, 4.2% in Azerbaijan, 4.5% in Russia, 9.2% in Armenia, 13.9% in Belarus, and 16.7% in Tajikistan. PDR to protease inhibitors (PIs) was not detected in any country. PDR to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) was not detected among patients in Azerbaijan, and was relatively low in other countries, with the highest prevalence in Tajikistan (5.6%). The prevalence of PDR to nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was the lowest in Uzbekistan (2.8%) and reached 11.1% and 11.4% in Tajikistan and Belarus, respectively.\nGenetic transmission network analyses identified 226/1071 (21.1%) linked individuals, forming 93 transmission clusters mainly containing two or three sequences. We found that the time since HIV diagnosis in clustered patients was significantly shorter than that in unclustered patients (1.26 years vs 2.74 years). Additionally, the K103N/S mutation was mainly observed in clustered sequences (6.2% vs 2.8%).\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance and the genetic analysis of HIV-1 sequences from patient samples.

We determined the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity in Bulgaria during 2012--2020 using polymerase sequences from 1053 of 2010 (52.4%) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. Sequences were analyzed for DRM using the WHO HIV SDRM list implemented in the calculated population resistance tool at Stanford University. Genetic diversity was inferred using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetics. Cluster detection and characterization was performed using MicrobeTrace. The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%). Most (34/60, 56.7%) of the SDRMs were present in transmission clusters of different subtypes composed mostly of male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC), including a 14-member cluster of subtype B sequences from 12 MMSC and two males reporting heterosexual contact; 13 had the L90M PI mutation and one had the T215S NRTI SDRM. We found a low SDRM prevalence amid high HIV-1 diversity among ART-naive patients in Bulgaria during 2012--2020. The majority of SDRMs were found in transmission clusters containing MMSC, indicative of onward spread of SDRM in drug-naive individuals. Our study provides valuable information on the transmission dynamics of HIV drug resistance in the context of high genetic diversity in Bulgaria, for the development of enhanced prevention strategies to end the epidemic.\n\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity using sequences from ART-naive individuals.

Success was\nmeasured by the proportion of patients with plasma viral load \\< 50\ncopies/ml at W48 using the FDA snapshot algorithm. We also assessed risk\nfactors associated with virological failure (VF).\n\n### Results\n\n382 patients with HIV RNA \\< 50 copies/mL who switched to E/C/F/TDF were\nincluded in the study. Most patients (69.9%) were male, with median age\n44 years (IQR 38--51), who had been on ART for a median of 7 years (IQR\n4--13). Median CD4 count was 614/mm ^3^ and 24.6% of the patients had a\nhistory of previous virological failure. The reasons for switching were\nsimplification (67.0%) and tolerance issues (22.0%). At week 48, 314\n(82.0% \\[95% CI 78.4--86.0\\]) patients had HIV RNA \\< 50 copies/mL, 13\n(3.5% \\[95% CI 3.64--8.41\\]) experienced virological failure. Genotype\nat failure was available in 6/13 patients with detection of\nresistance-associated mutations to integrase inhibitors and NRTIs in 5/6\n(83.3%) patients. We found no predictive factor associated with\nvirological failure except for a borderline significance with the\nduration of viral suppression before the switch. Tolerability of\nE/C/F/TDF was good with 23/382 (6.0%) patients experiencing mild adverse\nreactions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn our cohort, switching well-suppressed patients to E/C/F/TDF resulted\nin few virologic failures and was well tolerated. However, resistance to\nintegrase inhibitors emerged in patients with virological failure.\n\n\n\n## Methods\n\nCOREVIH IDF Est is a group of 27 clinical centers located in the Paris\narea, with approximately 11,000 HIV-infected patients on follow-up in\n2014. All centers use the computerized Nadis® database as an electronic\nhealth record (EHR) for patient follow-up and care. Demographic data,\nclinical outcomes, ART history and laboratory tests (CD4 T cell count\nand HIV-1 RNA) are collected at each patient's visit by the clinician,\nthe rate of completion is monitored and is \\> 90%. In the EHR, the\nreason for any ART change has to be reported to be able to print the\npatient's prescription, so the reason for the switch is accurately\nreported.\n\n### Patients\n\nWe conducted a retrospective multicenter observational cohort study\nwithin the COREVIH IDF Est clinical centers enrolling ART-experienced\npatients. Eligible patients were adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with\ncontrolled HIV-1 infection on any stable ART regimen (no limit on the\nprevious number of regimens) who switched to E/C/F/TDF between February\n2014 (date of approval of E/C/F/TDF in France) and August 2015.\nControlled HIV-1 infection was defined by plasma HIV-1 RNA \\< 50\ncopies/mL without ART modification in the previous 12 months.\n\nBefore enrollment in the Nadis® database, it is required that patients\nsign an informed consent form which was approved by the Paris\nSaint-Louis ethics committee and Commission Nationale Informatique et\nLibertés (CNIL) allowing the use of patients' data for\nnon-interventional studies without the need for further consent in\naccordance with French regulations (CNIL, number 1,171,457).\n\n### Study procedures\n\nOur primary objective was to assess the efficacy and tolerance of the\nswitch to E/C/F/TDF measured by determination at W48 of the proportion\nof patients still on E/C/F/TDF and with plasma HIV-1 RNA \\< 50\ncopies/mL.\n\nAt baseline (date of the switch), the following data were extracted:\ndate of HIV infection, date of first ART, number of previous ART and\ntype of regimen, nadir CD4 T cell count or CD4 T cell count at ART\ninitiation, CD4 T cell count (within 6 months before the switch), the\nreason for switching to E/C/F/TDF, creatinine levels and estimated\nGlomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using MDRD, history of prior virologic\nfailure and previous genotypes. If the genotypes were not available in\nthe database for patients who failed (at baseline and at virological\nfailure), we went back to the paper chart or contacted the virology\nlaboratory to collect the information. During the study period,\ngenotypes were performed using Sanger sequencing. In France, it is\nusually recommended to perform genotyping in case of confirmed virologic\nfailure with HIV RNA ≥ 200 copies/mL.\n\nDuring the 48 weeks of follow-up, any reason for ART change was\ncollected, any plasma HIV-1 RNA measure between baseline and W48,\nclinical adverse events reported at each visit and creatinine levels at\nW48 were also collected.\n\n### Study endpoints\n\nOur primary endpoint was the proportion of success defined as plasma\nHIV-1 RNA \\< 50 copies/mL using the FDA snapshot algorithm \\[ 17 \\]. Due\nto the retrospective design of this real-life study, we defined a window\nperiod for the primary endpoint analysis of − 12 weeks/+ 24 weeks to\nlimit missing values.\n\nVirologic success was thus defined as plasma HIV-1 RNA below 50\ncopies/mL at week 48 with a window period of W36 to 72 weeks and no\ndiscontinuation of E/C/F/TDF.\n\nThe secondary endpoints were: reasons for the switch as reported in the\npatient's EHR (simplification, patient demand, tolerance, other or\nunknown); the proportion of patients with virological failure defined as\na confirmed viral load ≥ 50 copies/ml at two consecutive measurements\nwithin one year after the switch or one HIV RNA ≥ 50 copies and\nE/C/F/TDF discontinuation; resistant mutations in case of virologic\nfailure; reasons for treatment discontinuation after the switch and\ntolerability of the treatment; risk factors for virologic failure.\n\nOf note, INSTI resistance testing in ART-naïve patients before ART\ninitiation was not standard of care in France before 2014 but was\nperformed in case of virological failure since 2008.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nThe primary analysis was an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis using the FDA\nsnapshot algorithm at W48. Patients were classified in the following\ncategories: (i) virological success defined as plasma viral load \\< 50\ncopies/ml at W48 (time window W36-W72) while on E/C/F/TDF; (ii)\nvirologic failure: plasma viral load ≥ 50 copies/ml at any visit after\nthe switch; (iii) no data: missing data or lost to follow-up and\ndiscontinuation of E/C/F/TDF for reasons other than virologic failure at\na prior visit.\n\nData are presented as median with IQR for continuous variables and\nfrequencies with percentages for qualitative variables. Categorical\nvariables were compared using Fisher's exact tests while quantitative\nvariables were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.\n\nComparisons between patients with virological failure and virological\nsuccess were performed to assess if the following baseline risks factors\nwere associated with virological failure: age, gender, mode of HIV\ninfection acquisition, use of INSTI or PI/r before switch, time since\nHIV infection diagnosis, duration of ART, duration of viral suppression\nbefore the switch, nadir and baseline CD4 T cell counts, creatinine\nplasma level, previous resistance-associated mutations (RAM) to at least\none drug of the regimen.\n\nAll tests were two-sided at the 0.05 significance level. Analyses were\nperformed using R statistical package (version 3.2.2: the R Foundation,\nVienna, Austria).\n\n\n\n## Results\n\nAmong the 10,128 patients on ART during the study period, 661 were\nreceiving E/C/F/TDF and 382 were included in the present study. The two\nmain reasons for non-inclusion were patients receiving E/C/F/TDF as\ninitial ART regimen (n = 137) and HIV RNA ≥ 50 copies before the switch\n(n = 114). The study flow chart is reported in Fig. 1. Baseline\ncharacteristics of the patients are reported in Table 1 .\n\nPatients were mostly male (69.9%), with median age of 44 years, 42.0%\nwere born in Africa and 89.0% had been infected via sexual transmission\n(59% heterosexual and 40% men who have sex with men). At the time of the\nswitch to E/C/F/TDF, the median duration of HIV infection was 11 years\n(IQR: 5--16) and the median time from ART initiation was 7 years (IQR\n4--13). Before switching to E/C/F/TDF, a majority of patients received a\ncombination of two NRTI and a third agent: ritonavir- boosted PI (PI/r)\nin 195/382 (51.0%), NNRTI in 84/382 (22.0%) and INSTI in 67/382 (17.5%)\npatients. Other unconventional regimens were used in a small subset of\npatients: PI/r-based combinations in 16/382 (4.2%) or other combinations\nin 20/382 (5.2%) patients. The reason for switching was simplification\nfor 256/382 (67.0%) patients, tolerance issues for 85/382 (22.0%) and\nvarious other reasons for 41/382 (10.8%) of the patients.\n\n### Efficacy results (Table  2  )\n\n\nAt W48, using the FDA snapshot analysis, 314 (82.0% \\[95%CI\n78.4--86.0\\]) patients met the definition of success with HIV RNA \\< 50\ncopies/mL while still on E/C/F/TDF and 13 (3.5% \\[95%CI 3.64--8.41\\])\nexperienced virologic failure, 23 (6.0% \\[95%CI 3.6--8.4\\]) discontinued\nE/C/F/TDF due to an adverse event, 31 (8.2% \\[95%CI 5.6--11.4\\])\ndiscontinued treatment for other reasons or were lost to follow-up and 1\npatient died (myocardial infarction).\n\n### Virologic failure and resistance (Table  ​  (Table3    3  )\n\n\nThirteen (3.5%) patients experienced virologic failure: eight had an HIV\nRNA ≥ 50 copies before W48 and five at week 48.\n\nResults of genotypic resistance at the time of virologic failure were\navailable for six patients and not performed or not available for the\nseven remaining patients. Among the six patients with available\ngenotype, five had NRTI and INSTI RAMs. Out of these five patients,\ncomparison with genotype prior to the switch was possible in four: all\nhad NRTI RAMs and one had INSTI RAMs.\n\n### Risk factors for virologic failure (Table  4  )\n\n\nA genotypic test for resistance was available at baseline for nine of\nthe 13 patients with virologic failure (69.0%) and 143 of the 314\npatients with virologic success (46.0%).\n\nThere was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of\nbaseline characteristics or presence of resistance-associated mutations\nto NRTIs except that patients who experienced failure had undetectable\nviremia for a shorter period (21.9 vs. 33.6 months, p = 0.05). Among the\npatients who failed, M184V and other NRTI RAM conferring resistance to\nTDF were more frequent, but the difference was not statistically\nsignificant.\n\n### Safety results (data not shown)\n\nThere was a significant change in creatinine levels between the switch\nand W48 but not clinically meaningful: the median creatinine level was\n79 µmol/L (IQR 70--89) at baseline and 85 (IQR 75--96) at W48\n(p \\< 0.001); data not shown; among the 382 patients, 38 and 57\ncreatinine values were missing at baseline and W48 respectively.\n\nAll patients who discontinued E/C/F/TDF between the switch and W48 were\nanalyzed to describe reasons for treatment discontinuation and identify\nclinically significant adverse events leading to treatment\ndiscontinuation. Among the 43 treatment discontinuations, 23/43 (54.0%)\nwere related to mild adverse events: 10 gastro-intestinal, three renal\nadverse events and two mild transaminase elevation; other various\nadverse events were seen in eight patients (nightmares in two, fatigue\nor muscular pain in two, tachycardia in one and reason was not specified\nfor three patients). The three renal adverse events were laboratory\nabnormalities and patients were asymptomatic: one hypophosphatemia and\ntwo creatinine level elevation of less than 20%.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn our retrospective cohort study of PWH fully suppressed on ART, the\nproportion of patients maintaining a plasma HIV RNA level \\< 50\ncopies/mL one year after switching to E/C/F/TDF was 82.0%. This\nproportion remains however lower than that reported in randomized\nclinical trials where success rates above 93% have been reported with a\nswitch to E/C/F/TDF or E/C/F/TAF \\[ 8 , 9 , 18 -- 20 \\]. These\ndifferences can be explained in part by a higher rate of patients\ndiscontinuing the study drugs because of drug-related adverse events,\nlost to follow-up or other reasons in our study (14.0% ) as compared to\nprior randomized trials (4--6%) \\[ 8 , 9 , 19 \\]. Also, contrary to\nprior randomized studies, we allowed in our study patients with prior\nvirologic failure (24.6%), those with more than two different ART\nregimens before the switch (75.0%) and those with prior integrase\ninhibitors-based ART regimens (17.5%). Our study has therefore enrolled\npatients that are more representative of real-life practice.\n\nThese differences can also explain the higher rate of virologic failure\nin our study (3.5%) as compared to prior studies (1.0%) (Table 2 ) \\[ 8\n, 9 , 18 , 20 \\]. An additional reason for this higher rate of virologic\nnon response is that we allowed patients with prior NRTI or integrase\nresistance mutations to be enrolled, whereas these patients were\nexcluded from the analysis in prior randomized trials \\[ 8 , 9 \\].\nIndeed, in our study among 152 patients with an HIV resistance genotype\navailable before the switch, 31/152 (20.3%), and 17/152 (11.2%) had the\nM184V/I and M184V/I + at least one TDF-associated resistance mutation\nidentified, respectively (Table 3 ).\n\nWhen we assessed baseline risk factors associated with virologic\nfailure, we could not identify prior resistance associated mutations as\na significant risk factor, possibly because of the low number of\npatients with virologic failure. However, previous cohort studies have\nalso shown, that pre-existing NRTI resistance associated mutations were\nnot associated with the risk of emerging resistance \\[ 21 -- 25 \\].\nAmong 15 patients switching to E/C/F/TDF with previous mutations to\nFTC/TDF, only one experienced virological failure \\[ 23 \\]. In two\nstudies enrolling patients with M184V and receiving a TDF or\nabacavir-based regimen switching to elvitegravir based ART, there was no\nimpact of the presence of M184V on virologic success \\[ 22 , 24 \\].\n\nThe only factor we found associated with virologic failure was the\nduration of viral suppression before the switch which was 21.9 months in\nthose with virologic failure as compared to 33.6 months in those without\nvirologic failure (p = 0.05). This association between the duration of\nviral suppression and a lower risk of virologic failure is consistent\nwith prior studies \\[ 26 , 27 \\].\n\nOf interest, and contrary to randomized trials and cohort studies, we\nreport a high rate of integrase inhibitor-associated mutations in\npatients with virologic failure with 5/6 (83.3%) patients showing at the\ntime of failure the N155H (n = 4) or Q148H (n = 1) mutations (Table ​\n(Table3). 3 ). All five patients also had NRTI-associated resistance\nmutations which were already detected in genotypes before the switch in\nfour out of five patients. This contrasts with previous reports where\nintegrase inhibitor resistance was either not found at the time of\nfailure or identified in a single patient in one study \\[ 8 , 9 , 18 --\n20 \\]. Our results are consistent with a low genetic barrier to\nresistance with elvitegravir as compared to second- generation integrase\ninhibitors. There are no trials comparing face-to-face elvitegravir to\neither dolutegravir or bictegravir. However, the results of a previous\nstudy comparing elvitegravir/cobicistat to raltegravir in patients naïve\nto integrase inhibitor but failing current ART showed a similar\nvirologic failure rate with both regimens and a similar rate of\nemergence of resistance to integrase inhibitors (27% and 21%, with\nelvitegravir and raltegravir, respectively) \\[ 28 \\]. In addition, in a\nsimilar population, dolutegravir outperformed raltegravir with a lower\nrate of virologic failure, and fewer patients developed integrase\nresistance in case of virologic failure with dolutegravir as compared to\nraltegravir (4/45 (8.9%) vs. 17/21 (80.9%), respectively \\[ 29 \\]. These\nresults explain in part why elvitegravir is no longer recommended as a\npreferred integrase inhibitor in most guidelines \\[ 13 , 14 \\].\n\nIn our patients, the safety and tolerability of E/C/F/TDF were good. The\nrate of study drug discontinuation, remained low (6.0%) although higher\nthan in prior randomized studies and was due to mild adverse events or\nlaboratory abnormalities, such as gastro-intestinal-related adverse\nevents.\n\nOur study has however several of limitations. Due to its retrospective\ndesign, a number of data are missing, especially regarding prior\ngenotypic resistance tests. The low number of patients with virologic\nfailure also precluded a more detailed analysis of risk factors\nassociated with this outcome. Follow-up was short and the rate of study\ndiscontinuation was higher than in prospective studies.\n\nThe strength of our study is to have enrolled patients with different\ntreatment histories, and to provide an opportunity to better assess the\nantiviral activity and genetic barrier to resistance of E/C/F/TDF in\nthese difficult-to-treat patients in a real-world setting. Indeed, our\nresults underline the importance of analyzing in detailed treatment\nhistory when considering a switch to elvitegravir in well-suppressed\npatients. Caution is required with close monitoring of plasma HIV-1 RNA\nlevels, if patients have experienced previous treatment failure, have\nprior NRTI or integrase resistance mutations or no resistance genotype\navailable or in case of a short duration of viral suppression. In these\ncases, switching to a drug with a higher genetic barrier to resistance\nis advisable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Funding\n\nThis study was partially funded by Gilead (The Voice program Grant\n2015). Gilead had no role in the study design, data collection, data\nanalysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. NDC, AB, GH and\nJMM had full access to all the data during the study and had the final\nresponsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\n\n\n## Availability of data and materials\n\nData will not be shared publicly.

HIV-RNA &lt;50 copies/mL was analysed at 144 weeks in an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (missing = failure) and a per-protocol (PP) analysis (patients with missing data or changes for reasons other than virological failure were excluded).\nResults: The study population comprised 358 PWH (19% women). Median age and time with HIV infection were 51.7 and 13.4 years, respectively. The median number of previous antiretroviral combinations was three. Previous virological failure was reported in 27.1% of patients, and the M184V resistance mutation was detected in 17 patients. At 144 weeks, the percentage of individuals with HIV-RNA &lt;50 copies/mL was 77.4% (277/358) in the ITT analysis and 95.5% (277/290) in the PP analysis. A total of 68 participants were excluded from the PP analysis (data missing, 25, discontinuation due to toxicity, 19; other, 16; death, 8). Two people with virological failure selected resistance-associated mutations (M184V and M184V + R263K). HIV-RNA remained undetectable in 17 patients with a previous history of the M184V mutation.\nRationale: The paper focuses on the clinical outcomes and resistance mutations in patients but does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 37194419\nQuestion ID: 14\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?\nEvidence: We performed a retrospective review of treatment-experienced patients who started DTG + 3TC in a cohort of PWH. The study population comprised 358 PWH (19% women). Median age and time with HIV infection were 51.7 and 13.4 years, respectively. The median number of previous antiretroviral combinations was three. Previous virological failure was reported in 27.1% of patients, and the M184V resistance mutation was detected in 17 patients. Most of the patients (70.7%) switched from a previous combination that included two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus an integrase strand transcriptase inhibitor (INSTI) (63.7% DTG).\nRationale: The paper mentions that the study included treatment-experienced patients who started DTG + 3TC in a cohort of PWH, and the study population had median number of previous antiretroviral combinations was three, previous virological failure was reported in 27.1% of patients, most patients switched from a previous combination that included two NRTIs and INSTI.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 37399555\nQuestion ID: 1\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\nEvidence: Of the 2 patients with early virologic failure in the viremic group, 1 patient had a decrease in viral load less than 2 log ~10~ at the first maintenance injection (from 214 540 to 39 293 copies/mL). A nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutation (L100I) was present on genotypic testing at this time, and injections were discontinued. The patient had not chosen to initiate oral ART as of database closure, and additional genotypic testing showed a new Y181I mutation in the RT gene. Risk factors for failure were a V179V/I mutation in the RT gene at baseline and rifabutin use 2 weeks before initiation of LA CAB--RPV. The second patient with failure was also noted to have a decrease in viral load of less than 2 log ~10~ at the first maintenance injection (from 137 134 to 4371 copies/mL) and, although the HIV viral load at the third injection was less than 30 copies/mL, genotypic testing was successful and showed an E138K mutation in the RT gene and an R263K mutation in the integrase gene. The baseline genotype resistance test had a minor integrase strand transferase inhibitor (INSTI) mutation (T97A).\nRationale: The genotypic testing described in the passage involved sequencing specific regions of the HIV genome from two patients who experienced early virologic failure.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 20530226\nQuestion ID: 13\nQuestion: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\nEvidence: Study population. The patients included in this study were screened for the Maraviroc Expanded Access Program (MVC EAP) in France between January, 2007 and August 2008 and received MVC associated with an optimized background therapy if the result of the phenotypic assay for coreceptor use determination was CCR5, using a previously validated assay (Trofile; Monogram Biosciences) (18). For the last group of patients included, a modified version with an optimized sensitivity of the assay was performed (16). All screened patients were included in the genotype-phenotype comparison, whereas only patients treated with MVC were included in the study correlating VR to the genotypic results.\nInclusion criteria for the MVC EAP were HIV-1 infection, ≥18 years of age, previous antiretroviral therapy, and virological failure with a plasma HIV-1 RNA load of >1,000 copies/ml. The patients were included in the GenoTropism Study in 18 participating centers in France. Sociodemographic data, clinical data, and treatment histories were collected for all enrolled patients at the screening date. MVC-treated patients were followed up at baseline (month 0 [M0]) and at months 1, 3, and 6 (M1, M3, and M6, respectively) on MVC-containing regimens. The patients had signed the MVC EAP informed consent form and were specifically informed about their participation in the GenoTropism Study. The study was approved by the Comité Consultatif de Traitement de l'Information dans la Recherche Scientifique et Médicale and the Commission Nationale Informatique et Libertés.\nRationale: The patients were part of the Maraviroc Expanded Access Program (MVC EAP) and the GenoTropism Study, which involved clinical follow-up and data collection, but  the study didn't mention this is a clinical trial\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 37167996\nQuestion ID: 5\nQuestion: How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?\nEvidence: Of the 42 women experiencing virologic failure, 35 (83%) had a genotype result from a sample taken at the time of failure. While 19 (54%) of these women had at least one HIV drug resistance mutation at virologic failure, most of these mutations were also detected in their enrollment samples. At study entry, drug resistance mutations were detected in 15 (36%) of 42 women with virologic failure, including 10 women in the efavirenz/emitricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group, and 5 women in the dolutegravir-containing groups.\nRationale: The paper mentions that 42 women experienced virological failure and had genotypic resistance testing performed. 42 at study entry and 35 at the time of failure.\nAnswer: 42"}

We evaluated the need for a\nlead-in supplementary dolutegravir dose in adults failing first-line\ntenofovir-emtricitabine-efavirenz (TEE).\n\n### Methods\n\nWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2\ntrial in Khayelitsha, South Africa. Eligible patients had virologic\nfailure (2 consecutive HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL) on first-line TEE.\nParticipants were randomly assigned (1:1) to switch to\ntenofovir-lamivudine-dolutegravir (TLD) with a supplementary 50 mg\ndolutegravir dose or placebo taken 12 hours later for 14 days. Primary\noutcome was proportion with HIV-1 RNA \\<50 copies/mL at week 24. This\nstudy was not powered to compare arms.\n\n### Results\n\nOne hundred thirty participants were randomized (65 to each arm). Median\nbaseline HIV-1 RNA was 4.0 log ~10~ copies/mL and 76% had baseline\nresistance to both tenofovir and lamivudine. One participant died and 2\nwere lost to follow-up. At week 24, 55 of 64 (86% \\[95% confidence\ninterval {CI}: 75%--93%\\]) in the supplementary dolutegravir arm and 53\nof 65 (82% \\[95% CI: 70%--90%\\]) in the placebo arm had HIV-1 RNA \\<50\ncopies/mL. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were similar in frequency between\narms. None of 6 participants (3 in each arm) eligible for resistance\ntesting by 24 weeks developed dolutegravir resistance.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nOur findings do not support the need for initial dolutegravir dose\nadjustment in patients switching to TLD who failed first-line TEE.\n\n### Clinical Trials Registration\n\nNCT03991013 .\n\n**Keywords:** antiretroviral therapy, HIV, dolutegravir, efavirenz,\nsecond-line\n\n\n\n## METHODS\n\n### Study Design and Participants\n\nARTIST is a noncomparative, randomized, double-blind,\nplacebo-controlled, phase 2, 48-week trial of second-line TLD with or\nwithout a lead-in supplementary dolutegravir dose in patients with\nvirologic failure on first-line TEE. A detailed protocol describing our\nmethods has been published \\[ 12 \\]. We recruited patients from 3\nprimary care clinics in Khayelitsha, a large, periurban settlement in\nCape Town, South Africa.\n\nEligible patients were adults (≥18 years old) with virologic failure\n(defined as 2 consecutive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)\nRNA ≥1000 copies/mL 2--24 months apart) on a first-line regimen of\ntenofovir, emtricitabine (or lamivudine), and efavirenz. Exclusion\ncriteria were CD4 ^+^ cell count \\<100 cells/µL; estimated glomerular\nfiltration rate \\<50 mL/minute/1.73 m ^2^ ; alanine aminotransferase\n\\>100 IU/L; total bilirubin more than twice the upper limit of normal;\nactive opportunistic infection; active malignancy; pregnant or intention\nto become pregnant; breastfeeding; active psychiatric condition or\nsubstance abuse judged likely to impact adherence; and allergy or\nintolerance to one of the study drugs. Women of childbearing potential\nwere required to receive effective contraception. On 14 July 2021, the\nstudy protocol was amended to include patients with CD4 ^+^ cell counts\nof between 50 and 100 cells/µL to facilitate recruitment.\n\n### Randomization, Allocation Concealment, and Masking\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned (1:1) to a second-line regimen\nconsisting of tenofovir (300 mg), lamivudine (300 mg), and dolutegravir\n(50 mg), given as a once-daily fixed-dose combination tablet, with an\nadditional lead-in dose of dolutegravir (50 mg) or placebo taken 12\nhours later for the first 14 days. An independent pharmacist generated\nthe randomization sequence before trial commencement using block\nrandomization (block size of 10). The study pharmacists used\nsequentially drawn individually sealed opaque envelopes to assign a\ntreatment arm when dispensing medication. All participants and study\nstaff involved in clinical care were blinded to treatment allocation.\n\n### Procedures\n\nFollow-up study visits with clinicians occurred at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12,\n16, 20, and 24 (with a visit window of ±16 days at each visit except the\nweek 24 visit, which had a window of ±6 weeks). Plasma HIV-1 RNA was\nmeasured at baseline and every visit from week 4 onward. If any HIV-1\nRNA after week 12 was ≥50 copies/mL, or if there was \\<1 log ~10~\ndecline in HIV-1 RNA from baseline, or if HIV-1 RNA was suppressed and\nsubsequently rebound to ≥50 copies/mL, enhanced adherence counseling was\nperformed, and HIV-1 RNA measurement was repeated after 2 weeks. If the\nrepeat HIV-1 RNA was ≥500 copies/mL, a genotypic antiretroviral\nresistance test (GART) was performed. Baseline GART was performed\nretrospectively for all participants after completion of week 24 visits,\non plasma samples stored at enrollment (with results not returned to\nclinicians). GART was performed at the National Health Laboratory\nService Virology Laboratory at Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town, South\nAfrica, and drug susceptibility prediction was performed with the\nStanford algorithm (version 9.1) \\[ 13 \\].\n\nCD4 ^+^ cell count was done at baseline and 24 weeks. We screened for\ninsomnia using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) at baseline and every\nvisit \\[ 14 \\]. At baseline, 2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks, we screened for\npsychiatric symptoms using the Brief Symptoms Inventory Anxiety Subscale\n\\[ 15 \\] and the Centre for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale \\[ 16\n\\], and for neurocognitive impairment using the Simioni symptom\nquestionnaire \\[ 17 \\] and the cognitive assessment tool--rapid version\n\\[ 18 \\].\n\nWe monitored adherence with tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP)\nconcentrations at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks, using stored dried\nblood spot specimens. An indirect method for the quantification of\nTFV-DP in 50 mL human dried blood spots was adapted from a previously\ndescribed method \\[ 19 \\] and validated at the Division of Clinical\nPharmacology at the University of Cape Town.\n\n### Outcomes\n\nThe primary outcome was proportion with virologic suppression (defined\nas HIV-1 RNA \\<50 copies/mL) at week 24. We conducted a modified\nintention-to-treat (mITT) analysis according to the US Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) snapshot approach, which defines failure as any 1\nof HIV-1 RNA measurements ≥50 copies/mL, missing HIV-1 RNA within the\nwindow, intolerance or adverse event because of any study drug requiring\nswitch, or loss to follow-up \\[ 20 \\]. All participants who received at\nleast 1 dose of the study drug were part of the analyzed cohort. Death\nfrom non-HIV and nondrug causes (as assessed by the study investigator)\nwas not regarded as failure and the participant was excluded from the\nmITT population.\n\nThe secondary outcomes included virologic suppression at week 12 (with\nthe same definition as for the primary outcome), proportion with HIV-1\nRNA \\<400 copies/mL at weeks 12 and 24 (mITT; FDA Snapshot), time to\nvirologic suppression, emergence of resistance mutations in participants\nmeeting protocol-defined criteria for GART, including those with\nvirologic failure (defined as 2 consecutive HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL\nafter week 12), and proportion developing grade 3 or 4 adverse events\nand serious adverse events. Adverse events were evaluated and graded at\nall study visits according to the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the\nSeverity of Adult and Paediatric Adverse Events \\[ 21 \\].\n\n### Statistical Considerations\n\nA sample size of 57 participants in each arm was estimated to produce a\n95% confidence interval (CI) of 72%--92%, assuming the proportion\nachieving virologic suppression of 82% at week 24 (as achieved in the\ndolutegravir arm of the DAWNING study \\[ 2 \\]). We increased the sample\nsize to 65 in each arm to account for loss to follow-up. We calculated\nthe proportion with virologic suppression with 95% CI for each arm.\nTime-to-event outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan--Meier survival\nanalysis. Prespecified sensitivity analyses of virologic suppression at\nweeks 12 and 24 were performed excluding individuals with evidence of\npoor adherence (TFV-DP concentration \\<350 fmol/punch); missing HIV-1\nRNA within the window; loss to follow-up; and switching of study drug\nfor reasons other than treatment failure. The study was not powered to\ndemonstrate a statistical difference between the arms, and therefore, no\nformal efficacy comparison was conducted.\n\n### Ethics Approval\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all participants. This study\nwas approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at the University of\nCape Town (Ref 039/2019). We registered the study protocol on\nClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT03991013 ). A trial steering committee with\nindependent members provided trial oversight and an independent data and\nsafety committee reviewed interim safety data every 2 months.\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\nParticipants were recruited between 28 August 2020 and 10 November 2021.\nOf 178 adults screened, 130 participants were randomly assigned to\nreceive lead-in supplementary dolutegravir (n = 65) or placebo (n = 65)\n( Figure 1 ). One participant died from severe coronavirus disease 2019,\nwhich was not considered drug-related or HIV-related, and therefore, 129\nwere included in the mITT analysis. Two participants were lost to\nfollow-up before week 24. Baseline characteristics were well balanced\nbetween the randomized arms ( Table 1 ). The majority (76%) of the 120\nparticipants with successful baseline GART had mutations associated with\nat least low-level resistance to both tenofovir and lamivudine ( Table 1\n).\n\nFigure 1.\n\nEligibility assessment, randomization, treatment, and follow-up. \\*Eight\npatients had CD4 count \\<100 cells/µL and 3 had CD4 count \\<50 cells/µL.\nThe protocol was amended to broaden the CD4 inclusion criterion from\n≥100 to ≥50 cells/µL on 14 July 2021. ^\\#^ Other reasons for exclusion\naccounted for \\<2% of patients screened (2 had positive pregnancy test,\n1 had alanine aminotransferase \\>100 IU/L, 1 had active Kaposi sarcoma,\n1 had a decrease of \\>2 log ~10~ copies/mL between 2 most recent human\nimmunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA measurements, and 1 had\nsignificant cognitive impairment likely to impact adherence). †One\nparticipant met protocol-defined criteria for loss to follow-up but\nreturned to the study at week 24 and had an HIV-1 RNA level ≥1000\ncopies/mL at week 24. Abbreviations: DTG, dolutegravir; ITT,\nintention-to-treat; TLD, tenofovir-lamivudine-dolutegravir.\n\nResistance was classified with the Stanford algorithm, with a score of\n≥15 indicating at least low-level resistance.\n\nDenominators indicate the numbers of participants with available viral\nsequences.\n\nBoth NRTIs had a Stanford score \\<15 indicating susceptibility or only\npotential of low-level resistance.\n\nVirologic outcomes by study arm at weeks 12 and 24 are shown in Table 2\n. At week 24, 55 (86% \\[95% CI: 75%--93%\\]) of 64 participants in the\nsupplementary dolutegravir arm achieved virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA\n\\<50 copies/mL) compared with 53 (82% \\[95% CI: 70%--90%\\]) of 65\nparticipants in the placebo arm. Virologic outcomes at 24 weeks for the\nparticipants with FDA Snapshot failure were: in the supplementary\ndolutegravir arm 6 had HIV-1 RNA 50--99 copies/mL and 3 had HIV-1 RNA\n100--999 copies/mL; in the placebo arm 4 had HIV-1 RNA 50--99 copies/mL,\n2 had HIV-1 RNA 100--999 copies/mL, 4 had HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL, 1\ndid not have an HIV-1 RNA test performed within the window, and 1\nswitched study drug following a tenofovir-related adverse event. Results\nof the sensitivity analyses were consistent with those of the mITT\nanalyses ( Table 2 ).\n\n\nmITT analysis excludes those switching study drug for reasons of\nstopping contraception or desire to become pregnant, becoming pregnant,\ntransfer out for nonclinical reasons, and death from non-HIV and nondrug\ncauses.\n\nSensitivity analysis excludes those excluded from mITT analysis, as well\nas loss to follow-up, missing viral load within the window, switching\nstudy drug for reasons other than treatment failure, and evidence of\npoor adherence (tenofovir diphosphate \\<350 fmol/punch).\n\nOne-sided 97.5% CI when 0 or 100% were successful.\n\nIn the subgroup with resistance to both tenofovir and lamivudine at\nbaseline, virologic suppression at week 24 was achieved by 39 of 45 (87%\n\\[95% CI: 73%--95%\\]) participants in the supplementary dolutegravir arm\nand 36 of 45 (80% \\[95% CI: 65%--90%\\]) participants in the placebo arm.\nTime to virologic suppression by arm is shown in Figure 2 . Median time\nto virologic suppression was 4.0 weeks (interquartile range \\[IQR\\],\n4.0--5.1 weeks) in the supplementary dolutegravir arm and 4.0 weeks\n(IQR, 4.0--6.1 weeks) in the placebo arm.\n\nFigure 2.\n\nKaplan-Meier for time to virological suppression (human immunodeficiency\nvirus type 1 RNA \\<50 copies/mL). Abbreviations: DTG, dolutegravir;\nHIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; TLD,\ntenofovir-lamivudine-dolutegravir.\n\nSix participants (3 in each arm) met protocol-defined criteria for GART\nby week 24; no participants developed dolutegravir resistance or\nacquired new resistance mutations to tenofovir or lamivudine. One\nparticipant in the supplementary dolutegravir arm developed virologic\nfailure at week 16; GART detected no integrase resistance mutations and\nthe participant reported poor adherence (corroborated by TFV-DP\nconcentration \\<350 fmol/punch at week 12). There were 19 participants\nwith HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL at week 24; 15 of 19 (79%) later\nresuppressed HIV-1 RNA \\<50 copies/mL with enhanced adherence\ncounseling.\n\nMedian increase in CD4 ^+^ cell count at week 24 was 88 cells/µL (IQR,\n45--138 cells/µL) in the supplementary dolutegravir arm and 75 cells/µL\n(IQR, 18--127 cells/µL) in the placebo arm. Median increase in weight\nwas 1.9 kg (IQR, −0.9 to 4.8 kg) over 24 weeks, to 78.1 kg in the\nsupplementary dolutegravir arm, versus 1.4 kg (IQR, −1.7 to 4.9 kg) to\n82.0 kg in the placebo arm. Median TFV-DP concentrations were similar\nbetween arms at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks ( Figure 3 ). Complete\nadherence to the additional dose of dolutegravir/placebo (assessed as no\nmissed dose by returned pill counts) was 77% in the supplementary\ndolutegravir arm and 70% in the placebo arm.\n\nFigure 3.\n\nTenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentrations at baseline, 12 weeks, and\n24 weeks (boxes indicate interquartile range, horizontal solid lines are\nmedians, vertical lines are ranges, and solid circles are outliers).\nDotted lines refer to TFV-DP concentrations categorized using the\nthreshold defined by Anderson et al \\[ 22 \\] as \\<350 fmol/punch (men:\n\\<1.2 doses per week and women: \\<0.6 doses per week), 350--700\nfmol/punch (men: 1.2--3.2 doses per week and women: 0.6--2.0 doses per\nweek), 700--1250 fmol/punch (men: 3.2--6 doses per week and women:\n2.0--5.3 doses per week), and \\>1250 fmol/punch (men: \\>6 doses per week\nand women: \\>5.3 doses per week). Abbreviations: DTG, dolutegravir;\nTFV-DP, tenofovir diphosphate; TLD, tenofovir-lamivudine-dolutegravir.\n\nGrade 3 or 4 adverse events and serious adverse events were uncommon (\nTable 3 ). At 2 weeks, 8 (12%) participants in the supplementary\ndolutegravir arm and 9 (14%) participants in the placebo arm reported\ninsomnia as an adverse event and had a ≥1 ISI score change from\nbaseline, with rapid attenuation of symptoms and ISI scores over time (\nFigure 4 ). Two (3%) participants in the supplementary dolutegravir arm\nand 8 (13%) participants in the placebo arm had ISI scores above\ndiagnostic threshold for clinically significant insomnia (ISI scores ≥8)\n\\[ 14 \\] over 24 weeks; none resulted in the discontinuation of therapy.\nEmergence of anxiety, depression, and cognitive complaints were low\nacross the arms. One grade 3 psychiatric adverse event (psychosis)\noccurred in the supplementary dolutegravir arm, which was not considered\ntreatment related. One participant developed tuberculosis at week 8;\ndolutegravir dose was increased to 50 mg twice daily until 2 weeks after\ncompleting rifampicin.\n\nFigure 4.\n\nProportion of participants with a ≥1-unit increase in the Insomnia\nSeverity Index (ISI) and reported insomnia as an adverse event. Sleep\nwas evaluated using the ISI, a 7-item tool with a total score ranging\nfrom 0 to 28. A higher score indicates a worse performance. Numerator is\nthe number of individuals who reported insomnia with at least a 1-unit\nincrease in ISI score from baseline (week 0). Denominator is the number\nof individuals with an ISI score at each week for all individuals with a\nbaseline result. Abbreviations: DTG, dolutegravir; TLD,\ntenofovir-lamivudine-dolutegravir.\n\n\nThe death in the DTG arm was caused by severe coronavirus disease 2019\n(COVID-19).\n\nThe SAEs in the DTG arm were severe COVID-19 leading to death, and acute\npsychosis, which was considered unrelated to the study drug and resolved\nwithout discontinuation of the study drug.\n\nThe grade 3 AEs in the DTG arm were acute psychosis and incident\npulmonary tuberculosis. The grade 3 AEs in the placebo arm were raised\nrandom glucose (experienced by 2 participants), acute kidney injury\n(experienced by 2 participants), and headache.\n\nOne participant in the placebo arm switched from tenofovir to zidovudine\nafter developing a creatinine elevation.\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nIn our study, second-line TLD produced acceptable rates of virologic\nsuppression at 24 weeks in adults with virologic failure on first-line\nTEE, with and without a lead-in supplementary dolutegravir dose. No\nemergent dolutegravir resistance occurred over 24 weeks among our cohort\nof patients who switched with unsuppressed HIV-1 RNA levels, despite the\nmajority having resistance to both tenofovir and lamivudine at baseline.\nOur findings strengthen the evidence base for recycling tenofovir and\nlamivudine with dolutegravir in second-line ART in resource-limited\nsettings.\n\nOur results are consistent with those from previous randomized\ncontrolled trials assessing the efficacy of dolutegravir in second-line\nART \\[ 2 , 5 , 23 \\]. In the NADIA study, 92% of participants who\nmaintained tenofovir in second-line regimens achieved HIV-1 RNA \\<400\ncopies/mL at week 48 \\[ 24 \\]. At week 96, recycling tenofovir was\nsuperior to switching to zidovudine in NADIA \\[ 5 \\]. In the VISEND\nstudy, 83% of participants randomized to TLD with preswitch HIV-1 RNA\n\\>1000 copies/mL achieved HIV-1 RNA \\<1000 copies/mL at week 48 \\[ 23\n\\]. Most of our participants (76%) had resistance to both NRTIs at\nbaseline and the proportion achieving virologic suppression in this\nsubgroup was similar to that achieved by the same subgroup in NADIA \\[\n24 \\]. It is well established that the modest effect of NRTIs on\nreducing viral fitness in the presence of NRTI resistance mutations is\nboth necessary and sufficient to achieve virologic suppression in\ncombination with a protease inhibitor \\[ 25 \\]; this appears to also be\ntrue with dolutegravir. The proportion of patients who had virologic\nsuppression while taking a dolutegravir-based second-line regimen was\nsimilar to that among patients taking a well-tolerated protease\ninhibitor--based second-line regimen \\[ 5 , 23 \\].\n\nA previous study conducted among healthy, HIV-negative volunteers showed\nthat efavirenz reduced dolutegravir trough concentrations by 75% when\ncoadministered, but that doubling the dolutegravir dose mitigated the\ndrug--drug interaction \\[ 8 \\]. In a company-sponsored study,\ndolutegravir and efavirenz concentrations did not simultaneously fall\nbelow their respective clinical target concentrations after switching\nfrom efavirenz to dolutegravir \\[ 26 \\]. Based on that study,\ndolutegravir dose adjustment is not recommended for patients who switch\nwith suppressed HIV-1 RNA levels. However, there has been concern that\namong patients with efavirenz and NRTI resistance who switch with\nunsuppressed HIV-1 RNA levels, dolutegravir resistance may be selected\nin some individuals. Our results suggest that initial dolutegravir dose\nadjustment is not required when switching from efavirenz to dolutegravir\namong viremic individuals, and therefore, the pill burden and cost of an\nadditional (non-fixed-dose combination) dose of dolutegravir when\ntransitioning to second-line can be avoided.\n\nEmergent dolutegravir resistance has been documented infrequently in\nsecond-line ART (4% at 96 weeks in NADIA, and 2% at 159 weeks in\nDAWNING) \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. In a prospective cohort study of 1892 Malawian\npatients who were transitioned from NNRTI-based first-line to TLD\nwithout preswitch HIV-1 RNA testing, 2 cases of dolutegravir resistance\nwere detected at 6 months; both patients were viremic at switch and\nreceived dolutegravir with no predicted active NRTIs \\[ 7 \\].\nIntermittent adherence, drug--drug interactions, high baseline HIV-1 RNA\nlevels, and active opportunistic infections are risk factors associated\nwith emergent dolutegravir resistance \\[ 27 \\]. The lack of dolutegravir\nresistance in our cohort over 24 weeks may be attributed to optimal\nadherence in the majority supported with intensive adherence counseling,\nthe exclusion of patients with active AIDS-defining conditions and\ncontraindicated drug--drug interactions, and the relatively low median\nHIV-1 RNA levels at study entry. Further research into the risks\nassociated with and mechanisms underlying integrase mutation selection\nis needed to better predict the development of dolutegravir resistance\nand determine the clinical consequence of dolutegravir resistance,\nparticularly when combined with preexisting NRTI resistance.\n\nIn ARTIST, we observed a substantial incidence of insomnia (13%)\nreported by participants at week 2 with no discernible difference in the\nproportion between arms; the majority of insomnia complaints were mild\nand did not reach clinical significance based on ISI scores, and 76%\nresolved by week 4. The incidence of insomnia we found is twice that\nreported in a meta-analysis of trial participants randomized to\ndolutegravir \\[ 28 \\]. However, previous studies have not evaluated\ninsomnia in the first 2 weeks after initiating dolutegravir, and early\nevents that resolved by 4 weeks may have been missed. Our findings\nhighlight the need for further research to assess neuropsychiatric\nadverse events in larger patient populations that should be part of\npharmacovigilance initiatives with the current transition to\ndolutegravir-based regimens.\n\nOur study has limitations. First, our study was not powered to formally\nassess differences between arms. Although the sample size did not allow\nfor a statistically powered comparison, our study was designed to\nrapidly generate data to supplement the findings from NADIA \\[ 5 \\] and\nthe ongoing D²EFT study (estimated date of completion in July 2023) \\[\n29 \\] to inform clinical care for patients transitioning to\ndolutegravir-based regimens in resource-limited settings. Second, our\nprimary virologic outcome was at 24 weeks; the development of\ndolutegravir resistance is often delayed \\[ 5 , 6 \\]. Dolutegravir\nresistance may be detected with longer-term follow-up. Third, all our\nparticipants received frequent HIV-1 RNA monitoring and intensive\nadherence counseling, and we excluded patients with active AIDS-defining\nconditions. The results may not be generalizable to patients receiving\ntreatment under programmatic conditions where HIV-1 RNA monitoring is\ninfrequent.\n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe ARTIST study provides additional evidence that maintaining tenofovir\nand lamivudine with dolutegravir is effective and well tolerated in\nsecond-line ART. Our results provide evidence over 24 weeks that\npatients with unsuppressed HIV-1 RNA levels on first-line TEE can safely\nswitch to second-line TLD without a lead-in supplementary dolutegravir\ndose to overcome efavirenz induction---however, it is possible that\nresistance will emerge at later timepoints.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n***Financial support* .** This work was supported by an investigator\naward from the Wellcome Trust (212265/Z/18/Z) and the Médecins Sans\nFrontières Khayelitsha Project.

ART had to be started on the first medical\nappointment, before any laboratory results were available. Participants\ncompleted a self-administered questionnaire at each visit including a\nHIV anxiety 5-point Likert scale. The primary outcome was the proportion\nof participants in the ITT population with plasma HIV RNA (pVL) \\< 50\ncopies/mL at Week (W) 24 using the FDA Snapshot algorithm.\n\nResults\n\nOverall, 112 participants were included in the ITT population. During\nfollow-up, seven participants discontinued the study drug but remained\non the study, and seven others discontinued follow-up. According to FDA\nSnapshot analysis, at W24 and W48, 90/112, (80.4%; 95% CI: 71.8--87.3)\nand 95/112 (84.8%; 95% CI: 76.8--90.9) of participants achieved\npVL \\< 50 copies/mL, respectively. The protocol-defined virological\nfailure (PDVF, 2 consecutive pVL ≥ 50 copies/mL as of W24) was observed\nin 11/112 (9.8%) at W24 and 14/112 (12.5%) at W48. No emergent\nresistance-associated mutation was detected in those with PDVF at W24\nand W48. BIC/FTC/TAF was well tolerated through to W48, with a low\nincidence of grade 3--4 adverse events (15/100 person-years). Patient\nopinion of same-day treatment initiation and continuing BIC/FTC/TAF was\nvery favourable.\n\nConclusions\n\nThese results suggest that BIC/FTC/TAF is safe, effective and well\naccepted for same-day initiation.\n\n\n## Patients and methods\n\n### Study design and population\n\nThe FAST study was a national, multicentre, prospective, open-label\nsingle-arm study assessing the feasibility, efficacy and safety of\nBIC/FTC/TAF in a same-day initiation model. ART had to be started on the\nfirst medical appointment, before any laboratory result was available.\n\nEligible participants were ART-naive adults (aged ≥18 years) with newly\ndiagnosed HIV infection evidenced by any of the following tests: (i)\npositive self-test, (ii) positive HIV rapid antibody test, (iii)\npositive HIV immunoassay (ELISA fourth-generation) test. The tests could\nbe performed in a sexual health clinic, in a private laboratory facility\nor by the individual themself. Participants were then referred to HIV\nconsultations at different study sites. Participants had to have regular\nhealth insurance and to provide two forms of contact information\n(telephone number and e-mail) in order to be easily reached if needed\nbetween Day 0 and Day 7. In addition, women of childbearing potential\nhad to have a negative urine pregnancy test and be willing to use\neffective contraception (barrier or hormonal).\n\nThe current study was approved by the Ethics Committee (Sud Méditerranée\nV; No. CNRIPH:19.02.11.50511) and by the French National Agency for\nMedicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM) and was registered in\nClinicaltrials.gov (NCT03858478). All study participants provided\nwritten informed consent, obtained before study initiation.\n\n### Procedures\n\nParticipants were screened and enrolled at the first medical visit\n(baseline) and started BIC/FTC/TAF once daily before availability of\nbaseline laboratory results. At the baseline visit, samples were\ncollected for routine testing, confirmation of HIV serology and HIV\nresistance genotyping. Baseline laboratory results and baseline genotype\nfor HIV-1 drug resistance mutations were available at Week (W) 1 and by\nW4, respectively.\n\nAll patients included received the study treatment before any\nconfirmation results and were kept informed within a short time (maximum\n7 days). Participants with false-positive HIV tests at diagnosis stopped\ntheir current treatment. In addition, in the case of baseline mutations\nassociated with resistance to BIC, FTC or TAF (according to November\n2019 French HIV-resistance algorithm---version 30---ANRS---AC 43:\nRESISTANCE GROUP), ^\\ \\ 7^ a modification of study treatment was\nproposed according to National French Guidelines, ^\\ \\ 8^ and left to\nthe discretion of the investigator.\n\nAfter the baseline visit, participants were seen at W2, W4 and W12, and\nthen every 12 weeks until W48. At each visit, participants had routine\nsafety monitoring as well as measurement of CD4 and CD8 cell counts and\npVL. Plasma HIV-1-RNA was quantified using the COBAS 6800 ^®^ HIV-1 Test\nkit (Roche, Bale, Switzerland) with a lower limit of quantification\n(LOQ) of 20 copies/mL.\n\nVirological non-response was defined as a pVL ≥ 400 copies/mL at the W12\nvisit, confirmed on a second sample taken 2--3 weeks later, or as a\npVL ≥ 50 copies/mL at the W24 visit or thereafter, confirmed on a second\nsample taken 2--3 weeks later. In such cases, National French Guidelines\nalso recommended performance of a resistance genotypic test and\ndetermination of BIC, FTC and tenofovir (TFV) plasma concentrations. In\nthe case of detection of resistance mutations to study drugs, a\nmodification of study treatment was proposed according to National\nFrench Guidelines, ^\\ \\ 8^ and left to the discretion of the\ninvestigator.\n\nParticipants could also have their treatment modified for other reasons\nsuch as pregnancy or safety but remained on the study.\n\nBlood samples for drug concentrations analysis were collected during the\nstudy period at W4, W12, W24 and W48, approximately 24 h after the last\ndrug intake ( *C* ~24h~ ). Plasma concentrations of BIC, FTC and TFV\nwere determined by a validated LC coupled with tandem MS (UPLC-MS/MS;\nWaters Acquity UPLC-TQD, Milford, MA, USA). ^\\ \\ 9^\n\nThe LOQ was 10 ng/mL for BIC and FTC and 5 ng/mL for TFV. Interpretation\nof BIC *C* ~24h~ results was based on the corresponding *in vitro*\nprotein-adjusted IC ~95~ for WT HIV-1: 162 ng/mL. ^\\ \\ 10^\n\nParticipants completed self-administered questionnaires at Day (D)0,\nW12, W24 and W48: HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire change\n(HIVTSQc) and an anxiety scale (STAI-Y), to evaluate acceptability,\nanxiety and general satisfaction of treatment.\n\n### Outcomes\n\nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of participants in the ITT\npopulation with pVL \\< 50 copies/mL at W24 using the US FDA Snapshot\nalgorithm. ^\\ \\ 11^\n\nSecondary endpoints were the proportion of false-positive HIV tests at\ndiagnosis in all enrolled participants, median time between diagnosis of\nHIV and initiation of ART, time to suppression from enrolment, change\nfrom baseline in CD4 cell count and CD4/CD8 cell count ratio at W48, the\nproportion of participants with modification of study treatment, the\nsafety of BIC/FTC/TAF, change in BMI, the proportion with virological\nnon-response, the proportion with treatment-emergent HIV\nresistance-associated mutations in those with virological non-response,\nadherence to the first-line regimen through self-questionnaire and\npharmacological analysis, the proportion who were lost to follow-up, and\nfeasibility and satisfaction with immediate ART initiation in the ITT\npopulation.\n\nSafety was assessed in the ITT population, including adverse events,\nserious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events leading to discontinuation\nof BIC/FTC/TAF, drug-related adverse events, and laboratory\nabnormalities. Adverse events were graded according to the ANRS scale\nfor rating the severity of adverse effects, version 6 (9 September\n2003).\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nThe estimated sample size of 110 participants was based on a power of at\nleast 86%, an exact binomial test with a one-tailed significance level\nof 5%, a difference between the null hypothesis, a proportion of\nvirological success of 80%, and the alternative proportion of 90% (the\nexpected success rate on BIC/FTC/TAF). ^\\ \\ 12^\n\nThe primary and all secondary endpoints were analysed on an ITT basis.\nThe ITT population consisted of all participants who received at least\none dose of BIC/FTC/TAF, excluding those who failed screening\n(false-positive serology, pretreated or already in medical care).\n\nThe percentages of participants with virological suppression (HIV RNA\n\\<50 copies/mL according to the FDA Snapshot analysis) and virological\nfailure at W24 and W48 were calculated by dividing the number of events\nby the total number of participants. Associated 95% CIs were calculated\nwith the exact Clopper--Pearson method. Primary efficacy analyses were\nrepeated for the per-protocol population, which excluded from the ITT\npopulation participants with serious protocol violations that could\ninterfere with the reliability of efficacy results (e.g. those who were\nlost to follow-up, withdrew consent, or prematurely terminated the study\nfor reasons unrelated to efficacy or safety). The median time to\nvirological suppression was estimated using the Kaplan--Meier estimates.\n\nThe changes in biological parameters from baseline to W48 were assessed\nusing the non-parametric Wilcoxon paired test. Missing data were filled\nin using the 'last observation carried forward' method. The cumulative\nincidence of adverse events, grade 3 and 4 adverse events, drug-related\nadverse events (all grades), treatment interruptions due to adverse\nevents (all grades) and deaths was estimated by the number of incident\ncases divided by the total number of person-years. The associated 95% CI\nwas calculated by assuming a Poisson distribution of the number of\nincident cases.\n\nScores of anxiety, acceptability and general satisfaction with HIV\ntreatment assessed using a self-reported questionnaire were compared\nover time using a one-way ANOVA for repeated data.\n\nAdherence rate, estimated as the number of pills consumed (recorded\nusing the self-reported questionnaire) divided by the number of pills\nthat should have been consumed, was classified as low (\\<80%), medium\n(80%--95%) or high (\\>95%).\n\nBaseline data were described overall for all included participants and\nby group (included versus excluded). Data were summarized using median\nand IQR for continuous variables and number and percentage for\ncategorical values. The non-parametric Mann--Whitney test was used to\ncompare continuous variables between groups and the Fisher exact test or\nchi-squared test for categorical variables. All *P* values are reported\nfor two-tailed tests with a significance threshold of 0.05. Analyses\nwere conducted with SAS ^®^ version 9.4.\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Study participants\n\nOf 131 participants screened, 13 refused to participate (chose to\nparticipate in another clinical protocol: *n* = 4; needed time: *n* = 4;\nwere not sufficiently available for study visits: *n* = 3; unknown\nreason: *n* = 2). One hundred and eighteen participants were enrolled\nacross 15 sites in France between November 2019 and September 2020. Six\nhad protocol violation: three false-positive HIV tests \\[one self-test\nand two HIV immunoassay (ELISA 4th generation) tests\\], one already in\nmedical care, two pretreated). Thus, 112 were included in the ITT-FDA\nSnapshot analysis (see flow chart, Figure 1 ).\n\nFigure 1.\n\nFlow chart.

Median\n(IQR) time between diagnosis of HIV and initiation of ART was 8 (5--17)\ndays. Of the 23 who were included at the time of primary HIV infection\n(PHI), 21 were included in the ITT analysis (Fiebig stage: 1 I; 2 II; 2\nIII; 13 IV; 13 V). ^\\ \\ 13^ The remaining two had protocol violation\n(one already in medical care, one already on treatment).\n\n\nSeven participants discontinued the study treatment before W48 but\nremained on the study (one for pre-existing M184V resistance mutation,\ntwo for E157Q polymorphism in the integrase gene conferring possible\nresistance to BIC according to the 2019 French HIV-resistance algorithm,\n^\\ \\ 7^ three for intolerance, one for PDVF). In addition, four\nparticipants withdrew from the study at W10, W19, W23 and W37 (two moved\naway, one death, one in detention) and three were lost to follow-up at\nW4, W5 and W12.\n\n### Efficacy\n\nAt W24, according to the ITT-FDA Snapshot analysis (Figure 2 ), 90/112\n(80.4%) participants achieved pVL \\< 50 copies/mL (95% CI: 71.8--87.3).\nMedian (IQR) time to suppression was 4 weeks (95% CI: 4--12).

Of the 21 included in the FDA Snapshot at the time of\nPHI, 19/21 (90.5%) achieved pVL \\< 50 copies/mL (95% CI: 69.6--98.8).\n\nProtocol-defined virological failure (PDVF, two consecutive pVL ≥ 50\ncopies/mL as of W24) was observed in 11/112 (9.8%) at W24 and 14/112\n(12.5%) at W48. No emergent resistance-associated mutations were\ndetected in those with PDVF at W24 and W48. At the time of virological\nfailure, median pVL was 89 copies/mL, with a range of pVL between 55 and\n339 copies/mL, and during the follow-up period all BIC *C* ~24h~\nexceeded 4-fold the *in vitro* protein-adjusted IC ~95~ (4 × 162 = 648\nng/mL) in these 12 participants. These results suggest that there was no\nlack of adherence to study treatment. All participants experiencing PDVF\nhad high baseline viral loads between 247 713 and 10 000 000 copies/mL\nwith a median viral load of 880 000 copies/mL.\n\nMedian change from baseline to W48 in CD4 cell count and CD4/CD8 cell\ncount ratio on study treatment was +230 cells/mL (IQR 118--360) and\n+0.32 (IQR 0.17--0.6), respectively.\n\n### Safety\n\nWe observed a low incidence of grade 3--4 adverse events (15/100\nperson-years) and SAEs, including one death due to suicide (1/100\nperson-years). None of them was deemed related to study treatment by the\nlocal investigator (suicidal death, *n* = 1; haematological abnormality,\n*n* = 1; hepatobiliary abnormality, *n* = 3; neuropsychiatric disorder,\n*n* = 2; other infectious diseases, *n* = 4).\n\nThree grade 1 adverse events led to discontinuation of BIC/FTC/TAF, one\nbefore W24 (dizziness at W14 that resolved after discontinuing study\ntreatment) and two additional events in two participants between W24 and\nW48 (modification of fat distribution at W27 and dry mouth at W40).\n\nAt W24, median (IQR) BMI change on treatment was +0.9 kg/m ^2^\n(0.3--1.8) for a median (IQR) percentage increase in BMI from baseline\nof +4.1% (1.2--7.8).\n\nAt W48, median (IQR) BMI change on treatment was +1.2 kg (0.3--2.1) for\na median (IQR) percentage increase in BMI from baseline of +5.1%\n(1.6--10.1).\n\n### Pharmacological analysis\n\nFor all periods together, median (IQR) *C* ~24h~ determined in 109\nparticipants during follow-up ( *n* = 379 measures) was 2300\n(1741--2819), 108 (70--250) and 9 ng/mL (7--12) for BIC, FTC and TFV,\nrespectively. Median between-patient variability of *C* ~24h~ during the\nstudy period (W4 to W48) was 38% for BIC, 79% for FTC and 51% for TFV.\n\nFor each period assessed individually, all BIC, FTC and TFV\nconcentrations were stable between W4, W12, W234 and W48 (Figure 4 ).\nMoreover, all patients (except three with all antiretroviral *C* ~24h~\n\\< LOQ: one at W4, one at W12 and one at W48) had BIC *C* ~24h~ above\nthe target of 162 ng/mL, the *in vitro* protein-adjusted IC ~95~ for WT\nHIV-1.\n\nFigure 4.\n\nMedian (IQR) of bictegravir (BIC) (a), emtricitabine (FTC) (b) and\ntenofovir (TFV) (c) plasma concentrations determined 24 h ( *C* ~24h~ )\nafter the last BIC/FTC/TAF (50/200/25 mg) once-daily oral administration\nat W4 ( *n* = 104 patients), W12 ( *n* = 90), W24 ( *n* = 93) and W48 (\n*n* = 92). This figure appears in colour in the online version of *JAC*\nand in black and white in the print version of *JAC* .\n\nOpen in new tab Download slide\n\n### Adherence\n\nSelf-reported adherence over the last 4 weeks (compliance with more than\n95% of treatment intake) was 84.5% and 83.7% at W24 and W48,\nrespectively.\n\n### Acceptability, anxiety and satisfaction\n\nAll participants ( *n* = 112) completed at least one self-administered\nquestionnaire out of the four planned by the protocol. Four hundred and\nthirteen observations were fully completed, out of the 448 expected\n(i.e. 92.2%), and therefore analysed.\n\nParticipants' opinion of same-day treatment initiation and continuing\nBIC/FTC/TAF was very favourable. Subjects felt that same-day initiation\nwas better and more effective, with an average score between 8 and 9\napproximately (for a maximum score of 10). Level of stress with regard\nto same-day initiation was good, with an average score of 6.3 (for a\nmaximum score of stress of 10).\n\nThe anxiety questionnaire showed a decrease in the level of anxiety over\ntime, going from an average score of 52 (range 20--80) at D0 to 40 at\nW12. The anxiety score continued to decrease, but more slowly, to 39 at\nW12 and to 37 at W48 and this decrease was still significant ( *P*\n\\< 0.001).\n\nGeneral/clinical satisfaction and lifestyle/comfort subscales, measured\nby HIVTSQc evaluated satisfaction over 5 (range 0--6) for each point.\nThe overall average score was high, between 25.9 and 26.8, and the\nincrease was significant, with a maximum possible score of 30.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nThese results demonstrated the efficacy, safety and feasibility of using\nBIC/FTC/TAF as a first-line regimen in a same-day initiation strategy.\nWhen using a test-and-treat approach, baseline genotypic and laboratory\ndata are not available before therapy initiation; therefore, transmitted\nresistance, kidney function and HBV coinfection are important\nconsiderations. Given renal safety data of BIC/FTC/TAF and its activity\nin HIV/HBV coinfected patients, BIC/FTC/TAF is an appealing option in a\nsame-day initiation strategy with low incidence of side effects.\n\nAs a measure of virological efficacy of a first-line ART, the proportion\nof individuals achieving pVL \\< 50 copies/mL at W48 is commonly used.\nHere we chose a stringent primary endpoint of pVL \\< 50 copies/mL at W24\nby ITT-E FDA Snapshot analysis. The ITT-E FDA Snapshot analysis\nevaluates the probability of a newly diagnosed individual with HIV-1\nimmediately initiating BIC/FTC/TAF, remaining in care, to be suppressed\n(pVL \\< 50 copies/mL) 24 weeks later while still on study treatment.\nAmong all participants, 80.4% (90/112) had pVL \\< 50 copies/mL at W24\n(ITT-E FDA Snapshot). In our study, three participants required ART\nmodifications for baseline lamivudine/emtricitabine resistance ( *n*\n= 1) or possible resistance to bictegravir ( *n* = 2). However,\npolymorphic mutation E157Q is now no longer considered as associated\nwith resistance to bictegravir in the updated French resistance\nalgorithm (October 2021, ANRS French HIV resistance algorithm---version\n32); ^\\ \\ 14^ therefore, the two participants with this baseline\nmutation would no longer have been advised to switch to another regimen\nand might have achieved virological suppression by W24 had they remained\non the study treatment. Of note, the three participants who switched\nfrom BIC/FTC/TAF due to baseline genotypic resistance achieved pVL \\< 50\ncopies/mL at W24, which was sustained until W48.\n\nA per-protocol analysis is also useful to assess the effectiveness of a\nsame-day BIC/FTC/TAF initiation approach that would allow modification\nof ART for underlying viral resistance. The per-protocol analysis, which\nincluded all 103 participants with available pVL data at W24,\ndemonstrated achievement of pVL \\< 50 copies/mL in 87.4% ( *n* = 90),\nirrespective of the regimen received.\n\nOf the six participants included in error and excluded from the ITT\nanalysis, three already knew their HIV status (one already in medical\ncare, two pretreated on ART) but claimed they were unaware of their HIV\ninfection on the first medical contact. One explanation might be that\nresidence permits are facilitated in France for migrants with diseases\nfor which it is difficult to obtain appropriate treatment in the country\nof origin. ^\\ \\ 15^ Consequently, if a patient arrives in France already\non ART, the regularization procedure would be complicated because this\ndoes mean that ART is available in their country of origin and under\nthese conditions, they may choose to conceal this information during the\nvisit to the hospital.\n\nThree (3.3%) participants were lost to follow-up, consistent with other\ntest-and-treat studies (STAT trial, 5%; DIAMOND, 3%).\n^\\ \\ 16\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 17^ A limitation of the FAST study is that it only\nevaluated BIC/FTC/TAF in a same-day initiation approach in France, and\nresults may not be generalizable to other geographical regions with\ngreater HIV burden, increased prevalence of transmitted resistance, and\nfewer healthcare resources.\n\nThirteen out of 21 (62%) participants with pVL \\> 500 000 copies/mL at\nbaseline were suppressed to less than 50 copies/mL at W24. The viral\nsuppression was achieved at W48 for 18 of them (85.7%). These results\nare consistent with those in participants with high baseline viral load\nfrom the STAT trial, which involved a dual first-line ART with\ndolutegravir plus lamivudine, and in which 19 of 131 (14.5%)\nparticipants had pVL \\> 500 000 copies/mL at baseline, with 13 (68%)\nsuppressed to pVL \\< 50 copies/mL by W24. ^\\ \\ 16^\n\nSeventeen of 21 (81%) participants included during PHI were suppressed\nto less than 50 copies/mL at W24. Viral suppression was achieved at W48\nfor 19 (90%). These results further underline the value of rapid\ntreatment with BIC/FTC/TAF in the management of patients with primary\nHIV infection.\n\nThese ITT results are better than those observed in participants with\nPHI in the DIAMOND trial, in which 13 of 109 (12%) participants had PHI\nat baseline, with 10 (77%) suppressed to pVL \\< 50 copies/mL by W48.\n^\\ \\ 17^ The difference between the two studies might be explained by\nthe shorter time between ART initiation and achievement of virological\nsuppression with integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)- versus\nboosted-PI-based regimens, and by the higher rates of virological\nsuppression reported in real-life settings with INSTI- versus\nboosted-PI-based regimens. ^\\ \\ 18^\n\nTwo participants (1.7%) had HBV coinfection at baseline. The protocol\ndid not require modification because BIC/FTC/TAF is also effective\nagainst HBV, while the 8/131 (6%) participants of the STAT trial who\nwere HBV-coinfected had to switch from the study treatment\n(dolutegravir/lamivudine) to a tenofovir-containing regimen and were\nclassified as failures in ITT analysis. ^\\ \\ 16^\n\nPharmacologically, the plasma concentrations of BIC measured 24 h after\nthe last drug intake in this study closely paralleled those of the\nGILEAD studies. ^\\ \\ 19^ Adequate *C* ~24h~ values were determined in\nthe majority of patients during the follow-up period, suggesting good\nadherence to BIC/FTC/TAF in this same-day initiation strategy. All\nparticipants experiencing PDVF had high baseline viral loads between\n247 713 and 10 000 000 copies/mL with a median viral load of 880 000\ncopies/mL. Our results were consistent with a previous study evaluating\nvirological suppression in participants with baseline viral loads of\n\\>500 000 copies/mL. ^\\ \\ 20^ Although expected, the low\ninter-individual variability of these plasma concentrations calculated\nbetween W4, W12, W24 and W48 also underlines and confirms the regularity\nand ease of daily intake of this single-tablet regimen.\n\nIn our study, there was a low incidence of side effects and only a few\nled to discontinuation of study medication. Dizziness is frequently\nreported with BIC/FTC/TAF (≥1/100, \\<1/10) unlike the other side effects\nreported that led to study discontinuation (modification of fat\ndistribution and dryness of the mouth). Those are not commonly reported\nin the summary of product characteristics. BMI gain is commonly\ndescribed during the first 2 years of the initiation of ART for\nantiretroviral-naive individuals, and particularly in PLWH receiving\nINSTIs. ^\\ \\ 5\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 6\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 21^ Use of INSTIs was linked with more\nweight gain than were PIs or NNRTIs. ^\\ \\ 22--23^ Our results are\nconsistent with previous reports in this predominantly young, male and\nCaucasian population. ^\\ \\ 5\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 6^ Newer HIV medicines are less\nlikely to cause lipodystrophy than HIV medicines developed in the past\nand lipodystrophy is not described with BIC/FTC/TAF, but we must be\nvigilant since the mechanisms of fat alterations in PLWH are complex,\nmultifactorial and not fully understood. ^\\ \\ 24^ Anxiety has frequently\nbeen reported among PLWH; ^\\ \\ 25\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 26^ however, data showing its\nevolution following ART initiation are sparse. Our results showed a\nsignificant decrease in anxiety after ART initiation, which was likely\nto be more easily observed in the context of newly diagnosed patients\nwho had to process a diagnosis of a serious condition that requires\nlife-long treatment. The positive perception towards treatment, as shown\nby the high levels of treatment satisfaction found in this study, was\nprobably a key factor in diminishing anxiety following treatment\ninitiation.\n\nOur findings suggest that patients newly diagnosed with HIV-1 infection\nwho initiated a fixed combination of BIC/FTC/TAF, on the day of their\nfirst medical appointment, were able to achieve and maintain high\ntreatment satisfaction scores throughout 48 weeks. As a result of the\ninitiation on the same day as the first medical appointment, median\n(IQR) delay between diagnosis of HIV and initiation of ART was 8 (5--17)\ndays, which is still not optimal compared with WHO test-and-treat\nrecommendations. Interventions targeted on reducing the length between\ndiagnosis and first medical appointment need to be implemented in order\nfor newly diagnosed PLWH not to have to wait to be seen after testing.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThese data provide evidence that BIC/FTC/TAF is an effective and\nwell-tolerated single-tablet option for initiation of ART on the same\nday as the first medical appointment. It was associated with high\ntreatment acceptability and adherence, which are critical components of\nmaintaining viral suppression and reducing transmission. Taken together,\nthe efficacy, safety and acceptability of BIC/FTC/TAF support its use as\nsame-day initiation as recommended in most treatment guidelines.\n\n\n## Funding\n\nThis study was funded by Gilead Sciences. The funder had no role in\nstudy design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or\npreparation of the manuscript.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 37131300\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: \"Study Population\nAdult (>18 years) TN and TE patients were included in the study.

Here, we report the\nantiretroviral therapy as long acting suppression (ATLAS)-2M study week\n152 results.\n\n### Methods\n\nATLAS-2M is a phase 3b, randomized, multicenter study assessing the\nefficacy and safety of CAB+RPV LA every 8 weeks (Q8W) versus every 4\nweeks (Q4W). Virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA \\<50 copies/mL)\nindividuals were randomized to receive CAB+RPV LA Q8W or Q4W. Endpoints\nincluded the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50\ncopies/mL and \\<50 copies/mL, incidence of confirmed virologic failure\n(CVF; 2 consecutive measurements ≥200 copies/mL), safety, and\ntolerability.\n\n### Results\n\nA total of 1045 participants received CAB+RPV LA (Q8W, n = 522; Q4W, n =\n523). CAB+RPV LA Q8W demonstrated noninferior efficacy versus Q4W\ndosing, with 2.7% (n = 14) and 1.0% (n = 5) of participants having HIV-1\nRNA ≥50 copies/mL, respectively, with adjusted treatment difference\nbeing 1.7% (95% CI: 0.1--3.3%), meeting the 4% noninferiority threshold.\nAt week 152, 87% of participants maintained HIV-1 RNA \\<50 copies/mL\n(Q8W, 87% \\[n = 456\\]; Q4W, 86% \\[n = 449\\]). Overall, 12 (2.3%)\nparticipants in the Q8W arm and 2 (0.4%) in the Q4W arm had CVF. Eight\nand 10 participants with CVF had treatment-emergent,\nresistance-associated mutations to RPV and integrase inhibitors,\nrespectively. Safety profiles were comparable, with no new safety\nsignals observed since week 48.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThese data demonstrate virologic suppression durability with CAB+RPV LA\nQ8W or Q4W for ∼3 years and confirm long-term efficacy, safety, and\ntolerability of CAB+RPV LA as a complete regimen to maintain HIV-1\nvirologic suppression.\n\n\n## METHODS\n\n### Study Design\n\nATLAS-2M is a phase 3b randomized, open-label, active-controlled,\nmulticenter, parallel-group noninferiority study to evaluate the\nefficacy, safety, and tolerability of CAB+RPV LA administered Q8W versus\nQ4W in virologically suppressed PWH. The full inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria, study design, and procedures have been previously published \\[\n10 \\]. The full study protocol is available online \\[ 19 \\].\n\nThe ATLAS-2M study was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki\n\\[ 20 \\]. All participants provided written informed consent. The study\nprotocol, amendments, informed consent, and other information that\nrequired preapproval were reviewed and approved by a national, regional,\nor investigational center ethics committee or institutional review\nboard.\n\n### Randomization\n\nFull details of randomization have been published previously \\[ 10 \\].\nParticipants were randomly assigned (unblinded) 1:1 to receive CAB+RPV\nLA Q8W or Q4W. Randomization was stratified by previous CAB+RPV exposure\n(0 weeks, 1--24 weeks, \\>24 weeks) to account for individuals who\ntransitioned from the ATLAS study having received CAB+RPV LA \\[ 10 \\].\n\n### Outcomes\n\nThe primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma\nHIV-1 RNA of 50 copies/mL or greater at week 48 using the US Food and\nDrug Administration Snapshot algorithm \\[ 21 \\], as previously published\n\\[ 10 \\]. Endpoints assessed at week 152 included the following: the\nproportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL\nand HIV-1 RNA of 50 copies/mL or greater, incidence of confirmed\nvirologic failure (CVF; 2 consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA measurements ≥200\ncopies/mL), treatment-emergent genotypic and phenotypic resistance,\nincidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), proportion of\ndiscontinuations due to AEs, CAB+RPV pharmacokinetics, and treatment\nsatisfaction measured using the HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire\nstatus version (HIVTSQs) \\[ 22 \\].\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\nThe efficacy analyses performed at week 152 included the proportion of\nparticipants with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL and 50\ncopies/mL or greater, per the Snapshot algorithm at week 152, based on\nthe intention-to-treat exposed (ITT-E) population and per-protocol\npopulation. The analysis method and stratification factors from the\nprimary analyses \\[ 10 \\] were used, with modifications to include\ncoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)--related reasons for participants\nhaving no virologic data.\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Participant Characteristics and Disposition\n\nOverall, 1045 participants were included in the ITT-E population (Q8W, n\n= 522; Q4W, n = 523); 391 (37%) participants had prior CAB+RPV exposure.\nBaseline characteristics were previously published \\[ 10 \\]. The number\nof participants in the study at the week 152 data cutoff was similar in\nboth arms (Q8W, n = 452 \\[87%\\]; Q4W, n = 447 \\[85%\\]) ( Figure 1 ).\nOverall, there were 139 treatment withdrawals (Q8W, n = 65 \\[12%\\]; Q4W,\nn = 74 \\[14%\\]), including 20 participants in the Q8W arm and 24\nparticipants in the Q4W arm since the 96-week analysis \\[ 18 \\]. The\nmost common reason for withdrawal was participant decision, which\noccurred less frequently in the Q8W arm than in the Q4W arm (3% vs 7%).\nThe most common reasons for withdrawal by a participant included\nfrequency of visits (Q8W, n = 4 \\[\\<1%\\]; Q4W, n = 10 \\[2%\\]),\nparticipant relocation (Q8W, n = 1 \\[\\<1%\\]; Q4W, n = 6 \\[1%\\]), and\ninjection intolerability (Q8W, n = 1 \\[\\<1%\\]; Q4W, n = 8 \\[2%\\]).\n\nFigure 1.\n\nParticipant disposition. No study withdrawals were due to COVID-19\nadverse events; however, 2 participants withdrew for COVID-19--related\nreasons (travel restrictions, n = 1; participant did not want to return\nto the clinic due to the pandemic, n = 1). ^a^ A total of 1049\nparticipants were randomized. However, 4 participants did not receive\nthe study drug and therefore were not part of the ITT-E population. ^b^\nSeven participants completed the maintenance phase but did not enter the\nextension phase (Q8W, n = 5; Q4W, n = 2). Abbreviations: CAB,\ncabotegravir; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; ITT-E,\nintention-to-treat exposed; LA, long-acting; Q4W, every 4 weeks; Q8W,\nevery 8 weeks; RPV, rilpivirine.\n\nMost injection visits occurred within the 7-day window (Q8W, n =\n9509/9809 \\[97%\\]; Q4W, n = 18 829/19 321 \\[97%\\]) ( Supplementary\nFigure 1 ). Overall, 44 (\\<1%) injection visits in the Q8W group and 98\n(\\<1%) injection visits in the Q4W group were missed (outside the ±7-day\nwindow with oral therapy), and participants were administered CAB+RPV\noral therapy (Q8W, n = 37/9809 \\[\\<1%\\]; Q4W, n = 90/19 321 \\[\\<1%\\]) or\nan alternative oral ART regimen (Q8W, n = 7/9809 \\[\\<1%\\]; Q4W, n = 8/19\n321 \\[\\<1%\\]) until resuming injectable therapy. Most interruptions\noccurred after week 96 (Q8W, n = 31/37 \\[84%\\]; Q4W, n = 65/90 \\[72%\\]).\nIn total, 38 (\\<1%) injection visits in the Q8W group and 69 (\\<1%)\ninjection visits in the Q4W group were missed due to COVID-19 infection\nor clinic disruption. One injection visit (Q8W; week 112) was missed\nwithout oral coverage (COVID-19 related); this participant resumed\nCAB+RPV LA at week 128 and maintained virologic suppression.\n\n### Efficacy\n\nAfter 152 weeks of therapy, Q8W dosing of CAB+RPV LA continued to\ndemonstrate similar antiviral activity compared with Q4W dosing ( Table\n1 ). At week 152, 14 (3%) participants in the Q8W arm and 5 (1%) in the\nQ4W arm had HIV-1 RNA of 50 copies/mL or greater. The adjusted treatment\ndifference in proportions was 1.7% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\]:\n.1--3.3%), meeting the prespecified 4% noninferiority threshold. At week\n152, 87% (n = 456/522) of participants in the Q8W arm and 86% (n =\n449/523) in the Q4W arm had HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies/mL. The\nadjusted treatment difference (Q8W -- Q4W arm) in proportions was 1.5%\n(95% CI: −2.6% to 5.6%), meeting the prespecified −10% noninferiority\nthreshold. Tests for homogeneity were not significantly different by\nprior CAB+RPV exposure strata (HIV-1 RNA: \\<50 copies/mL \\[ *P* =\n.441\\]; ≥50 copies/mL \\[ *P* = .146\\]). No treatment differences between\nQ8W and Q4W dosing regimens for the proportion of participants with\nHIV-1 RNA of 50 copies/mL or greater and less than 50 copies/mL were\nobserved within most of the demographic and baseline characteristic\nsubgroups ( Supplementary Figures 2 and 3 ).\n\nNoninferiority was determined if the upper bound of the 95% CI about the\nadjusted Q8W--Q4W difference was below 4%.\n\nNoninferiority was determined if the lower bound of the 95% CI about the\nadjusted Q8W--Q4W difference was above −10%.\n\nFour deaths occurred since the 96-week analysis (Q8W, n = 2; Q4W, n =\n2).\n\nOther reasons included: Q8W---withdrawal by participant (n = 16),\nphysician decision (n = 5), protocol deviation (n = 2),\nprotocol-specified withdrawal criterion met (n = 2), lost to follow-up\n(n = 2), lack of efficacy (n = 1); Q4W---withdrawal by participant (n =\n33), protocol deviation (n = 4), physician decision (n = 3),\nprotocol-specified withdrawal criterion met (n = 3), lost to follow-up\n(n = 1).\n\nMissing data were related to COVID-19.\n\nOne-sided *P* value from weighted least-squares chi-square statistic. A\n*P* value \\<.10 indicates statistically significant evidence of\nheterogeneity in the difference in proportions across levels of each\nanalysis stratum.\n\nOne participant had a non--protocol-defined virologic failure. This\nparticipant met the SVF criterion at week 48 with an HIV-1 RNA value of\n918 copies/mL; however, virologic failure was not confirmed at the week\n48 retest result (39 copies/mL). At week 56, HIV-1 RNA was elevated\nagain at 1038 copies/mL.\n\n### Virologic Failure\n\nOverall, there were numerically more virologic failures in the Q8W arm\n(2% \\[n = 12/522\\]), including 2 participants since week 96 \\[ 18 \\],\nthan in the Q4W arm (\\<1% \\[n = 2/523\\]; no new CVFs since week 48). An\nadditional participant in the Q8W arm experienced a\nnon--protocol-defined virologic failure at week 48 and is included in\nthe total ( Supplementary Table 1 ). This participant was classified as\nhaving virologic failure after the week 96 publication based on an\nexploratory viral load assay. Excluding the participant with\nnon--protocol-defined virologic failure, 5 (45%) of the 11 participants\nwith CVF through week 96 developed RPV resistance-associated mutations\n(RAMs) (Y188L, K101E, K101E + E138A, E138E/K, K101E + M230L) in\ncombination with INSTI RAMs (Q148Q/R + N155N/H, Q148R, N155H, Q148R +\nE138E/K). Both participants with CVF since week 96 had\ntreatment-emergent RAMs to RPV (E138A + M230M/L, E138A + Y181Y/C) and\nINSTIs (Q148R) at suspected virologic failure (SVF) ( Supplementary\nTable 1 ). The additional participant who had non--protocol-defined\nvirologic failure at week 48 (Q8W) had no RAMs to RPV or INSTIs present\nfrom baseline peripheral blood mononuclear cells; the RPV RAM E138K and\nthe integrase inhibitor mutation S230S/R were detected at week 56. Most\ncases of CVF occurred by or at week 48 (n = 11/14 \\[79%\\]).\n\nOf the 14 participants with CVF, 6 (43%) had 2 or more of the baseline\nfactors associated with increased risk of CVF with this regimen\n(pro-viral RPV RAMs, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, body mass index \\[BMI\\] ≥30\nkg/m ^2^ ) \\[ 23 \\]. One of the 2 participants with CVF since week 96\nhad an associated baseline factor (HIV-1 subtype A6/A1). All\nparticipants with CVF through 152 weeks received injections within 7\ndays of the scheduled visit. Overall, 13 of 14 (93%) participants with\nCVF achieved virologic re-suppression on subsequent oral ART regimens\n(protease inhibitor-based regimen \\[71%, n = 10/14\\] or dolutegravir\n\\[DTG\\]-based regimen \\[21%, n = 3/14\\]); the participant who did not\nre-suppress was nonadherent to the subsequent oral therapy, as reported\npreviously \\[ 10 \\].\n\n### Safety\n\nCAB+RPV LA was well tolerated, with similar AE profiles between arms (\nTable 2 ). Drug-related AEs (per investigator assessment) were common\nand comparable across arms (Q8W, n = 427 \\[82%\\]; Q4W, n = 427 \\[82%\\]).\nThis finding is largely attributable to injection-site reactions (ISRs),\nwhich represent 64% (n = 545/854) of all participants with drug-related\nAEs. Excluding ISRs, 27% (n = 142) of participants in the Q8W arm and\n32% (n = 167) in the Q4W arm experienced a drug-related AE. The most\ncommonly occurring AEs and drug-related AEs, excluding ISRs, are listed\nin Table 2 . Most AEs were grade 1 or 2 (n = 848/1011 \\[84%\\]). A total\nof 23 (4%) participants in the Q8W arm and 25 (5%) participants in the\nQ4W arm had AEs leading to withdrawal. Of these participants, 5 withdrew\nfrom the Q8W arm and 6 withdrew from the Q4W arm after week 96. No\ndrug-related serious AEs (SAEs) were reported after week 96 \\[ 10 , 18\n\\]. Since the week 96 analyses, 4 deaths occurred, as detailed in Table\n2 ; none were considered by the investigator to be related to the study\ndrugs. No additional safety signals were identified since the week 48\nanalysis \\[ 10 \\].\n\nWeek 48 and week 96 data have been presented previously \\[ 10 , 18 \\].\n\nDrug-related SAEs (per investigator assessment) were injection-site\nabscess (n = 1), osteonecrosis (n = 1), presyncope (n = 1), and acute\npancreatitis and sepsis (n = 1) in the Q8W arm, and hypersensitivity and\nsuspected (partial) intravenous administration of RPV (n = 1), drug\nhypersensitivity and suspected postinjection reaction (n = 1), and\nmyocardial infarction (n = 1) in the Q4W group.\n\nAn additional participant died 2 months after completing the long-term\nfollow-up. This was due to respiratory failure secondary to cardiac\narrest.\n\nSuicide (n = 1) and pancreatic cancer (n = 1).\n\nCardiac arrest (n = 1) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and\nchronic renal failure (n = 1).\n\nOverall, 60 041 injections were administered with 9662 ISRs ( Table 3 ).\nMost ISRs were grade 1 or 2 (n = 9558/9662 \\[99%\\]), with a median\nduration of 3 days (interquartile range \\[IQR\\]: 2--5 days) for both\ntreatment arms, and 84% (n = 8071/9663) resolved within 7 days. There\nwere no grade 4 or 5 ISRs. Injection-site pain was the most frequent ISR\nin both treatment groups (Q8W, 77% of ISRs \\[n = 3189/4168\\]; Q4W, 76%\nof ISRs \\[n = 4180/5494\\]). The types and severity of ISR events were\nsimilar between treatment arms, except for injection-site nodules, which\noccurred more often in the Q4W group. The number of participants\nreporting ISRs at each visit decreased over the first 48 weeks and\nremained stable thereafter ( Figure 2 ). Four participants withdrew due\nto injection-related reasons since the week 96 analysis, citing\ninjection intolerability.\n\nFigure 2.\n\nISRs over time. ^a^ AE grade is the maximum grade reported by the\nparticipant at each visit. ^b^ There were no grade 4 or 5 ISRs.\nAbbreviations: AE, adverse event; CAB, cabotegravir; ISR, injection-site\nreaction; LA, long-acting; NA, not applicable; Q4W, every 4 weeks; Q8W,\nevery 8 weeks; RPV, rilpivirine.\n\nEach ISR event was counted separately. A participant may have had\nmultiple ISR events following a single injection.\n\nThere were no grade 4 or grade 5 ISRs.\n\nPercentages are calculated from the total number of ISR events.\n\nPercentages are calculated from the total number of injections.\n\nQ8W: 3189 injection-site pain events occurred in 398/522 (76%)\nparticipants; Q4W: 4180 injection-site pain events occurred in 387/523\n(74%) participants.\n\nQ8W: 259 injection-site nodule events occurred in 91/522 (17%)\nparticipants; Q4W: 457 injection-site nodule events occurred in 141/523\n(27%) participants.\n\nPercentages are calculated from the total number of participants with\ninjections (Q8W, n = 516/522 \\[99%\\]; Q4W, n = 517/523 \\[99%\\]).\n\nMedian (IQR) weight gain from baseline to week 152 was +2.0 kg (−0.6 to\n6.0 kg) in the Q8W arm and +1.7 kg (−1.2 to 5.0 kg) in the Q4W arm, of\nwhich +0.2 kg and +0.35 kg was gained between week 96 and week 152,\nrespectively. Most participants remained in the same BMI category since\nbaseline (Q8W, n = 332/522 \\[64%\\]; Q4W, n = 343/523 \\[66%\\]) (\nSupplementary Figure 4 ).\n\nSince the week 96 analysis, no clinically meaningful differences were\nobserved between the Q8W and Q4W arms for any electrocardiogram\nparameters or vital signs. Six participants (Q8W, n = 4 \\[1%\\]; Q4W, n =\n2 \\[\\<1%\\]) had alanine aminotransferase elevations at least 3 times the\nupper limit of the normal range since week 96, 4 (\\<1%) of whom\ncontinued treatment. The remaining 2 (\\<1%) participants met the\nliver-stopping criteria (ie, abnormal alanine aminotransferase and\nbilirubin concentrations). One event was associated with fatal\npancreatic cancer. The other participant had chronic HIV and hepatitis C\ncoinfection with a history of binge alcohol abuse and continued\nreceiving CAB+RPV LA dosing. Both were deemed not drug-related per\ninvestigator assessment.\n\n### Pharmacokinetics\n\nThe median CAB and RPV pre-dose concentrations for both dosing regimens\nare shown in Supplementary Figure 5 . At week 152, geometric mean CAB\npre-dose concentrations ranged from 1.45 μg/mL to 1.98 μg/mL for the Q8W\narm and 2.75 μg/mL to 2.83 μg/mL for the Q4W arm across the 3 previous\nCAB+RPV exposure strata and were comparable to the week 48 and week 96\nresults. Geometric mean RPV pre-dose concentrations at week 152 ranged\nfrom 95.7 ng/mL to 105 ng/mL for the Q8W arm and 132 ng/mL to 153 ng/mL\nfor the Q4W arm across the 3 previous CAB+RPV exposure strata. Geometric\nmean RPV pre-dose concentration in participants in the Q8W arm increased\nfrom 65.4 ng/mL at week 48 to 95.7 ng/mL at week 152 for participants\nwith no prior exposure, and from 77.6 ng/mL at week 48 to 105 ng/mL at\nweek 152 for participants with 1--24 weeks of previous exposure. These\nfindings are consistent with the 28-week half-life of RPV LA, resulting\nin ongoing accumulation beyond the first year of treatment. In\nparticipants with more than 24 weeks of prior exposure, apparent steady\nstate for RPV was achieved by week 48, with little further accumulation\nat week 152.\n\nPlasma drug concentrations for participants with CVF ( Supplementary\nTable 1 ) were generally in the first quartile of the overall study\ngeometric mean values, but above the protein-adjusted concentration\nrequired for 90% inhibition (PA-IC ~90~ ) values for both agents.\n\nPlasma CAB and RPV concentrations were available for 95 participants\n(Q8W, n = 48/522 \\[9%\\]; Q4W, n = 47/523 \\[9%\\]) who stopped injectable\ntherapy and entered the long-term follow-up phase, with concentrations\nshown in Supplementary Table 2 . Notably, the geometric mean value\nremained above the PA-IC ~90~ value 6 months after the last injection\nfor CAB and 12 months for RPV.\n\n### Treatment Satisfaction\n\nIn participants without prior CAB+RPV exposure, HIVTSQs mean scores\nmarkedly increased from baseline to week 152 for both treatment arms,\nand significantly favored Q8W dosing at all 3 time points (\nSupplementary Figure 6 ).\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThe noninferior efficacy of CAB+RPV LA Q8W dosing compared with Q4W\ndosing at week 152 of the phase 3b ATLAS-2M study confirms and extends\nthe 48-week and 96-week results, demonstrating that CAB+RPV LA dosed Q8W\nis a durable and effective therapy for the maintenance of HIV-1\nvirologic suppression in PWH. At week 152, 2.7% of participants\nreceiving CAB+RPV LA Q8W and 1.0% receiving Q4W had HIV-1 RNA of 50\ncopies/mL or greater. Overall, 87% of participants maintained virologic\nsuppression after 152 weeks of LA therapy (Q8W or Q4W), supporting the\ndurability of CAB+RPV LA over approximately 3 years. Virologic failure\nthrough week 152 occurred more frequently in the CAB+RPV LA Q8W arm (2%)\nthan in the Q4W arm (\\<1%). Similar rates have been reported in switch\nstudies of dual oral therapy with DTG-RPV, with 1% of participants\nmeeting the protocol-defined confirmed virologic withdrawal criteria\n(HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL and a confirmatory measurement of HIV-1 RNA\n≥200 copies/mL) at week 148 of the SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 studies (Regimen\nSwitch to Dolutegravir + Rilpivirine From Current Antiretroviral Regimen\nin Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Infected and Virologically\nSuppressed Adults) \\[ 24 \\]. Participant retention was high through week\n152, with 87% (n = 452) of Q8W and 85% (n = 447) of Q4W participants\nremaining in the study, demonstrating that most participants receiving\ninjectable therapy wanted to continue injections after approximately 3\nyears of CAB+RPV. These Q8W data have recently been replicated in the\nCARISEL study \\[ 25 \\].\n\nTreatment compliance was high, with 97% (n = 28 338/29 130) of\ninjections received within the allowed dosing window and only 1\ninjection missed without a planned alternative oral therapy (COVID-19\nrelated). The use of oral therapy to cover missed doses increased during\nthe extension phase (post--week 100), mainly attributable to\nCOVID-19--related clinic disruption. Missed injections were more\nfrequent in the Q4W arm than in the Q8W arm, suggesting that the longer\ndosing intervals may offer additional flexibility to better accommodate\nparticipants' schedules or an emergent pandemic. There were fewer\nwithdrawals due to participant choice in the Q8W arm (n = 17 \\[3%\\])\ncompared with the Q4W arm (n = 36 \\[7%\\]), which may reflect this\nincreased convenience of Q8W dosing.\n\nSince the week 96 analysis, 2 additional participants in the Q8W arm had\nCVF. No additional CVFs occurred in the Q4W arm. One\nnon--protocol-defined failure (\\<1%, n = 1/1045) was identified at week\n48 and is also reported. Except for 1 participant who was nonadherent to\nthe subsequent oral therapy, these (n = 13/14) participants achieved\nre-suppression on an alternative oral treatment regimen (protease\ninhibitor--based regimen \\[71%, n = 10/14\\] or DTG-based regimen \\[21%,\nn = 3/14\\]). Seven participants with CVF in the Q8W arm and 1\nparticipant in the Q4W arm developed RPV RAMs through week 152. The 2\nparticipants with CVF since the week 96 analysis had no RPV or INSTI\nRAMs at baseline; however, both had treatment-emergent RAMs in SVF\nsamples ( Supplementary Table 1 ). The RPV RAMs were detected in\nprevious ATLAS-2M participants with CVF \\[ 10 , 18 \\].\n\nMultivariable analyses of phase 3 studies, including ATLAS-2M,\nidentified 3 baseline factors associated with increased risk of CVF when\npresent in combination of 2 or more factors (pro-viral RPV RAMs, HIV-1\nsubtype A6/A1, and/or BMI ≥30 kg/m ^2^ ) during the first year of\nCAB+RPV initiation \\[ 23 \\]. Dosing regimen (Q8W vs Q4W) was not\nidentified as a significant risk factor \\[ 23 \\]. Although 6 of 14 (43%)\nparticipants with CVF had 2 or more of these associated factors at\nbaseline, only 1 of the 2 participants with CVF since week 96 had an\nassociated baseline factor (HIV-1 subtype A6/A1). Expanded multivariable\nanalyses of predictors of CVF are ongoing.\n\nCAB+RPV LA was well tolerated, with a comparable safety profile between\nthe treatment arms. Specifically, the proportions of participants\nreporting SAEs, AEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal were similar for Q8W\nand Q4W dosing, consistent with previous analyses \\[ 10 , 18 \\]. No new\nsafety signals were identified since the week 48 analysis. The number of\nISRs experienced across both treatment arms was similar and consistent\nwith previous analyses from ATLAS \\[ 17 \\], FLAIR \\[ 16 \\], and ATLAS-2M\n\\[ 10 , 18 \\], with most ISRs being mild to moderate and short lived,\nwith few discontinuations. The frequency of ISRs at each visit decreased\nover the first 48 weeks and remained consistent thereafter, as\ndemonstrated in the FLAIR 96-week analysis \\[ 16 \\]. The median weight\nchange at week 152 increased since the week 96 analysis \\[ 18 \\] but\nremained similar to that reported in a pooled analysis of clinical\ntrials for other INSTIs \\[ 26 \\].\n\nCAB+RPV LA demonstrated high satisfaction levels in both treatment arms,\nwith participants favoring the Q8W dosing regimen at all time points.\nThis aligns with the high satisfaction and preference for CAB+RPV LA in\npatient-reported outcome analyses \\[ 17 , 27 \\].\n\nThe observed CAB and RPV plasma concentrations were consistent with\nprevious observations. Mean CAB and RPV concentrations were lower in\nparticipants receiving Q8W dosing compared with Q4W dosing. For both\nregimens, the concentrations were above the respective PA-IC ~90~\nvalues, and virologic suppression was similar for both dosing regimens.\nFor both regimens, RPV appeared to reach near steady state by week 96,\nand steady state was confirmed for CAB by week 48. This is consistent\nwith the longer half-life for RPV (13--28 weeks) compared with CAB\n(5.6--11.5 weeks) \\[ 14 \\]. CAB and RPV concentrations following Q4W\ndosing recapitulated those observed with Q4W dosing in FLAIR, and\nconcentrations for Q8W dosing were consistent with those observed with\nQ8W dosing in LATTE-2 (long-acting intramuscular cabotegravir and\nrilpivirine in adults with HIV-1 infection) and ATLAS \\[ 9 , 16 , 17 ,\n28 \\].\n\nVariable RPV concentrations have been observed in real-world evidence\nstudies and are potentially associated with therapeutic failure or\ntoxicity; however, the majority of participants with CVF in the present\nstudy had RPV concentrations 3-fold greater than the PA-IC ~90~ \\[ 29\n\\].\n\n### Limitations\n\nThe current study has several limitations. The lack of blinding may have\ncaused participants to anticipate and report more AEs due to the\nadministration of CAB+RPV LA. Due to the difference in dosing frequency,\nmore frequent safety assessments were performed for the Q4W arm than the\nQ8W arm, which may have increased the number of AEs reported in the Q4W\narm. A direct comparison with oral treatments was not possible due to\nthe lack of an oral ART comparator arm. While a post hoc indirect\nanalysis showed comparability of Q8W dosing with oral therapy \\[ 30 \\],\ndefinitive conclusions cannot be made regarding adherence benefits with\nCAB+RPV LA versus oral ART from these data.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nIn summary, CAB+RPV LA dosed Q8W continued to be noninferior to Q4W\ntherapy at 152 weeks. These long-term data demonstrate that CAB+RPV LA\nadministered monthly or Q2M is an effective, durable, and well-tolerated\ntreatment for the maintenance of HIV-1 virologic suppression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***Data sharing* .** Data sharing requests will be considered by the\nmanagement group upon written request to the corresponding author.\nDeidentified participant data or other prespecified data will be\navailable subject to a written proposal and a signed data sharing\nagreement.\n\n***Financial support.*** This work was supported by ViiV Healthcare and\nJanssen Research and Development.

The remaining six individuals were prescribed either a combination of lamivudine and stavudine (3TC/d4T; n = 1), lamivudine and nevirapine (3TC/NVP; n = 2), Duovir and Stocrin (3TC/AZT and EFV; n = 2), or Stocrin alone (EFV; n = 1).\nRationale: The paper lists the specific drugs that were part of the treatment regimens for the individuals in  the study, including lamivudine, stavudine, nevirapine, zidovudine, and efavirenz, which includes both NRTI and NNRTI.\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI\n\nPMID: 36016383\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be transmitted via parenteral, sexual, or vertical exposure routes. The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences.

However, there has been no extensive study of CSF\nresistance. The aim of this study is to evaluate common HIV-1 resistance\nin CSF and compare it with resistance in matched plasma, and analyse the\ninfluencing factors of cerebrospinal fluid drug resistance. The matched\nCSF and plasma samples of 62 HIV-1 patients were tested at one study\nsite in China (Chongqing; 2019--2022). HIV genotyping and drug\nresistance was evaluated using the Stanford v8.7 algorithm. The\ndiagnosis and treatment data and basic information were collected from\nthe clinical case system, and the influencing factors of drug resistance\nmutations in CSF was obtained by variance analysis. CSF and matched\nplasma HIV-1 subtypes were confirmed in 62 patients, and the most\nfrequent recombinant form was CRF07-BC (64.5%). Thirteen patients\n(21.0%) were detected with drug-resistant mutations, and the sites were\nconsistent in both CSF and matched plasma. The drug-resistant ratios of\nuntreated patients and treated patients were 5/51 (9.8%) and 8/11\n(72.7%), respectively. The type with the highest mutation frequency was\nNNRTI, and no mutation was found in INSTI. Multivariate analysis\nindicated that ARV treatment was associated with CSF resistance ( *P*\n\\< 0.001). The subtypes and drug resistance mutation sites are\nconsistent in CSF and matched plasma samples of HIV-1 patients, and\nthere is a correlation between ARV treatment and possible drug\nresistance, especially in CSF reservoirs. These findings highlight the\nconcern about CSF drug resistance in HIV patients.\n\n\n## Patients and methods\n\n### Patients\n\nWe retrospectively collected matched pairs of 68 HIV-1 patients who were\nadmitted to Chongqing Public Health Medical Center from June 2020 to\nJune 2022 and completed plasma CD4+ T cell counts, HIV RNA viral load,\nand CSF biochemical tests. CSF and plasma samples were tested for drug\nresistance of HIV genotypes. Among them, 6 patients had low CSF viral\nload and could not be tested for drug resistance. As a result, a total\nof 62 patients were included in this study, and all test reports were\nrecorded. Demographic characteristics (sex, age) and clinical data\n(diagnosis time, CSF HIV RNA, total protein amount in CSF, CSF glucose,\nCSF white blood cell count, treatment regimen, plasma CD4 cell count) of\nthese patients were collected and anonymously analysed. Thus, the usual\nrequirement of written or oral informed consent is waived. This study\nhas been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Chongqing Public\nHealth Medical Center.\n\n\n\n## HIV-1 gene amplification and drug resistance analysis\n\nWe amplified the nucleotide sequences of HIV-1 protease, reverse\ntranscriptase and integrase using nested polymerase chain reaction\n(nest-pcr) method. A viral nucleic acid extraction kit (Jiangsu Shuoshi\nCompany, China) was used to extract RNA from 00 μL plasma and CFS. The\nfirst round of PCR was performed using the HiScript® II One-Step RT-PCR\nKit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China), followed by the second round of nested PCR\nusing Ace Taq kit (Vazyme, Nanjing China). One-step RT-PCR and nested\nPCR was performed on a GeneAmp®9700PCR instrument (ABI, USA). The target\nbands were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis for validation,\nand the amplified product was sequenced. Sequences were then spliced and\nedited using the Seqman pro and Megalign7.0V software, and were\nsubmitted to the drug resistance database of Stanford University (\nhttps://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-sequences/ ) for HIV-1 subtypes and\nresistance mutation analysis. PCR primers are listed in Supplementary\nTable 1.\n\n\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nAll data analyses were performed using the software SPSS 22.0.\nQuantitative variables are expressed as medians and IQR, and qualitative\nvariables are expressed as percentages (%). The influencing factors\n(age, gender, duration of diagnosis, ARV treatment or not, plasma CD4\ncount, CSF HIV RNA, CSF HIV subtypes, CSF total protein, CSF glucose,\nCSF white blood cell count) related to drug resistance were selected for\none-way analysis of variance. Variables with significant differences in\none-way ANOVA were included in multi-factor ANOVA.\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Demographic characteristics\n\nOverall, 62 HIV-1 patients with a median (IQR) age of 51 (38--64) years\n(51 ARV non- treated, including 49 naive; 11 ARV treated) were analysed\n( Table 1 ). CSF protein amount, glucose, and leukocyte content were\ncomparable between patients who received or not received ARV treatment.\nThe median CSF HIV-1 RNA (IQR) in ARV-non-treated and ARV-treated\npatients was 4.99 (4.47--5.72) and 4.47 (4.07--4.92) log10 copies/ml,\nrespectively; the median plasma HIV-1 RNA (IQR) was 5.80 (5.48--6.32)\nand 5.30 (3.72--5.73) log10 copies/ml. The median CD4 cell count values\n(IQR) in non-treated and treated patients were 61 (35--106) and 76\n(23--136) cells/mm ^3^ , respectively. All patients were infected with\nnon-b subtype, and the most common recombinant form was CRF07-BC\n(64.5%). Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) were the\nmain drugs used in ARV-treated patients ( Table 1 ).\n\n\n## Drug resistance differences between cerebrospinal fluid and plasma genotypes\n\nNext, the differences in drug resistance between CSF and plasma samples\nwere analysed. Among the 13 patients with resistance mutation sites, the\nCSF and plasma subtypes were identical, mainly CRF07-BC ( *n* = 5), and\nthe mutation sites were consistent, and most of the patient had more\nthan one mutation site. The mutation subtypes were mainly nonnucleoside\nreverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), nucleotide reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and protease inhibitor (PI), and no\nmutation was found in integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI). Among\nARV-non-treated patients, 5/51 (9.8%) developed HIV-1 resistance\nmutations in both plasma and CSF: PI ( *n* = 2), NNRTI ( *n* = 3). The\nPI-related drug resistance mutation site was Q58E; the NNRTI-related\nmutation sites were mainly E138A/G and V179E ( Table 2 ); Among patients\nreceiving ARV treatment, 8/11 (72.7 %) had HIV-1 resistance mutations in\nboth plasma and CSF: PI ( *n* = 1), NRTI ( *n* = 2), NNRTI ( *n* = 1),\nNRTI+NNRTI ( *n* = 3), NRTI+NNRTI+PI ( *n* = 1). The PI-related drug\nresistance mutation sites are mainly Q58E, M46I, 54 V, V82A; the\nNRTI-related mutation sites are mainly 184 V/I, 65 R, Y115F, K70E/Q,\n41 L, D67N, K219N; the NNRTI-related mutation sites were mainly E138A/G,\nV179E/D, K101E/Q, 106 M/I, Y181C, G190A, K103N, and 227 L ( Table 2 ).\n\n\n## Risk factors related to drug resistance in CSF\n\nWe assessed the association of CSF resistance with demographic and\nclinical factors ( Table 3 ). Age, gender, duration of diagnosis, ARV\ntreatment or not, plasma CD4 count, CSF HIV RNA, CSF HIV subtypes, CSF\ntotal protein, CSF glucose, CSF white blood cell count were grouped and\nanalysed with one-way ANOVA. *P* values were 0.263, 0.689, 0.394, 0.000,\n0.054, 0.480, 0.271,0.989, 0.807, 0.552, respectively. According to the\n10% level of significance ( *P* \\< 0.10), we found that ARV\ntreatment/non-treatment and plasma CD4 counts were significant different\nin between groups. Therefore, we only performed multivariate analysis of\nvariance with the above two factors, and the *P* values were 0.000 for\nARV treatment and 0.370 for plasma CD4 count, suggesting receiving ARV\ntreatment contributes significantly.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study compared the PI, NRTI, NNRTI, and INSTI resistance profiles\nin CSF and plasma of HIV-1 patients for the first time, and demonstrated\nthat CSF and plasma have consistent drug resistance mutations. In\naddition, the statistical analysis of the factors associated with drug\nresistance in CSF confirmed that whether or not to receive ARV treatment\nwas significantly associated with the resistance.\n\nDue to the lack of correction function of HIV reverse transcriptase at\nreplication, physiological fluctuations of dNTP pools and asymmetric\nerror repair, the mutation rate of replication reaches 10 ^−4^ to 10\n^−5^ , which makes it almost impossible to determine the fidelity of a\nsingle round of replication \\[ ^13^ \\]. Although ARV therapy can\neffectively attenuate HIV-1 replication in the peripheral system, HIV-1\nvirus can still maintain chronic and persistent replication in the CNS\ndue to the protective effect of the blood-brain barrier \\[ ^14^ ^,^ ^15^\n\\]. This group of HIV-1 continuously replicates and evolves relatively\nindependently in the CNS, and can be transmitted to the peripheral blood\nthrough microglia and T lymphocytes \\[ ^16^ ^,^ ^17^ \\], thereby causing\nperipheral viral rebound and drug resistance. All drug-resistant\npatients in this study could be detected with a large amount of HIV-1 in\nCSF and plasma, which showed the same subtype profiles. The consistent\ndrug resistance profile also suggested that the HIV-1 in CSF and\nperipheral blood may be of the same origin. This was also confirmed by\nthe phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary Figure 1).\n\nCurrently, the international recommended ARV treatment regimen is\ncombination of NRTIs and third-class drugs, and the third-class drugs\ncan be NNRTIs or enhanced PIs or INSTIs; or compound single-tablet\nregimens (STR) \\[ ^18--20^ \\]. Long-term fixed drug treatment regimens\nare also prone to lead to common drug resistance mutations. For example,\nin our study, The NRTIs 3TC and TDF in multiple ARV treatment regimens\nare prone to cause 184 V/I and 65 R mutations; NNRTI EFV is prone to\ngenerate Y181C, G190A and K101E mutations; PI LPV/r appears to lead to\nM46I and V82A mutations \\[ ^21^ ^,^ ^22^ \\], and we also detected\nadditional PI-related mutation Q58E (3/13), which is consistent with the\ndrug resistance profile in China \\[ ^5^ ^,^ ^23^ \\]. Maybe there is an\nintrinsic evolutionary rate within the host that contributes to HIV drug\nresistance, but widespread use of low genetic barrier antiretrovirals\nalso contributes to the development of drug resistance \\[ ^21^ \\]. The\nincidence of drug resistance in middle and low-income countries is\nrising due to the antiretroviral treatment implementation with low\ngenetic barrier regimens based on 2NRTIs+NNRTI. For example, the 3TC of\nNRTIs, which has the lowest genetic barrier to drug resistance, may take\nonly two weeks to develop drug-resistant mutations \\[ ^20^ \\]. While\nINSTIs, as one of the latest ARV drugs used in developed countries, have\nhigher genetic barriers to resistance compared with NRTIs and NNRTIs.\nSince it is still in the initial stage of application of INSTIs in\nChina, no related drug resistance mutations have been found yet in this\nstudy \\[ ^24^ \\].\n\nEmerging evidence indicate that certain antiretroviral drugs have low\npenetration in the CNS \\[ ^25^ ^,^ ^26^ \\], and that insufficient drug\npenetration and/or lack of compliance predisposes to the emergence of\nCSF resistance \\[ ^27^ ^,^ ^28^ \\]. However, the current research on\nHIV-1 in CSF is mostly about the effect of HIV RNA on neurocognitive\ndysfunction, and little is known on the influencing factors of HIV-1\ndrug resistance mutation in CSF. Therefore, our study assessed the\ncorrelation between resistance and each variable and demonstrated that\nCSF resistance may be only related to whether or not to receive ARV\ntreatment. There was no correlation between resistance and factors\nincluding the duration of HIV diagnosis, HIV RNA in CSF, subtype, CSF\ntotal protein, CSF glucose, CSF white blood cell count, or CD4 count in\nplasma. Due to the limited amounts of specimens and detection methods,\nour results failed to detect a deeper underlying correlation between CSF\nresistance and influencing factors, or other relevant influencing\nfactors. Further efforts need to be put forward in future explorations.\n\nIn conclusion, the present study demonstrates consistent PI, NRTI, NNRTI\nand INSTI resistance profiles in the CNS and matched plasma of HIV-1\npatients. Meanwhile, the evaluation on the influencing factors of CSF\ndrug resistance shows that receiving ARV treatment may increase the\nincidence of HIV-1 drug resistance in CSF.\n\n\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThis work was supported by the Joint medical scientific research project\nof Chongqing Health Commission and Science and Technology Bureau\n(2020FYYX112).\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 20718620\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: We also analyzed the amino acid sequences for the presence of drug resistance mutations according to the last update of the WHO list for the surveillance of drug resistance mutations in antiretroviral-naive patients (SDRM version 2009, http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/WHOResistanceList.html).

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences.

Studies have demonstrated TLD's efficacy as second-line, but\nlong term follow-up is limited.\n\n### Methods\n\nARTIST is a single arm, prospective, interventional study conducted in\nKhayelitsha, South Africa, which switched 62 adults with two viral loads\n(VL) \\>1000 copies/mL from tenofovir, lamivudine/emtricitabine and an\nNNRTI to TLD. We report efficacy to 72 weeks and, in a post hoc\nanalysis, evaluated VL trajectories of individuals with viraemic\nepisodes.\n\n### Results\n\nVirologic suppression was 86% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 74-93), 74%\n(95% CI 61-84) and 75% (95% CI 63-86) \\<50 copies/mL, and 95%, 84% and\n77% \\<400 copies/mL at week 24, 48 and 72 respectively, with 89% (50/56)\nresistant (Stanford score ≥15) to tenofovir and/or lamivudine\npre-switch. No participants developed integrase-inhibitor resistance. Of\nthe 20 participants not suppressed at week 24 and/or 48, two developed\nvirologic failure, one switched regimen (adverse event), two were lost\nto follow-up, one missed the visit, one transferred out, nine\nresuppressed \\<50 copies/mL with enhanced adherence counselling and four\nremained viraemic (three with \\<200 copies/mL) at week 72.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nRecycling NRTIs with dolutegravir was effective for most participants to\n72 weeks. Most with viraemia did not develop virologic failure and\nsubsequently suppressed with enhanced adherence counselling or continued\nto have low-level viraemia. No integrase-inhibitor resistance was\ndetected despite low-level viraemia in a minority of participants.\n\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study design\n\nWe conducted a single arm, prospective, interventional study in two\nprimary care clinics in Khayelitsha, South Africa. This study was\ndesigned to evaluate the virologic efficacy of TLD in second-line ART.\n\nA full description of the study design was published with the week 24\nprimary endpoint results ^4^ . The protocol was approved by the\nUniversity of Cape Town's Human Research Ethics Committee (039/2019) and\nis available with the statistical analysis plan on ClinicalTrials.gov (\nNCT03991013 ). Adults who had virologic failure (defined as two\nconsecutive VL \\>1000 copies/mL, 2-24 months apart) on a first-line\nregimen consisting of tenofovir, XTC and efavirenz or nevirapine were\ninvited to participate. Exclusion criteria were CD4 cell count less than\n100 cells/ml, active or suspected tuberculosis, active AIDS-defining\nconditions, an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 50 ml/min\nper 1.73m ^2^ , haemoglobin less than 7.5 g/dl, alanine aminotransferase\ngreater than 100 IU/l, a previous or current diagnosis of malignancy or\nany condition judged to put the patient at increased risk if\nparticipating, a condition judged likely to impact adherence (active\npsychiatric disease or substance abuse), pregnancy, breastfeeding,\nintention to fall pregnant or unable to take the study medication\n(allergy, intolerance or contraindicated drug interaction). Women of\nchild-bearing potential were required to be on effective contraception.\n\nParticipants were enrolled and switched to TLD with additional 50 mg\ndolutegravir for two weeks to overcome efavirenz induction effects on\ndolutegravir metabolism and transport. Study visits with clinicians\noccurred every four weeks to week 24, then at week 36, 48 and 72. VL was\nassessed at baseline and every subsequent visit, with a repeat VL after\ntwo weeks of enhanced adherence counselling if VL was \\>50 copies/mL\nafter week 12. If the repeat VL was \\>500 copies/mL, a genotypic\nresistance test was performed per protocol. Baseline genotypic\nresistance testing was performed retrospectively for all participants\nand was not available to inform treatment decisions.\n\n### Outcomes and analysis\n\nThe primary outcome was VL suppression (defined as VL \\<50 copies/mL),\nevaluated according to the FDA snapshot algorithm ^16^ . We used a ±\ntwo-week visit window for the first 20 weeks, then a ± six-week visit\nwindow from week 24 onwards. The extended window was introduced to\naccommodate COVID-19 restrictions in accessing health facilities. We\nconducted a modified intention-to-treat analysis (mITT), excluding those\nswitching study drug due to contraception cessation, wishing to become\npregnant, pregnancy, non-clinical transfer out or death from non-HIV and\nnon-drug causes (assessed by the study doctor). Failure included: VL ≥50\ncopies/mL, missing VL within the visit window or loss to follow up,\nintolerance or adverse event due to any drug in the regimen requiring\nswitch.\n\nVirological failure was defined as having two consecutive VL \\>1000\ncopies/mL after week 12. Genotypic resistance was classified using the\nStanford algorithm (version 8.9-1), with a score ≥15 indicating at least\nlow-level resistance. Results were categorised as two fully active NRTIs\n(both with a Stanford score \\<15), resistance to one NRTI (one with a\nStanford score \\<15 and one ≥15) and resistance to both NRTIs (both with\na Stanford score ≥15) ^17^ .\n\nVirologic outcomes at week 24, 48 and 72 are presented as proportions\nwith the corresponding exact binomial 95% confidence interval (CI). A\npre-specified secondary analysis described VL suppression defined as\n\\<400 copies/mL. A sensitivity analysis of VL suppression excluded\ncertain participants included in the mITT analysis: those lost to\nfollow-up, missing a VL in the window and those who were changed from\nthe study drug for reasons other than treatment failure. The\npre-specified sensitivity analysis for the primary end-point of 24 weeks\nalso excluded those with evidence of poor adherence at the visit (TFV-DP\n\\<350 fmol/punch), however these results were not available for the 48\nand 72 week visits.\n\nIn a post hoc descriptive analysis, the VL trajectories of participants\nwho were on TLD and had a VL ≥50 copies/mL at weeks 24 and/or 48 were\ngraphed along with a narrative description of their baseline and\nfollow-up resistance test results, reported adherence (taken from\nclinician notes) and missed visits (no visit within the window).\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Baseline characteristics\n\nThe baseline characteristics of the 62 participants enrolled between\nAugust 2019 and July 2020, are described in Table 1 . Low, intermediate\nor high-level resistance to tenofovir, XTC or both was found in 89.3%\n(50/56 participants with results). Of these, 35.7% (20/56) had K65R\nmutations and 82.1% (46/56) had M184V/I mutations.\n\n\n### Virologic outcomes at week 24, 48 and 72\n\nThe proportion of participants with virologic suppression (VL \\<50\ncopies/mL) decreased from week 24 to week 72 but was maintained above\n70% across the mITT and sensitivity analyses. In the mITT analysis 75.4%\nof participants had a VL \\<50 copies/mL at 72 weeks. A sensitivity\nanalysis examined virologic suppression in those with a VL result who\nremained on TLD throughout the study; at 72 weeks 83.6% had a VL \\<50\ncopies/mL in this analysis ( Table 2 ).\n\n\nThe outcomes of those not suppressed at weeks 24, 48 and 72 are\ndescribed in Table 3 . At week 48, of the 16 participants not\nsuppressed, 6/16 (38%), and 6/12 on TLD with VL results, had low level\nviraemia \\<200 copies/mL. At week 72, 5/15 (33%), and 5/9 of those on\nTLD with VL results, had VL \\<200 copies/mL.\n\n### Virologic failure\n\nTwo participants met criteria for virologic failure (two consecutive VL\n\\>1000 copies/mL after week 12) during the follow up period: one at 36\nweeks and one at 52 weeks. Three participants were eligible for\nresistance testing and all three had resistance testing conducted\n(including the two participants with virological failure), but none were\nfound to have integrase resistance mutations.\n\n### Suppression by baseline NRTI resistance\n\nThe relative risk of virologic suppression for those with any baseline\nNRTI resistance (Stanford score ≥15 for tenofovir, XTC or both ^3^ )\ncompared to those with two active NRTIs at baseline was 0.84 (95% CI\n0.74-0.95) for week 24, 0.91 (95% CI 0.61-1.34) for week 48 and 0.91\n(85% CI 0.61-1.34) for week 72 (see Supplementary Figure 1 for\nproportion suppressed at each time point by baseline resistance to\ntenofovir, XTC or no resistance).\n\n### Follow up of participants not suppressed at week 24 and/or week 48\n\nNine participants were not suppressed (VL \\<50 copies/mL) at week 24 (\nTable 3 ). Following these participants forward over time, one\nparticipant developed virologic failure, four re-suppressed, two had a\nVL \\<200 copies/mL and one was lost to follow-up by week 48. One had\nalready switched from TLD before week 24 due to an adverse event (renal\nimpairment). By week 72, three of those who had re-suppressed remained\nsuppressed and one had a VL 500-999 copies/mL, one of the two with a VL\n\\<200 copies/mL remained viraemic (VL of 70 copies/mL) and one\nre-suppressed ( Supplementary Figure 2 ).\n\nWe plotted the VL trajectories for participants who were on TLD, had a\nVL conducted and had a result ≥50 copies/mL at week 24 and/or week 48.\nFigure 1 describes the VL trajectories for the seven participants who\nhad a VL ≥50 copies/mL at week 24, excluding the participant who was not\non TLD because they had switched due to an adverse event, and the\nparticipant who was classified as not suppressed due to a missing VL\nresult at week 24.\n\nFigure 1\n\nIndividual trajectories of the seven participants on tenofovir,\nlamivudine and dolutegravir with a viral load result but not suppressed\n(VL ≥50 copies/mL) at week 24\n\nOf the nine not suppressed at week 24, four were also not suppressed at\nweek 48. Sixteen participants in total were not suppressed at week 48 (\nTable 3 ). By week 72, two had developed virologic failure, seven\nre-suppressed, three had a VL \\<200 copies/mL, one had switched regimen\nand three did not have a VL at week 72 (two of these were lost to follow\nup). Figure 2 describes the VL trajectories of the nine participants who\nhad a VL ≥50 copies/mL at week 48 (excluding the five who were not\nsuppressed at week 24 as they are described in Figure 1 , and excluding\ntwo who were classified as not suppressed due to a missing VL result at\nweek 48).\n\nFigure 2\n\nIndividual trajectories of the nine participants on tenofovir,\nlamivudine and dolutegravir with a viral load result at week 48, who\nwere suppressed at week 24 but not suppressed at week 48\n\nOverall, of the 20 participants who had not been suppressed at week 24\nand/or week 48 (four at week 24 only, five at both time points, and 11\nat week 48), six had a VL ≥50 copies/mL, three were missing VL results,\none had switched due to an adverse event and ten were suppressed \\<50\ncopies/mL at week 72 ( Supplementary Figure 2 ).\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nOur study demonstrated that virologic suppression is maintained above\n70% to 72 weeks, despite almost 90% of participants having resistance to\none or more NRTI drugs at baseline. The COVID-19 pandemic restricted\naccess to facilities for many participants over the follow-up period: a\nsensitivity analysis that accounted for this and included only those on\nTLD with a VL result, also demonstrated high proportions with sustained\nvirologic suppression: 88%, 79% and 84% with VL \\<50 copies/mL and 98%,\n89% and 85% with VL \\<400 copies/mL at weeks 24, 48 and 72 respectively.\nThree quarters of the participants with episodes of viraemia\nre-suppressed to \\<50 copies/mL after enhanced adherence counselling,\nwhile two participants remained viraemic at low levels and only two went\non to meet criteria for virological failure.\n\nThe outcomes we report are similar to the NADIA trial, where 92% were\nsuppressed \\<400 copies/mL on a second-line regimen of dolutegravir or\ndarunavir with a recycled tenofovir/lamivudine backbone at 48 and 96\nweeks, and tenofovir/lamivudine was found to be superior to\nzidovudine/lamivudine at 96 weeks as a second-line backbone ^5\\ ,\\ 7^ .\nDifferences in suppression rates could be due to differences in patterns\nof adherence between the study populations. NADIA found suppression\nrates over 90% in those with no predicted NRTI activity ^5^ . We found a\nsimilar proportion suppressed in those with baseline NRTI resistance,\nand the Malawian observational study found no evidence for increased\nrisk of viraemia or virological failure for participants with baseline\nNRTI resistance ^14^ . This supports the conclusion from the NADIA trial\nthat dolutegravir in combination with a recycled NRTI backbone is an\neffective second-line regimen. Most of our participants who were not\nsuppressed had low-level viraemia (VL \\<200 copies/mL), and most of\nthese resuppressed at later time points with enhanced adherence\ncounselling. While there was little self-reported poor adherence, this\nmay be due to a social desirability bias. Those with missed visits\nreflect gaps in medication on hand, leading to poor adherence. The NADIA\ntrial also postulated that poor adherence was prevalent in their\npopulation ^5^ . We hypothesise that suboptimal adherence resulted in\nlow-level viraemia and subsequent re-suppression with improved\nadherence.\n\nDespite the substantial proportion with low-level viraemia, only two\nparticipants fulfilled the study definition of virological failure over\n72 weeks and neither of these participants (nor an additional patient\nwho qualified for genotype resistance testing) had integrase resistance\nmutations. Resistance has been identified in NADIA (three cases in the\nTLD group) ^7^ and the Malawian observational study (two cases) ^14^ .\nThe relatively low median baseline VL at switching and the small sample\nsize in ARTIST may have contributed to our finding that no patients\ndeveloped resistance to dolutegravir over 72 weeks. However, as\nresistance to dolutegravir has been shown in dolutegravir monotherapy\ntrials to generally develop between 24 and 48 weeks ^10\\ ,\\ 11^ , these\nresults are reassuring. This finding in participants using recycled\ntenofovir in the NRTI backbone, is important considering the high\nprevalence of tenofovir resistance in patients failing first-line ART in\nsub-Saharan Africa ^18^ . Cycling in and out of care with periods of\nviraemia is to be expected over a lifetime of ART ^19\\ ,\\ 20^ . Thus,\nsustaining virologic suppression over time requires a regimen that is\nrobust to the development of resistance despite fluctuating adherence.\nDolutegravir has a particularly high barrier to resistance, comparable\nto protease inhibitors and much higher than efavirenz ^21^ . Low level\nviraemia has also been shown not to be associated with subsequent\nvirologic failure in patients on a dolutegravir regimen, nearly half of\nwhom had previous virologic failure ^22^ .\n\nDolutegravir with recycled tenofovir and lamivudine seems to fulfil this\nneed for a tolerable, robust second-line regimen and could help in\nachieving the third UNAIDS target of 95% of those on treatment being\nvirologically suppressed ^23^ . Low-level viraemia at the primary\nend-point did not predict later virologic failure in participants on\nfirst-line TLD in the ADVANCE study, resulting in a recommendation that\nthe goal of treatment on dolutegravir regimens could be shifted to less\nstringent targets than a VL \\<50 copies/mL ^24^ . The low proportion of\nparticipants meeting criteria for virologic failure on TLD despite\nongoing low-level viraemia in our study seems to support this\nrecommendation.\n\nThe demonstrated efficacy of recycling tenofovir and lamivudine with\ndolutegravir in patients failing first-line NNRTI regimens in our study\nand the NADIA trial ^4\\ ,\\ 7^ addresses two key concerns facing HIV\nservices in this phase of the HIV pandemic: first, patients on\nsecond-line ART are in need of more tolerable regimens than the\ncurrently-recommended zidovudine/lamivudine/dolutegravir combination,\nand the fixed-dose, once-daily TLD provides a safe alternative to make\ntreatment more acceptable and effective for individual patients.\n\nSecond, scale up of ART is complicated by resource constraints and many\nprogrammes are opting for universal TLD regimens, frequently without VL\ntesting before switching patients due to high cost and low availability\n^25\\ ,\\ 26^ . The growing evidence from this study, the NADIA trial, and\nother studies, suggests that switching all patients on NNRTI-based first\nline to TLD regardless of VL is effective and safe, with the caveat that\nmonitoring and interventions to reduce the development of dolutegravir\nresistance should be implemented alongside widespread switching. This\napproach could facilitate less expensive and simpler strategies for\nwider TLD use ^21^ .\n\nSuboptimal adherence in a number of participants in this study did not\nresult in virological failure with the development of\nintegrase-inhibitor resistance mutations. This is compatible with\ndolutegravir's high resistance barrier, though larger numbers and longer\nfollow-up are needed to verify this. However, adherence challenges\nremain an issue regardless of regimen. While TLD represents a tolerable\nand robust second-line that may be helpful in improving adherence and\noutcomes in those who have previously failed treatment, individuals on\nthis regimen will still benefit from adherence support ^27^ . Effective\nmonitoring and management of adherence issues is required to sustain the\npopulation health benefits that TLD promises.\n\nLimitations of this study include the higher proportion of missing VL\nresults at week 48 and 72. COVID-19 reduced access to the primary care\nfacilities where the study took place, and while we widened the visit\nwindow and used telephonic follow-up to mitigate this, the pandemic may\nstill be responsible for missing VL data. Interpretation of our study is\nalso limited by the small sample size, not having a control arm and lack\nof long-term therapeutic drug monitoring. While the frequent VL\nmonitoring is not pragmatic for clinical practice, it allowed\nexploration of virologic trajectories following episodes of viraemia. A\nstrength of our study is that it was embedded within a primary care ART\nclinical service, increasing generalisability\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMost of our participants on a regimen of dolutegravir with a recycled\ntenofovir and lamivudine NRTI backbone were virologically suppressed at\n72 weeks, despite substantial baseline NRTI resistance. Most of those\nwho did not suppress had low-level viraemia or missed visits. Only two\nparticipants with raised VL developed virologic failure, and no\nparticipants were found to have developed dolutegravir resistance. With\nenhanced adherence counselling most participants re-suppressed or\ncontinued to have low-level viraemia. These findings, together with\nthose of the NADIA trial and other studies, support the routine\nswitching of all patients on tenofovir and NNRTI-based first-line\ntherapy to TLD regardless of viral load, alongside measures to mitigate\nand detect the development of dolutegravir resistance. This would\nsimplify rollout and make this effective, tolerable, and inexpensive\nregimen available to millions more patients.\n\n\n### Funding\n\nThis research was funded in whole, or in part, by the Wellcome Trust\n(212265/Z/18/Z, 214321/Z/18/Z, and 203135/Z/16/Z).

Eligible adults were enrolled between Jan 17 and May 11, 2019, at Ndunde and Milepa health centres, and between March 8 and May 11, 2019, at the Boma clinic. Viral load at the start of the TLD regimen was assessed retrospectively and measured at month 3, 6, and 12, and additionally at month 18 for those ever viraemic (viral load ≥50 copies per mL). Dolutegravir minimal plasma concentrations (Cmin) were determined for individuals with viraemia. Drug-resistance testing was done at the start of TLD regimen and at viral failure (viral load ≥50 copies per mL, followed by viral load ≥500 copies per mL; resistance defined as Stanford score ≥15).\nFindings: Of 1892 participants who transitioned to the TLD regimen, 101 (5·3%) were viraemic at TLD start. 89 of 101 had drug-resistance testing with 31 participants (34·8%) with Lys65Arg mutation, 48 (53·9%) with Met184Val/Ile, and 42 (40·4%) with lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumerate dual resistance. At month 12 (in the per-protocol population), 1725 (97·9% [95% CI 97·1–98·5]) of 1762 had viral loads of less than 50 copies per mL, including 83 (88·3% [80·0–94·0]) of 94 of those who were viraemic at baseline. At month 18, 35 (97·2% [85·5–99·9]) of 36 who were viraemic at TLD start with lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate resistance and 27 (81·8% [64·5–93·0]) of 33 of those viraemic at baseline without resistance had viral load suppression. 14 of 1838 with at least two viral load tests upon transitioning had viral failure (all with at least one dolutegravir Cmin value <640 ng/mL; active threshold), suggesting suboptimal adherence. High baseline viral load was associated with viral failure.\nRationale: The paper focuses on drug-resistance testing and viral load monitoring in patient samples but does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility assays.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 19938977\nQuestion ID: 12\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\nEvidence: Genotypic results were obtained for 88 samples (92%) from baseline and 89 samples (93%) from week 48 for the 96 participants with HIV RNA levels >1000 copies/mL at week 48. Samples with HIV-1 RNA levels >1000 copies/mL at 48 weeks and baseline samples for this subset of participants were genotyped using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and subsequent sequencing of a contiguous region of the pol gene, encompassing the whole of the protease gene and codons 1–320 of RT\nRationale: The paper mentions that genotypic results were obtained for participants with HIV RNA levels >1000 copies/mL at week 48, which indicates virological failure on the treatment regimen.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 37815035\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Methods\nParticipants were adolescents aged 12 to <18 years who weighed at least 45 kg and who were either antiretroviral (ARV)-naïve or virologically suppressed without documented resistance mutations to DOR/3TC/TDF. The efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL assessed at weeks 48 and 96 using the observed failure approach. Safety and tolerability outcomes were incidence of adverse events (AEs) and treatment discontinuations.\nResults\nA total of 45 adolescents, median age 15 (range, 12–17) years, 58% females, were enrolled and 2 (4.4%) participants were ARV naïve. Of the 45 participants, 42 (93.3%) completed the study and 41 (91.1%) completed the study treatment. At week 48, 41/42 (97.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 87.4–99.9) and week 96, 37/40 (92.5%; 95% CI, 79.6–98.4) participants had achieved or maintained HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL. There were no treatment-related discontinuations due to AEs and no drug-related AEs ≥grade 3 or deaths.\nRationale: The paper does not report in vitro drug susceptibility data. It focuses on clinical outcomes such as efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the DOR FDC treatment in adolescents with HIV-1, but does not include any in vitro drug susceptibility testing results.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 37131300\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: \"Study Population\nAdult (>18 years) TN and TE patients were included in the study. TN patients included 2 types of patients: (1) those with no previous ART (naive) and (2) those previously treated with any ART who discontinued treatment for more than a year and presented VL >1000 copies/mL (\"pseudonaive\") and no achieved resistance. Treatment-experienced patients were defined as those previously treated with any ART with suppressed pVL receiving BIC/FTC/TAF and those with unsuppressed pVL (VL >50 copies/mL) previously treated with any ART including BIC/FTC/TAF and receiving treatment with an ART (low-level replication changes, interactions). Patients with no record of baseline VL or CD4, participants in clinical trials, and patients being treated with other ART different from BIC/FTC/TAF were excluded from the study.\";\"In our cohort, we did not observe either virological failures with VL >1000 copies/mL or emergence of resistance mutations.\"\nRationale: The paper mentions that treatment-experienced patients had previously received various ARV regimens, and this cohort focuses on patients with  BIC/FTC/TAF, excluding patients treated with other ARTs. The fact that no emerging mutations were detected in the cohort suggests thaat sequencing was performed. BIC is an integrase inhibitor, FTC and TAF are both NRTIs.\nAnswer: INSTI, NRTI\n\nPMID: 34694877\nQuestion ID: 14\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?\nEvidence: At week 48 in the phase IIIb DAWNING study, the integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) dolutegravir plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors demonstrated superiority to ritonavir-boosted lopinavir in achieving virologic suppression in adults with HIV-1 who failed first-line therapy; Eligible study participants were 18 years old, had been treated with a first-line regimen consisting of 1 NNRTI plus 2 NRTIs for 6 months, and were experiencing virologic failure (HIV-1 RNA levels of 400 copies/mL on 2 consecutive visits 7 days apart) at screening.\nRationale: The paper mentions that participants had been treated with a first-line regimen consisting of 1 NNRTI plus 2 NRTIs for 6 months, and were experiencing virologic failure at screening, and had been treated with dolutegravir plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, which means sequences were from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs.\nAnswer: Yes"}

However, there are limited systematic data on comparability of\nthese methods in a clinical setting for the presence of low-abundance\ndrug resistance mutations (DRMs) and their dependency on the\nvariant-calling thresholds.\n\nMethods\n\nTo compare the HIV-DRMs detected by SS and NGS, we included participants\nenrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) with SS and NGS sequences\navailable with sample collection dates ≤7 days apart. We tested for the\npresence of HIV-DRMs and compared the agreement between SS and NGS at\ndifferent variant-calling thresholds.\n\nResults\n\nWe included 594 pairs of SS and NGS from 527 SHCS participants. Males\naccounted for 80.5% of the participants, 76.3% were ART naive at sample\ncollection and 78.1% of the sequences were subtype B. Overall, we\nobserved a good agreement (Cohen's kappa \\>0.80) for HIV-DRMs for\nvariant-calling thresholds ≥5%. We observed an increase in low-abundance\nHIV-DRMs detected at lower thresholds \\[28/417 (6.7%) at 10%--25% to\n293/812 (36.1%) at 1%--2% threshold\\]. However, such low-abundance\nHIV-DRMs were overrepresented in ART-naive participants and were in most\ncases not detected in previously sampled sequences suggesting high\nsequencing error for thresholds \\<3%.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe found high concordance between SS and NGS but also a substantial\nnumber of low-abundance HIV-DRMs detected only by NGS at lower\nvariant-calling thresholds. Our findings suggest that a substantial\nfraction of the low-abundance HIV-DRMs detected at thresholds \\<3% may\nrepresent sequencing errors and hence should not be overinterpreted in\nclinical practice.\n\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Study population\n\nOur study population consisted of people living with HIV (PLHIV)\nenrolled in the SHCS and the Zurich Primary HIV Cohort Study (ZPHI). The\nSHCS is a prospective multicentre study that is highly representative of\nthe HIV-1 epidemic in Switzerland and includes broad, in-depth and\nhigh-quality genetic, biological, clinical and demographic data.\n^\\ \\ 23^ As of August 2021, the SHCS has a cumulative total of 21 529\npatients. Plasma samples from PLHIV in the SHCS are collected twice per\nyear. The ZPHI is an observational, prospective, monocentre study at the\nUniversity Hospital Zurich started in 2002. ^\\ \\ 24^ As of August 2021,\nmore than 360 PLHIV with documented primary HIV infection had been\nenrolled in the ZPHI.\n\nThe SHCS Drug Resistance Database contains the HIV sequence data,\nprimarily partial *pol* genes, sequenced from these plasma samples using\nSS. The SwissHIVGenomeDB is maintained by the Department of Infectious\nDiseases and Hospital Epidemiology at the University Hospital Zurich; it\ncontains the HIV NGS data, predominantly (near) whole genome sequences,\nsequenced from plasma samples mostly by Illumina sequencing. SmaltAlign,\nan inbuilt pipeline in the SwissHIVGenomeDB, is developed by the\nInstitute of Medical Virology, University of Zürich, and is used to\niteratively align the reads of an NGS sequence against a given\nreference. ^\\ \\ 25^ Briefly, Illumina sample reads are read with seqtk,\n*de novo* assembly of sampled reads is performed with velvet, and\niterative alignment of NGS reads and contigs is performed with Smalt.\nSmaltAlign reports the read depth and nucleotide frequencies at each\nposition of the HIV genome for each NGS sample.\n\nTo compare the detection of HIV-DRMs by NGS and SS, we included all\nparticipants enrolled in the SHCS with SS and NGS sequences available\nfor the *pol* region of HIV and with a difference in sample collection\ndate for SS and NGS of 7 days or less (with the date requirement\nensuring that genuine differences in frequencies due to within-host\nevolution should be minimal).\n\n### Sequencing\n\nSS was performed by amplification and sequencing of HIV genomic regions\ntargeted by antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, such as the protease (PR),\nreverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN) regions. This method of\npopulation sequencing generates a single consensus sequence per sample,\nwhich represents the predominant HIV variant at each position or, using\nambiguous nucleotides, minor variants with a frequency above 20%--30%.\n^\\ \\ 26^ SS in the SHCS was performed by four laboratories using\ncommercial and in-house methods. ^\\ \\ 27^\n\nNGS sequences were generated using previously described protocols\n^\\ \\ 28\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 29^ in the context of a variety of projects ^\\ \\ 30--32^\nincluding the Bridging the Epidemiology and Evolution of HIV in Europe\n(BEEHIVE) collaboration. ^\\ \\ 33\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 34^ Briefly, the data were\ngenerated by manually extracting viral RNA from blood samples then\nreverse transcribing and amplifying the nucleic acids using primers to\ndefine four overlapping amplicons spanning the whole genome, which were\nfragmented and sequenced with Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq platforms.\n^\\ \\ 35^ The sequences of the resulting 'reads' (nucleic acid fragments)\nwere stored in the SwissHIVGenomeDB. We assembled these reads and\nobtained nucleotide frequencies at each position of the HIV genome for\neach NGS sample using the SmaltAlign pipeline. ^\\ \\ 25^ We then\nreconstructed the *pol* region of HIV genome for NGS sequences at\ndifferent variant-calling thresholds.\n\n### Quality control\n\nWe defined a 'sample pair' to be an SS and NGS sequence pair available\nfor the *pol* region of HIV for a patient enrolled in the SHCS and with\na difference in sample collection dates for SS and NGS of 7 days or\nless. In the case of multiple SS and NGS sequences available, we\nconsidered the SS sequence that covers the highest number of nucleotides\nin the *pol* region and the NGS sequence with the highest median depth.\nWe required sample pairs to meet the following criteria. First, that the\nSS sequence covered at least 250 nucleotides in the PR region, 500\nnucleotides in the RT region or 500 nucleotides in the IN region for the\nrespective region to be considered. Second, that the NGS sequence had a\nmedian depth of at least 100 reads per position. Third, we computed the\npairwise distance between the nucleotide sequence of NGS at 20%\nvariant-calling threshold and SS for each sample pair and excluded\nsample pairs with a pairwise distance ≥4.5%.\n\n### Drug resistance mutations and resistance level to ARV drugs\n\nBoth SS and NGS sequences were analysed using the Stanford HIV Drug\nResistance Database genotypic resistance interpretation program\n(Algorithm version 9.0). ^\\ \\ 36^ For NGS sequences we reconstructed the\n*pol* region at different thresholds (1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%\nand 30%). Resistance was compared either at the level of individual DRMs\nor at the level of the resistance score for the entire genotype. For the\nformer case, we defined HIV-DRMs as those mutations that confer at least\nlow-level resistance (DRM score ≥15) on their own (Table S2 ). For the\nlatter case, we considered drug resistance level interpretations for the\nARV drugs (Table S3 ). There were five predicted drug resistance\ninterpretation levels: susceptible, potential low-level resistance,\nlow-level resistance, intermediate resistance and high-level resistance.\nThese levels were used to compare the detection of drug resistance\nlevels detected by SS and NGS.\n\n### Sensitivity and additional analyses\n\nWe performed the following sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness\nand plausibility of our results. Firstly, we varied the distance\nthresholds used in the quality control. In the main analysis, we used a\nliberal threshold of DNA pairwise distance of 4.5% to select sample\npairs with high quality, because sample pairs above this threshold could\nbe due to mislabelling of a sample, technical errors in sequencing or a\nsuperinfection (infection of HIV-1-infected individuals by another viral\nstrain). We tested if the excluded samples were among potential\nsuperinfections previously identified in a systematic screen. ^\\ \\ 32^\nWe also tested our analysis at a stricter threshold of 1.5% and without\nany filtering based on DNA pairwise distance. Secondly, we assessed the\ndifference between SS and NGS in detection of HIV-DRMs for B and non-B\nsubtypes. Thirdly, we performed several analyses to assess the\nplausibility of the low-abundance DRMs detected at variant-calling\nthresholds below 10%: We assessed if PLHIV with HIV-DRMs had had prior\nART therapy with or without ARV drugs that select for the detected\nHIV-DRMs. HIV-DRMs that are detected in ART-naive PLHIV only at lower\nvariant-calling thresholds may either represent transmitted HIV-DRMs\nthat have reverted, *de novo* appearance of DRMs or sequencing\nartefacts. We assessed these possibilities by testing if these\nlow-abundance mutations were also detected in previous resistance tests\nof the same individual.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nWe compared the detection of HIV-DRMs by SS and NGS using Cohen's kappa,\na scalar metric of accuracy, as the parameter to measure the agreement.\n^\\ \\ 37^ Cohen's kappa value ranges from −1 to +1. Values closer to 1\nindicate high agreement between the measurements, whereas values near to\n0 indicate no agreement. We compared the drug resistance levels detected\nby SS and NGS (ordinal variable) using Light's kappa (the average of all\npossible combinations of bivariate kappa). We performed all analyses in\nR, version 4.1.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,\nAustria). ^\\ \\ 38^ We used the *ape* package in R to handle sequence\ndata and to compute pairwise DNA distance. ^\\ \\ 39^ We used the *psych*\npackage to compute Cohen's kappa and Light's kappa. ^\\ \\ 40^ We used the\n*boot* package to construct bootstrap CI for Light's kappa. ^\\ \\ 41^\n\n\n## Results\n\nOverall, 24 394 SS sequences and 5211 NGS (Illumina) sequences were\navailable from 21 297 PLHIV enrolled in the SHCS as of August 2021. Of\nthese PLHIV, 342 were also enrolled in the ZPHI. There were 816 paired\nsamples (at least one sequence each from SS and NGS available for the\n*pol* region of HIV and with a difference in sample collection date for\nSS and NGS of 7 days or less) from 607 PLHIV. We obtained 709 sample\npairs after restricting multiple possible sample pairs within the same\n7-day window to a single sample pair. One sample pair was excluded\nbecause only the integrase region was covered by the available SS\nsequence, 62 were excluded because the median depth of available NGS\nsequences was less than 100 reads per position, and 52 were excluded\nbecause the pairwise DNA distance between SS and NGS was ≥4.5% (Figure 1\n). To understand the impact of these sequences, we performed a\nsensitivity analysis by varying the pairwise DNA distance threshold\n(Figure S1 ) and tested the overlap with previously identified potential\nsuperinfections. ^\\ \\ 32^ After excluding sequences based on these\nquality control steps, we obtained 594 sample pairs from 527 PLHIV\n(Figure 1 ).\n\nFigure 1.\n\nSelection of study population.\n\nOpen in new tab Download slide\n\nThe majority (80.5%) of PLHIV included in our study were male (Table 1a\n). At sample collection, 20.4% of PLHIV were on ART and 76.3% were ART\nnaive. In the 594 sample pairs, 590 (99.3%) SS sequences covered the PR\nregion, 584 (98.3%) SS sequences covered the RT region, and only 19\n(3.2%) SS sequences covered the IN region of the HIV genome (Table 1b ).\nThe PR region was covered by 584 (98.3%) NGS sequences, 559 (94.1%) NGS\nsequences covered the RT region, and 559 (94.1%) NGS sequences covered\nthe IN region of the HIV genome. The majority (78.1%) of the sequences\nwere of subtype B (Table 1b ).\n\nFor each of the 594 sample pairs, we assessed the occurrence of 53 DRMs\nin the PI and RT region that confer at least low-level resistance to a\nPI, NRTI or NNRTI drug by themselves (Table S2 ). Of the 31 482\npositions screened for potential occurrences of HIV-DRMs, 28 108 were\ncovered by both NGS and SS. As expected, the number of positions with\nHIV-DRMs detected only by NGS decreased with an increase in\nvariant-calling threshold (from 427 positions at 1% to 17 positions at\n30% threshold) (Figure 2 ). Agreement (Cohen's kappa) between SS and NGS\nin detecting HIV-DRM ranged from 0.61 (95% CI: 0.58 to 0.64) at 1%\nvariant-calling threshold to 0.89 (95% CI: 0.87 to 0.91) at 30%\nthreshold (Figure 3 ). Overall, a good agreement (Cohen's kappa \\>0.80)\nwas observed for PI, NRTI and NNRTI HIV-DRMs for variant-calling\nthresholds above 5%. The variant-calling threshold yielding the\nstrongest agreement and the level of the strongest agreement varied\nacross mutations (Figure S2 ).\n\nFigure 2.\n\nHIV-DRMs detected by SS and NGS at different thresholds. INSTI-DRM were\nexcluded because only 3.2% of SS sequences covered the integrase region.\nThis figure appears in colour in the online version of *JAC* and in\nblack and white in the print version of *JAC* .\n\n\nFigure 3.\n\nAgreement between SS and NGS in detection of HIV-DRMs. Agreement is\ndefined by Cohen's kappa. A Cohen's kappa value closer to 1 indicates\nhigh agreement. The vertical bars indicate the CI of Cohen's kappas at\n1% variant-calling threshold. An HIV-DRM is any mutation of HIV genes\nconferring at least low-level resistance to PI, NRTI or NNRTI drugs by\nitself. INSTI-DRM were excluded because only 3.2% of SS sequences\ncovered the integrase region. This figure appears in colour in the\nonline version of *JAC* and in black and white in the print version of\n*JAC* .\n\nThe number of HIV-DRMs detected by NGS increased with decrease in\nvariant-calling threshold, especially at 1% (Figure 4 , Table S4a ).\nM46(ILV), T215(ACDEFILNSVY) and E138(AGKQR) were the most commonly\nobserved PI, NRTI and NNRTI-DRMs, respectively. We observed 28/417\n(6.7%) low-abundance HIV-DRMs at 10% threshold but not at 25% threshold.\nWe additionally found 31/448 (6.9%), 27/475 (5.7%), 44/519 (8.4%) and\n293/812 (36.1%) low-abundance HIV-DRMs at 5%--10%, 3%--5%, 2%--3% and\n1%--2% threshold, respectively (Table S4b ).\n\nFigure 4.\n\nNumber of HIV-DRMs detected by NGS for different variant-calling\nthresholds. The seven most prevalent HIV-DRMs for each drug class are\nshown. This figure appears in colour in the online version of *JAC* and\nin black and white in the print version of *JAC* .\n\n\nWe further assessed the resistance levels of individual ARV drugs for\neach of the 594 sample pairs. We found 166 (27.9%) of 578 SS sequences\nwith at least low-level resistance to at least one ARV drug (Table 2 ).\nAs expected, the number of NGS sequences for which we detected at least\nlow-level resistance decreased with an increase in variant-calling\nthreshold \\[from 303 (53.3%) at 1% threshold to 150 (26.4%) at 30%\nthreshold\\]. Agreement (Light's kappa) between SS and NGS in detecting\nresistance levels of a sample ranged from 0.48 (95% CI: 0.43 to 0.52) at\n1% variant-calling threshold to 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89 to 0.94) at 30%\nthreshold (Figure 5 ). Overall, a good agreement (Light's kappa \\>0.80)\nwas observed for PI, NRTI and NNRTI resistance level for variant-calling\nthreshold at or above 5% (Figure 5 ). The variant-calling threshold\nyielding the strongest agreement and the level of the strongest\nagreement varied across ARV drugs (Figure S3 ).\n\nFigure 5.\n\nAgreement between SS and NGS in detecting resistance level to ARV drugs.\nAgreement is defined by Light's kappa. A Light's kappa value closer to 1\nindicates high agreement. The vertical bars indicate the CI of Light's\nkappas at 1% variant-calling threshold. ARV denotes any PI, NRTI or\nNNRTI drug. INSTI-DRM were excluded because only 3.2% of SS sequences\ncovered the integrase region. This figure appears in colour in the\nonline version of *JAC* and in black and white in the print version of\n*JAC* .\n\nWe excluded 52 samples during quality control because the pairwise DNA\ndistance between SS and NGS was ≥4.5%. Of these 52 samples, 27 (51.9%)\nwere previously identified as potential HIV superinfection based on\nmultiple available NGS sequences. ^\\ \\ 32^ Overall we observed similar\nresults in sensitivity analyses using either a stricter threshold of\n≥1.5%, or without excluding any sequences based on the distance between\nthe NGS and SS sequences (Figure S1 ): as expected, the agreement\nbetween SS and NGS in detecting HIV-DRMs decreased in the absence of\nexclusion based on pairwise DNA distance (Figure S1 ), whereas it\nslightly increased when using a 1.5% instead of a 4.5% pairwise distance\nthreshold.\n\nWe assessed the agreement between SS and NGS in detecting HIV-DRMs for B\nand non-B subtypes. At all thresholds the agreement was lower for non-B\nsubtypes than for subtype B (Figure S4 ), especially for a\nvariant-calling threshold of 1% \\[Cohen's kappa 0.70 (95% CI:\n0.67--0.74) for subtype B versus 0.24 (95% CI: 0.21--0.28) for non-B\nsubtypes\\]. However, the difference in agreement reduced with an\nincrease in the threshold \\[at 30% variant-calling threshold: Cohen's\nkappa 0.89 (95% CI: 0.87--0.91) for subtype B versus 0.87 (95% CI:\n0.77--0.96) for non-B subtypes\\].\n\nWe further assessed the plausibility of the low-abundance DRMs detected\nat lower (≤10%) variant-calling thresholds. Of the 389 HIV-DRMs detected\nby NGS at a 25% threshold, 155 (39.8%) were detected in ART-naive PLHIV.\nOf the other 234 PLHIV, 48 (20.5%) were detected in PLHIV who received\nprior ARV drugs that do not select for the detected HIV-DRMs, and 186\n(79.5%) were detected in PLHIV who received prior ARV drugs that select\nfor the detected HIV-DRMs (Table S4 ). At a lower (≤10%) variant-calling\nthreshold, the proportion of HIV-DRMs detected in ART-naive PLHIV\nincreased and the proportion of HIV-DRMs detected in those who received\na prior ARV drug that selects for detected HIV-DRMs decreased (Table S4\n). We further assessed the plausibility of low-abundance HIV-DRMs by\nchecking whether these mutations were also detected in a previous\nsequence available for the same individual (and hence representing a\nreversion). The proportion of low-abundance HIV-DRMs detected also\ndetected at a previously available sequence decreased with decrease in\nvariant-calling thresholds \\[1/3 (33.3%) at 10%--25% to 1/60 (1.7%) at\n10%--25% threshold\\] (Table S5 ), suggesting that low-abundance HIV-DRMs\ndetected in ART-naive PLHIV, especially at very low thresholds (\\<3%),\nare less likely to be transmitted HIV-DRMs.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this study, we compared the agreement between SS and NGS in detecting\nHIV-DRMs and different resistance levels to ARV drugs. We further\nassessed the presence of low-abundance HIV-DRMs and their dependency on\nthe variant-calling thresholds. Overall, we found a good agreement\n(Cohen's kappa and Light's kappa \\>0.8) for DRMs conferring resistance\nto PIs, NRTIs and NNRTIs with variant-calling thresholds above 5%.\n\nSS typically detects HIV-DRMs present in at least 15%--25% of variants\nof circulating viruses in the plasma, ^\\ \\ 10^ whereas NGS can detect\nHIV-DRMs present even when present in lower proportions of circulating\nviruses. The lower the variant-calling threshold, the higher the number\nof low-abundance mutations detected. ^\\ \\ 9^ However, variant-calling\nthresholds \\<1% are often not considered because many of the variants at\nthis threshold may be due to errors introduced during PCR amplification\nand sequencing. ^\\ \\ 42^ Some previously established pipelines therefore\neven suggest using a threshold of 5% to minimize variants due to\nsequencing error. ^\\ \\ 16\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 43^ However, there is no clear\nevidence for thresholds between 1% and 5%. Results from a\ncross-sectional study in PLHIV in China showed a sharp increase in\nlow-abundance HIV-DRMs when the variant-calling threshold was below 5%.\n^\\ \\ 44^ Our results were in line with these previous studies.\n\nWe performed additional analysis to assess the validity of the\nlow-abundance HIV-DRMs detected at lower (≤10%) variant-calling\nthresholds. Higher proportions of low-abundance HIV-DRMs were found in\nART-naive PLHIV, particularly at 1%--2% and 2%--3% thresholds compared\nwith 3%--5%, 5%--10% and 10%--25%, suggesting that these mutations are\ntransmitted HIV-DRMs or due to sequencing error. We further assessed\nthese possibilities by testing if the low-abundance mutations were\ndetected at a higher threshold at a previous timepoint. However, such\nlow-abundance HIV-DRMs were overrepresented in ART-naive participants\nand were in most cases not detected in previously sampled sequences for\nthresholds \\<3%. These findings suggest that these low-abundance\nHIV-DRMs are less likely to be transmitted HIV-DRMs that may have\nreverted, but rather artifacts due to sequencing errors or *de novo*\nappearance, and hence these low-abundance HIV-DRMs should not be\noverinterpreted in clinical practice. We found a small yet\nnon-negligible fraction of low-abundance HIV-DRMs detected by NGS for\nthresholds between 3% and 10% whose clinical relevance warrants further\ninvestigation. Several studies have shown that such low-abundance\nmutations are associated with virological failure in PLHIV on ART,\nespecially for NNRTIs. ^\\ \\ 45--48^\n\nWe excluded sample pairs with a large pairwise DNA distance threshold to\nensure high quality. Fifty-one percent of the excluded samples were\npotential superinfections (previously described by Chaudron *et al* .\n^\\ \\ 32^ ). These were overrepresented in our initial study population\nbecause one of the projects contributing to the NGS database explicitly\naimed at sequencing such potential superinfections. ^\\ \\ 32^ These\npotential superinfections were successfully filtered out using our\nquality control because the exclusion criteria were slightly more\nencompassing than the criteria used by Chaudron *et al* . ^\\ \\ 32^ to\ndefine superinfections.\n\nOur study had several limitations. Firstly, in our study there were only\na small number of sequence pairs for which the SS sequences contained\nthe integrase region. Hence, we had to exclude INSTI-DRMs in analyses\ncomparing the overall agreement between SS and NGS. Secondly, because\nmost of the sequences of our study were of subtype B, we did not have\nstatistical power to assess the difference in agreement between SS and\nNGS in different HIV subtypes in detail. Despite these limitations, this\nstudy is the largest to systematically assess the agreement between SS\nand NGS in detecting HIV-DRMs and resistance levels to ARV drugs for the\nsequences collected in a clinical setting. Our results show a high\nagreement between SS and NGS, with NGS further detecting a substantial\nnumber of low-abundance mutations.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nWe observed, for different variant-calling thresholds above 5%, a good\nconcordance (Cohen's kappa and Light's kappa \\>0.8) between SS and NGS\nin detecting HIV-DRMs as well as for the resulting resistance levels to\nARV drugs. We observed a substantial number of low-abundance HIV-DRMs\ndetected only by NGS at lower variant-calling thresholds. Our findings\nsuggest that a substantial fraction of the low-abundance HIV-DRMs\ndetected at thresholds \\<3% may represent sequencing errors and hence\nshould not be overinterpreted in clinical practice.\n\n\n## Funding\n\nThis work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant\nnumbers 33CS30_177499 to H.F.G. in the framework of the Swiss HIV Cohort\nStudy \\[SHCS\\]; 324730B_179571 and 310030_141067 to H.F.G.; and\n324730_207957 and BSSGI0_155851 to R.D.K.); the Yvonne-Jacob Foundation\n(to H.F.G.); the University of Zurich Clinical Research Priority Program\nfor Viral Infectious Disease, the Zurich Primary HIV Infection Cohort\nStudy (to H.F.G.); and an unrestricted research grant from Gilead\nSciences (to the SHCS Research Foundation).\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 29415189\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Patients and methods\nART-naive HIV-2-infected patients with detectable plasma viral load (>100 copies/mL) included in the ANRS HIV-2 CO5 Cohort were assessed. We performed ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) of protease, RT, integrase and gp105 regions. Only mutations in the HIV-2 ANRS list >1% were considered. HIV-2 tropism was assessed by V3 loop region UDS, and each read was interpreted with determinants of CXCR4-coreceptor use.\nResults\nAmong the 47 patients assessed, three displayed plasma viruses with a resistance-associated mutation (RAM) above the 20% detection threshold, all in RT, resulting in a prevalence of transmitted drug resistance for NRTI of 7.9% (95% CI 0.0%--16.5%). No RAM above the 20% detection threshold was found in protease or integrase. At the 1% detection threshold the transmitted drug resistance prevalence was 9.8% (95% CI 0.6%--19.0%), 13.2% (95% CI 3.5%--22.9%) and 4.5% (95% CI 0%--17.5%) for PI, NRTI and integrase inhibitors. The most prevalent MRV was the PI RAM I50V detected in three samples. Tropism analysis showed that 21% of patients (4 of 19) exhibited X4-tropic viruses: two in majority proportion and two in minority proportions (1.5% and 1.9%).\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of minority resistant variants (MRV) and resistance-associated mutations (RAM) in ART-naive HIV-2-infected patients using ultra-deep sequencing (UDS). It does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 30631792\nQuestion ID: 10\nQuestion: What method was used for sequencing?\nEvidence: Sanger sequencing performed at w14 revealed the presence of M184V in RT and R263K in the integrase. We retrospectively analyzed stored samples using deep sequencing (2% cutoff): no resistance mutations were detected in the RT, protease, or integrase at baseline. Deep sequencing showed the sequential emergence of M184I (40%, w4; 42% w12; 14% w14) in RT, which began to be replaced by M184V at w12 (57%) and w14 (86%).

Pol sequences were sequenced to analyze PDR and\nconstruct a genetic network. The risk factors for PDR and the effect on\nART were respectively analyzed.\n\n### Results\n\nThe PDR of MSM in Guangxi was 4.7% (34/716), consisting of nonnucleoside\nreverse transcriptase inhibitors (3.5%), protease inhibitors (0.8%),\nintegrase strand transfer inhibitors (0.7%), and nucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitors (0.4%), and lower than that of HES (9.3%\n\\[77/827\\]). The subtype was associated with PDR, and MSM was lower than\nHES (CRF01_AE: 3.0% vs 8.0%; CRF07_BC: 4.1% vs 7.2%). CRF55_01B\n(adjusted odds ratio \\[aOR\\], 3.35) was a risk factor for PDR in MSM,\nwhile CRF08_BC (aOR, 2.34) and older (aOR, 2.75) were risk factors for\nPDR in HES. Six of 18 (33.3%) PDR of MSM in the network connected to\neach other, lower than that of HES (61.1% \\[22/36\\]). CRF55_01B (aOR,\n5.69) was a risk factor for PDR transmission in MSM, while CRF08_BC\n(aOR, 4.08) was a risk factor in HES. Pretreatment CD4 ^+^ T-cell count,\nage, infection route, and subtype were associated with recovery of CD4\n^+^ count and suppression of viral load.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThe prevalence of PDR was different between MSM and HES, which may be\nassociated with subtype. Thus, the monitoring of subtype and PDR should\nbe strengthened.\n\n\n## METHODS\n\n### Study Population\n\nIndividuals at voluntary counseling and testing centers in Guangxi from\nJanuary 2016 to December 2020 were enrolled in the study. These\nindividuals must meet the following requirements: (1) newly diagnosed\nwith HIV-1; (2) had not received ART; (3) followed the informed consent\nof participants. Peripheral blood samples and epidemiological data were\nalso collected. Plasma was separated within 12 hours of blood collection\nand stored at −80°C until further use. CD4 ^+^ T-cell count and viral\nload are the main indicators of treatment effect in the study. Blood\nsamples were collected for CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts and viral load before\nART. After treatment, the doctor told patients to come back for\nfollow-up visits: every 6 months for CD4 ^+^ T-cell count detection, and\nevery year for viral load detection, until December 2021.\n\nAccording to the previous studies, the rate of drug resistance among\npatients on ART in Guangxi was about 4.5%--7.5%. In this study, the rate\nof PDR was estimated to be 4%--10%, the standard error was 0.05, and the\nconfidence level was 0.95. According to the equation 𝑛 = 𝑧 𝛼 / 2 𝑝 ( 1 −\n𝑝 ) 𝛿 2 , the sample size was between 279 and 593. Considering that the\nsequencing failure was about 10%, 323 to 653 samples were required.\n\n### Patient Consent Statement\n\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of the Guangxi Center\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (certificate number\nGXIRB2016--0047--1). All participants provided their written informed\nconsent to participate in the study, allowing the use of demographic\ninformation and clinical records in future epidemiological studies. No\nadditional informed consent was sought and all clinical records were\nde-identified before analysis. We signed a confidentiality agreement and\nwere authorized to use the database for this study.\n\n### Testing and Sequencing\n\nThe protocols were performed in accordance with a previous study \\[ 26\n\\]. Viral RNA was extracted from the plasma samples using the QIAamp\nViral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the\nmanufacturer\\'s instructions. The target fragment of 1316 bp in the\n*pol* gene (HXB2: 2147--3462, encoding the protease and the first 299\nresidues of reverse transcriptase), which spans the reverse\ntranscriptase and protease-encoding regions, was amplified using nested\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were sent to the\ncompany for Sanger sequencing.\n\n### Subtyping and Genotypic Resistance Analysis\n\nAll sequences were edited with Sequencher v5.1 software (Genecodes, Ann\nArbor, Michigan) and aligned using BioEdit 7.1 software (Ibis\nBiosciences, Carlsbad, California) \\[ 26 \\]. Reference sequences were\ndownloaded from the Los Alamos HIV database, which included all major\nHIV-1 subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), to identify the\nsubtype of the virus gene. One hundred seventeen reference sequences\nwere included, which covered all subtypes in China. The neighbor-joining\nmethod was used to generate the phylogenetic tree based on the Kimura\n2-parameter model with 1000 bootstrap replicates using the MEGA 11.0\nsoftware ( http://www.megasoftware.net) \\[ 27 \\]. Genotypic resistance\nwas analyzed using the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database\nGenotypic Resistance Interpretation Algorithm (version 8.8) and the\nInternational Antiviral Society Drug Resistance Mutation list \\[ 16 \\].\nThe resistances included nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors\n(NRTIs), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs),\nprotease inhibitors (PIs), and integrase inhibitors (INSTIs). The\nresistance level to each antiretroviral drug was categorized as\nsusceptible, potential low-level resistance, low-level resistance,\nintermediate resistance, or high-level resistance.\n\n### Genetic Network Analysis\n\nThese aligned sequences were entered into the HyPhy software to\ncalculate their genetic distances, and Tamura-Nei93 pairwise genetic\ndistances were calculated for all pairs of sequences. Two sequences\nshowing a genetic distance of ≤1.5% were identified as potential\ntransmission partners. The network was visualized using Cytoscape v3.5.1\nsoftware. The characteristics of the network, including nodes, edges,\nand numbers of clusters, were determined.\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\nUnivariate and multivariate logistic regression was used in this study\nto analyze the risk factors associated with PDR production and\ntransmission in MSM and HES. The *t* test was used to compare the\nfrequency of PDR between PIs, NRTIs, NNRTIs, and INSTIs. The χ ^2^ test\nwas utilized to compare the effect of PDR on ART between patients with\nand without PDR. The variables included gender, age, marital status,\neducational level, ethnicity, CD4 cell counts, HIV subtype, and year of\ndiagnosis. Gender, age, marital status, educational level, and ethnicity\nwere used to adjust the odds ratio (OR) in the multivariate logistic\nregressions. *P* values \\<.05 indicate statistical significance. All\nstatistical analyses were performed using SPSS 21.0 software (IBM,\nChicago, Illinois).\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Prevalence and the Factors Associated With PDR\n\nA total of 1653 samples, including 716 MSM, 827 HES, 50 PWID, and 15\nothers, were successfully sequenced. The main subtypes in MSM were\nCRF07_BC (50.0%), CRF01_AE (27.6%), and CRF55_01B (12.6%) ( Figure 1 ).\nIn HES, the main subtypes included CRF01_AE (47.5%), CRF08_BC (21.8%),\nand CRF07_BC (21.5%) ( Figure 1 ). For all populations, the age,\nsubtype, risk factors of PDR, and prevalence of PDR differed between MSM\nand HES ( Table 1 ). Logistic regression showed that the CRF55_01B\nsubtype (adjusted OR \\[aOR\\], 3.35; *P* \\< .05) was the risk factor for\nPDR in MSM, but no significant statistical difference was observed for\nother factors. The PDR of CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, CRF55_01B, and other was\n3.0%, 4.1%, 6.5%, and 13.7%, respectively ( Supplementary Table 1 ). Age\n\\>30 years (aOR, 2.75--2.82; *P* \\< .05) and CRF08_BC subtype (aOR,\n2.34; *P* \\< .05) were the risk factors for PDR in HES. The PDR of\nCRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, and other subtypes was 8.0%, 7.2%, 16.3%,\nand 3.2%, respectively, and CRF08_BC had the highest PDR ( Supplementary\nTable 2 ).\n\nFigure 1.\n\nProportion of infection route, subtype, and pretreatment drug resistance\nin people with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. The\nmulberry figure was created with Python 3.10.1.

The PDR of PIs, NTRIs, and NNTRIs in MSM was lower than that\nin HES from 2016 to 2020 ( Figure 2  * A--C * ). The PDR in MSM\nincreased from 5.9% in 2016 to 7.0% in 2020, while that in HES varied\nfrom 9.7% in 2016 to 9.6% in 2020. The overall PDR in MSM (4.7%) was\nlower than that in HES (9.3%), and the difference was statistically\nsignificant ( Figure 2  * ​ D D * ). The main PDR in MSM was NNRTIs\n(3.5%), followed by PIs (0.8%), INSTIs (0.7%), NRTIs (0.4%), and\nmultiple mutations (0.2%). PIs mostly had moderate- and low-level\nresistance, NRTIs mainly harbored low-level resistance, and NNRTIs were\nmainly characterized by high- and low-level resistance ( Figure 3  * ​ A\nA * ). The mutations of PIs were M46I (0.4%), M46L (0.1%), L10LFIV\n(0.1%), and Q58E (0.1%) and distributed in CRF01_AE (0.3%) and CRF07_BC\n(0.3%) subtypes. The mutations in NRTIs were T215TI (0.1%), D67G/T69L_P\n(0.1%), and T215TA (0.1%) and distributed in the CRF01_AE (0.1%) and\nCRF08_BC (0.3%) subtypes. K103N (1.3%), E138EG/V179E (0.6%), and V106I\n(0.6%) were the mutations for NNRTIs and were distributed in CRF01_AE\n(0.4%), CRF07_BC (1.4%), CRF55_01B (0.8%), and B (0.8%) subtypes (\nFigure 3  * ​ B B * ). The resistance to PIs included fosamprenavir,\nnelfinavir, and tipranavir; abacavir, zidovudine, stavudine,\nemtricitabine, lamivudine (3TC), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)\nfor NRTIs; doravirine (DOR), efavirenz (EFV), etravirine, nevirapine\n(NVP), and rilpivirine for NNRTIs; and bictegravir, dolutegravir,\nelvitegravir, and raltegravir for INSTIs ( Figure 3  * ​ C C * ). The\nmutation of PIs for MSM and HES mainly involved single-drug resistance,\nwhile that of NRTIs was mainly double-drug resistance. The mutation of\nNNRTI was mainly single-, double-, and quadruple-drug resistance in MSM,\nwhile that in HES was mainly single-drug resistance ( Figure 3  * ​ D D *\n).\n\nFigure 2.\n\nComparison of protease inhibitor (PI), nucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitor (NRTI), and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor\n(NNRTI) resistance between men who have sex with men (MSM) and\nheterosexuals (HES) from 2016 to 2020.

A total of 62 clusters were\ndistributed in CRF01_AE (32/62), CRF07_BC (13/62), CRF55_01B (7/62), and\nother subtypes (10/62) in the MSM network, with mean edges of 2.28,\n5.07, 3.27, and 1.2, respectively. A total of 31 PDRs were included in\nthe genetic network, 18 from MSM and 13 from HES, which were distributed\nin CRF01_AE (5/31), CRF07_BC (14/31), CRF55_01B (7/31), and other\nsubtypes (5/31). A total of 32.3% (10/31) of PDRs demonstrated a\ntransmission relationship with each other ( Figure 4  * A--D * ). A\ntotal of 96 clusters harbored 36 PDRs in the heterosexual network, and\n61.1% (22/36) demonstrated a transmission relationship with each other (\nFigure 4  * E--H * ). The type of PDR was mainly NNTRIs in the network.\nK103N was the major mutation in the network, accounting for 39.1%,\nfollowed by E138EG, accounting for 26.1%.\n\nFigure 4.\n\nTransmission network of pretreatment drug resistance (PDR) in men who\nhave sex with men (MSM) and heterosexuals (HES).

(\n*E--H* ) Transmission network of PDR among CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC,\nand other in HES.\n\nCRF55_01B (aOR, 5.69; *P* = .05) in MSM may be associated with the\nspread of PDR, but no statistical difference was observed for other\nfactors ( Table 2 ). Univariate logistic regression showed that age\n(30--50 years: OR, 7.7, *P* = .05; \\>50 years: OR, 7.77, *P* = .048) and\nCRF08_BC (OR, 4.27, *P* \\< .001) were associated with the spread of PDR\nin HES, but multivariate logistic regression showed that only CRF08_BC\n(OR, 4.08, *P* = .001) was associated with the spread of PDR in HES (\nSupplementary Table 3 ).\n\n\n### Effect of Factors on HIV ART\n\nThe CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts and viral load from patients were collected\nfrom 2016 to 2022 after HIV ART. Nontreatment and treatment \\<6 months\nwere excluded for further analysis. The CD4 ^+^ T-cell count and viral\nload were selected as an indicator to evaluate the efficacy of\ntreatment. The CD4 ^+^ T-cell count was divided into 2 groups (\\<200,\n≥200), and viral load was also divided into 2 groups (\\<1000, ≥1000).\nThese age, gender, ethnic, infection routes, subtypes, and pretreatment\nCD4 ^+^ T-cell count and viral load variables were included in the\nanalysis. The result showed that the pretreatment CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts\n(≥200), age (\\<30), MSM, and subtype CRF07_BC were conducive to CD4 ^+^\nT-cell count recovery than other factors ( Table 3 ). For viral load\nsuppression, the pretreatment CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts (≥200), MSM, and\nsubtype CRF07_BC were more likely to suppress viral load than other\nfactors ( Table 4 ).\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThe WHO HIV drug resistance classification \\[ 28 \\] indicated that the\nprevalence of PDR in MSM (4.7%) in Guangxi was low (0--5%) but the PDR\nin HES (9.3%) was moderate (5%--15%). This finding was different from\nthat in other countries, which was \\>10.0% and higher than PWID and HES\n\\[ 2 \\]. The PDR in low- and middle-income countries significantly\nincreased in all high-risk groups, and the PDR in MSM was significantly\nhigher than that in HES and PWID \\[ 2 \\]. Reports from 2000 to 2016 in\nChina showed that the PDR in MSM was 3.6% and that in heterosexual\ntransmission was 7.3% \\[ 22 \\]. In other provinces, the PDR was 6.1% in\nBeijing \\[ 29 \\] and 3.0% in Anhui \\[ 30 \\]. Therefore, the overall\nprevalence of PDR in MSM in Guangxi was consistent with that in China.\nMany factors, including antiviral use, medication compliance, human\ngenetic background, and HIV subtypes, could influence PDR. The current\nstudy identified the relationship between subtype and PDR, which was\nconsistent with a previous study \\[ 26 \\]. CRF55_01B and B subtype\npreferred drug resistance in MSM. However, the proportion of CRF55_01B\n(12.9%) and B (2.2%) subtypes in MSM was low, which may lead to the low\nPDR level in MSM in Guangxi. Moreover, this proportion increased from\n10.9% in 2016 to 13.3% in 2020, which may contribute to the prevalence\nof PDR.\n\nSimultaneously, the complexity and diversity of HIV genotypes may be\nattributed to population flow and the spread of resistant strains \\[ 31\n\\]. In the genetic network, MSM had a more concentrated network than\nHES; 32.3% (10/31) of PDR demonstrated a transmission relationship with\neach other, and CRF55_01B subtype was the risk factor for PDR\ntransmission. In HES, 61.1% (22/36) of PDRs were related, and older and\nCRF08_BC subtypes were risk factors for PDR transmission. A previous\nstudy revealed the association of subtype and HIV transmission \\[ 32 \\].\nSurveillance of HIV genetic diversity and PDR in the region must be\nconducted, and the emergence and spread of drug-resistant strains must\nbe prevented.\n\nThe main PDR in MSM in Guangxi was NNRTIs (3.5%), followed by PIs (0.8%)\nand NRTIs (0.4%). The result was inconsistent with the national\nsurveillance report, demonstrating 1.4% for NRTIs, 1.5% for NNRTIs, and\n1.9% for PIs \\[ 22 \\], and different from the studies on 26 European\ncountries characterized by NRTIs (4.5%), NNRTIs (2.9%), and PIs (2.0%)\n\\[ 33 \\]. The WHO report revealed that the increase in global PDR was\nmainly due to NNRTI \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Therefore, the high percentage of NNRTI\nin Guangxi could lead to PDR prevalence. In MSM in Guangxi, the main\nmutation in NNRTI was K103N (36.0%), followed by E138EG/V179E (16.0%)\nand V106I (16.0%). The K103N usually caused high levels of drug\nresistance to EFV and NVP, E138EG/V179E could reduce the sensitivity of\nmost NNRTI, while V106I was only resistant to DOR. The current\ncombination of TDF, 3TC, and EFV is the first-line regimen in China.\nTherefore, the high-frequency mutations of K103N and E138EG/V179E may be\nrelated to EFV; thus, EFV should be carefully used. The resistance rate\nof DOR was relatively high in Guangxi. Studies showed an extensive\ncross-resistance between DOR and NNRTIs \\[ 8 , 9 \\]. Therefore,\npretreatment resistance and cross-resistance on DOR should be monitored.\n\nSurveillance reports showed that HIV-infected patients with PDR had a\nhigh proportion of virologic failure after ART initiation \\[ 33 , 34 \\].\nHowever, the effect of PDR on ART was rarely reported in China. On the\ncontrary, a prospective study in Japan showed that 51.2% (43/84) of\nHIV-infected patients had PI resistance mutations before ART, but no\nclinical virologic failure was observed after ART \\[ 35 \\]. Another\nstudy in Thailand also revealed that the PDR was 7.9% and M184V/I was\nonly related to poor viral suppression, which accounted for 1.5%--3.0%\nof the total mutation. However, other mutations did not affect ART.\nTherefore, the PDR could not predict the possibility of virological\nfailure in clinical treatments. The efficacy of ART is affected by many\nfactors, such as pretreatment CD4 ^+^ T-cell count and age \\[ 36 \\]. In\nthe study, we found that not only pretreatment CD4 ^+^ T-cell count and\nage, but also infection route and subtype could affect the recovery of\nCD4 ^+^ T-cell count and suppression of viral load. MSM and infection\nwith CRF07_BC have higher CD4 ^+^ T-cell count and suppression than\nothers, which may be associated with the prevalence of CRF07_BC among\nMSM population.\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe increasing coverage of first-line ART has led to an increase of the\nPDR rate among MSM, which reached the moderate level of drug resistance\nand must be taken seriously by the health department. We must continue\nto scale up PDR surveillance, including other populations and regions.\nSecond, the monitoring of subtypes should be strengthened, which could\naffect the PDR and ART.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***Financial support.*** The study was supported by the National Natural\nScience Foundation of China (grant number 82160636); the Guangxi Key\nLaboratory of AIDS Prevention Control and Translation (grant number\nZZH2020010); the Guangxi Key Laboratory of Major Infectious Disease\nPrevention and Control and Biosafety Emergency Response (21-220-12); the\nGuangxi Bagui Honor Scholarship; and the Guangxi Key Research and\nDevelopment Program (grant number Guike AB22035027).\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 35061671\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Materials and methods\nWe analyzed 1071 HIV-1 pol-gene fragment sequences (2253–3369 bp) from patients who were initiating or reinitiating first-line ART in six EECA counties, i.e., Armenia (n = 120), Azerbaijan (n = 96), Belarus (n = 158), Russia (n = 465), Tajikistan (n = 54), and Uzbekistan (n = 178), between 2017 and 2019. HIV Pretreatment DR (PDR) and drug resistance mutation (DRM) prevalence was estimated using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database. The PDR level was interpreted according to the WHO standard PDR survey protocols. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database and subsequently confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Transmission clusters were determined using Cluster Picker.\nResults\nAnalyses of HIV subtypes showed that EECA, in general, has the same HIV genetic variants of sub-subtype A6, CRF63_02A1, and subtype B, with different frequencies and representation for each country.\nThe prevalence of PDR to any drug class was 2.8% in Uzbekistan, 4.2% in Azerbaijan, 4.5% in Russia, 9.2% in Armenia, 13.9% in Belarus, and 16.7% in Tajikistan. PDR to protease inhibitors (PIs) was not detected in any country. PDR to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) was not detected among patients in Azerbaijan, and was relatively low in other countries, with the highest prevalence in Tajikistan (5.6%). The prevalence of PDR to nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was the lowest in Uzbekistan (2.8%) and reached 11.1% and 11.4% in Tajikistan and Belarus, respectively.\nGenetic transmission network analyses identified 226/1071 (21.1%) linked individuals, forming 93 transmission clusters mainly containing two or three sequences. We found that the time since HIV diagnosis in clustered patients was significantly shorter than that in unclustered patients (1.26 years vs 2.74 years).

Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences.

We determined the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity in Bulgaria during 2012--2020 using polymerase sequences from 1053 of 2010 (52.4%) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. Sequences were analyzed for DRM using the WHO HIV SDRM list implemented in the calculated population resistance tool at Stanford University. Genetic diversity was inferred using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetics. Cluster detection and characterization was performed using MicrobeTrace. The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%). Most (34/60, 56.7%) of the SDRMs were present in transmission clusters of different subtypes composed mostly of male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC), including a 14-member cluster of subtype B sequences from 12 MMSC and two males reporting heterosexual contact; 13 had the L90M PI mutation and one had the T215S NRTI SDRM. We found a low SDRM prevalence amid high HIV-1 diversity among ART-naive patients in Bulgaria during 2012--2020. The majority of SDRMs were found in transmission clusters containing MMSC, indicative of onward spread of SDRM in drug-naive individuals.

We investigated rilpivirine\ncross-resistance in treatment-naive and experienced patients in South\nAfrica. One in 10 treatment-naive patients and 74.5% of patients failing\ntreatment presented with rilpivirine DRMs. Our data suggest targeted\ngenotyping may be required for patients initiating CAB/RPV LA, which\nsignificantly complicates the currently used public health approach.\n\n\n##\n\nIn the last 25 years, remarkable progress has been made in the\ndevelopment of better and safer antiretroviral treatment (ART). However,\nsuboptimal adherence to lifelong daily oral treatment remains an\nimportant driver of virological failure and increases the risk for\ntransmission and development of drug resistance. There is currently\nconsiderable excitement in the therapeutics field at the prospect of\nlong-acting, including oral, injectable, and implantable formulations.\nOn the basis of safety and efficacy data of clinical trials \\[ 1 -- 3\n\\], long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine (CAB/RPV LA) is the first\ninjectable combination approved to treat virologically suppressed adults\nwithout history of treatment failure and with no known resistance to\neither cabotegravir or rilpivirine. Confirmed virological failure (CVF)\nin these trials was rare; therefore, a pooled analysis was performed to\nidentify baseline risk factors for virological failure \\[ 4 \\]. The\npresence of rilpivirine drug resistance mutations (DRMs), HIV-1 subtype\nA6/A1 and baseline BMI above 30 kg/m ^2^ were associated with CVF.\nAccumulation of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)\nDRMs is common in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) \\[ 5 , 6 \\];\ntherefore, predicted rilpivirine cross-resistance was investigated in a\nSouth African cohort.\n\nGenotypic sequence data from 277 patients initiating ART and 1372\npatients experiencing NNRTI-treatment failure were included for analysis\nas previously described \\[ 7 \\]. Pol sequences were submitted to\nStanford HIVdb v9.0 to identify rilpivirine DRMs. The following\nmutations were included as rilpivirine DRMs (Stanford HIVdb penalty\nscore ≥10): A98G, V100IV, K101EPH, V106I, E138AGKQR, V179DEFL,\nY181CFGISV, Y188FL, G190ACEQSTV, H221Y, F227C, and 230IL. Resistance\nprofiles were categorized as susceptible (including potential low-level\nresistance), intermediate (including low-level resistance), or\nhigh-level resistance. Subtyping was performed using the Rega HIV\nsubtyping tool v3.0.\n\nPatients initiating ART ( *n* = 277) had a median age of 34 years\n(interquartile range (IQR): 29--42) and most were women (58.8%). Two\npatients (0.6%) presented with a subtype A recombinant virus. At least\none NNRTI DRM was detected in 47 patients (17.0%), of whom 34 (12.3%)\npresented with at least one rilpivirine DRM. Twenty-seven ART initiators\n(9.7%) presented with predicted intermediate rilpivirine resistance,\nmost often caused by E138A/G ( *n* = 20) and six (2.2%) presented with\nhigh-level resistance to rilpivirine, including four with at least two\nrilpivirine DRMs.\n\nPatients failing NNRTI-based ART ( *n* = 1372) were mostly women (63.6%)\nwith a median age of 37 years (interquartile range: 31--42). Eight\npatients (0.8%) presented with a subtype A or subtype A recombinant\nvirus. Almost all patients experiencing treatment failure ( *n* = 1305;\n95.1%) presented with at least one NNRTI DRM, including 1022 (74.5%)\nwith at least one rilpivirine DRM and 516 (37.6%) with at least two\nrilpivirine DRMs. Prevalence of rilpivirine DRMs is presented in Fig. ​\nFig.1. 1 . Almost three-quarters of patients showed intermediate (28.1%;\n*n* = 385) and high-level rilpivirine resistance (44.3%; *n* = 608).\n\nFig. 1\n\nPrevalence of rilpivirine drug resistance mutations in 1372 patients\nfailing NNRTI-based treatment.\n\nCAB/RPV LA treatment, with its potential to improve treatment adherence\nand reduce stigma among other advantages, is a promising addition to the\navailable treatment arsenal \\[ 8 \\]. However, this regimen is\nrecommended in virologically suppressed patients without treatment\nfailure or suspected resistance, with the exception of isolated K103N.\nThe assessment of these conditions might be feasible in many\nresource-rich settings, wherein baseline resistance testing is the norm\nand viral load monitoring is frequently performed. An Italian study\nrecently showed that only 40% of patients in their cohort would be\neligible to switch to CAB/RPV LA, after patients with a detectable viral\nload, presence of rilpivirine, and/or integrase strand transfer\ninhibitor mutations or a positive hepatitis B surface antigen result\nwere excluded \\[ 9 \\]. Similarly, a French ART-naive cohort showed that\n10% of patients had the HIV-1 A1/A6 subtype, rilpivirine, or\ncabotegravir-associated mutations \\[ 10 \\].\n\nOur retrospective analysis indicates that rilpivirine DRMs are common in\na setting wherein NNRTI-based treatment was widely implemented. One in\n10 patients initiating ART presented with at least one rilpivirine DRM\n(12.3%). Admittedly, the prevalence of NNRTI pretreatment resistance\nwill likely lessen over time with the widespread roll-out of\ndolutegravir, which commenced in 2019 in South Africa. However, given\nthe persistence of NNRTI mutations, the large number of patients who\nhave been exposed to NNRTI-based treatment in the past, and the\ncontinued large-scale use of NNRTI-based regimens, possible transmission\nof NNRTI-resistant virus will continue for some time. Although the NADIA\ntrial demonstrated that dolutegravir-based regimens retain activity\ndespite resistance to an NRTI backbone \\[ 11 \\], this has yet to be\ndemonstrated for NNRTIs, in two-drug regimens, or for cabotegravir.\nRilpivirine cross-resistance was common in patients failing NNRTI-based\nART in our cohort with 74.5% of patients presenting with at least one\nrilpivirine mutation. As viral resuppression on NNRTI-based regimens is\nnot unusual \\[ 12 , 13 \\], the accumulation and archiving of rilpivirine\nDRMs is of concern. The prevalence of subtype A was very low in our\ncohort, which was expected in southern Africa where subtype C dominates\n\\[ 14 \\]. Although BMI data were not available in our cohort, obesity is\ncommon in South Africa with 41% of women and 11% of men having a BMI\nabove 30 kg/m ^2^ \\[ 15 , 16 \\]. Moreover, treatment emergent obesity on\nART has rapidly emerged as a clinical concern \\[ 17 , 18 \\].\n\nWe acknowledge that our resistance data are not obtained from patients\nwith a suppressed viral load, hence the prevalence of rilpivirine DRMs\nmight be an overestimation. Hermans *et al.* \\[ 13 \\] reported that\nviremia is common (19.8%) in patients treated with NNRTIs and that many\npatients (58.5%) were switched late or not at all corroborating the high\nrisk for NNRTI and possibly rilpivirine DRMs in the NNRTI-exposed\npopulation. Finally, recent modeling has indicated that the introduction\nof CAB/RPV LA would only be cost-efficient in patients with a viral load\nabove 1000 copies/ml \\[ 19 \\], for which the formulation has not been\napproved. In addition, patients with detectable viral loads are more at\nrisk of carrying rilpivirine DRMs when they have been exposed to\nNNRTI-based treatment.\n\nThis analysis indicates that rilpivirine DRMs are common in a setting\nwherein NNRTI-based treatment was recently widely implemented, and has\nsignificant implications for operational implementation of CAB/RPV LA.\nScreening for existing DRMs is logistically and technically challenging\nin LMICs and could be a barrier to use of CAB/RPV LA.\n\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nNo specific funding was received to perform this research.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 37303226\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Methods:\nWT clinical isolates (n = 6) and viruses harbouring common NRTI and NNRTI RAMs (n = 6) were serially passaged in escalating concentrations of doravirine, doravirine/islatravir, doravirine/lamivudine and rilpivirine over 24 weeks. Genotypic analysis ascertained the appearance and accumulation of NNRTI RAMs. Phenotypic drug susceptibility assays assessed resistance conferred by acquired NNRTI RAMs.\nResults:\nFor WT viruses, doravirine pressure led to the appearance of V108I or V106A/I/M RAMs after 8 weeks, conferring low-level (~2-fold) resistance. After 24 weeks, the accumulation of three to six secondary RAMs, including F227L, M230L, L234I and/or Y318, resulted in high-level (>100-fold) resistance to doravirine. Notably, viruses with these doravirine RAMs remained susceptible to rilpivirine and efavirenz. This contrasted with rilpivirine where acquisition of E138K, L100I and/or K101E resulted in >50-fold cross-resistance to all NNRTIs. Doravirine selection of viruses bearing common NRTI and NNRTI RAMs showed delayed acquisition of RAMs compared with WT virus. Pairing doravirine with islatravir or lamivudine attenuated the development of NNRTI RAMs.\";\n\"Phenotypic drug susceptibility to doravirine, rilpivirine and efavirenz was monitored using a cell-based in vitro assay as previously described. Viruses were amplified from stored cell culture supernatants at designated weeks following in vitro selection. Resistant and WT control viruses were grown in CBMCs or MT-2 cells in the presence of serial dilutions of designated NNRTIs. After 7 days, culture supernatants were collected and analyzed for RT activity. The EC 50 drug concentrations were calculated using GraphPad version 6.07 software. The fold-resistance of emergent resistant variants was ascertained relative to matching WT counterparts grown in the absence of drug.\"\nRationale: The paper describes the results of phenotypic drug susceptibility assays that assess the resistance conferred by acquired NNRTI RAMs (Resistance-Associated Mutations) after serial passaging of viruses in escalating concentrations of doravirine and other drugs over 24 weeks.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 36578581\nQuestion ID: 12\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\nEvidence: \"In 8 (4.6%) of the 174 patients with INSTI resistance, DTG was the only INSTI used in the treatment regimen.

Standard first-line regimen in Iran is comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI);  drug resistance mutations for the 3 classes of ART (NNRTI, NRTI, and PI) were observed and 4 samples showed resistance to all of them.\nRationale: The paper mentions the patients got standard treatment, and the evidence indicates the presence of mutations associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, suggesting that individuals in the study had received these drug classes prior to sample sequencing.\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI\n\nPMID: 37399555\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: Of the 2 patients with early virologic failure in the viremic group, 1 patient had a decrease in viral load less than 2 log ~10~ at the first maintenance injection (from 214 540 to 39 293 copies/mL). A nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutation (L100I) was present on genotypic testing at this time, and injections were discontinued. The patient had not chosen to initiate oral ART as of database closure, and additional genotypic testing showed a new Y181I mutation in the RT gene. Risk factors for failure were a V179V/I mutation in the RT gene at baseline and rifabutin use 2 weeks before initiation of LA CAB--RPV. The second patient with failure was also noted to have a decrease in viral load of less than 2 log ~10~ at the first maintenance injection (from 137 134 to 4371 copies/mL) and, although the HIV viral load at the third injection was less than 30 copies/mL, genotypic testing was successful and showed an E138K mutation in the RT gene and an R263K mutation in the integrase gene. The baseline genotype resistance test had a minor integrase strand transferase inhibitor (INSTI) mutation (T97A).\nRationale: The paper mentioned that patients received LA (long-acting) cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV). CAB is an integrase inhibitor and RPV is an NNRTI.\nAnswer: NNRTI, INSTI\n\nPMID: 25385110\nQuestion ID: 13\nQuestion: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\nEvidence: In vitro resistance selection of subtype B virus (MT4-green fluorescent protein [GFP] cells), as well as subtype A and C viruses (MT4-GFP/CCR5 cells) was conducted with DOR, rilpivirine (RPV), and efavirine (EFV) under low-multiplicity-of-infection conditions in a 96-well format. Resistance selection was performed with escalating concentrations of the NNRTIs ranging from the 95% effective concentration (1 × EC(95)) to 1,000 × EC(95) in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. In the resistance selection of subtype B virus with DOR, a V106A mutant virus led to two mutation pathways, followed by the emergence separately of either F227L or L234I. In the resistance selection of subtype A and C viruses, similar mutation development pathways were detected, in which a V106A or V106M mutant was also the starting virus in the pathways.\nRationale: The paper reported in vitro resistance selection of subtype B virus on DOR, RPV, EFV, becaues all viruses were from selection assay, no sequence were from HIV infected individuals.\nAnswer: Not reported"}

VLS for antiretroviral therapy (ART)\ninitiations was 92.4% (246/263), and VLS was maintained for the\nART-experienced \\[92.9% (7026/7560) pre- vs. 93.5% (7071/7560) post-DTG;\n*P* = 0.14). Among previously unsuppressed, 79.8% (426/534) achieved VLS\nwith DTG. Only 5 patients reported a Grade 3 or 4 adverse event (0.057\nper 100 patient-years) requiring DTG discontinuation. History of\nprotease inhibitor-based ART \\[odds ratio (OR) = 1.53; 95% confidence\ninterval (CI): 1.16--2.03\\], care in Tanzania (OR = 5.45; 95% CI:\n3.41--8.70), and being 15--19 years old (OR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.03--1.65)\nwere associated with gain of VLS post-DTG. Predictors of VLS on DTG\nincluded VLS before DTG (OR = 3.87; 95% CI: 3.03--4.95) and using the\nonce-daily, single tab tenofovir-lamivudine-DTG regimen (OR = 1.78; 95%\nCI: 1.43--2.22). SDS maintained VLS \\[95.9% (2032/2120) pre- vs. 95.0%\n(2014/2120) post-SDS with DTG; *P* = 0.19\\], and 83.0% (73/88) of\nunsuppressed gained VLS using SDS with DTG.\n\n### Conclusions:\n\nWe found DTG to be highly effective and safe within our cohort of CALHIV\nin LMICs. These findings can empower clinicians to prescribe DTG\nconfidently to eligible CALHIV.\n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Study Setting\n\nThe Baylor College of Medicine International Pediatric AIDS Initiative\n(BIPAI) Network consists of independent, affiliated nongovernmental\norganizations (NGOs) that provide comprehensive, patient-centered care\nto CALHIV through Centres of Excellence (COEs). Each COE partners with\nrespective Ministries of Health and is staffed by interdisciplinary\nclinical teams. A standardized electronic medical record (EMR) system is\nused across all COEs. COEs included in the study were from Botswana,\nEswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Tanzania-Mbeya, Tanzania-Mwanza and Uganda.\n\n### Study Population and Study Variables\n\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study analyzing CALHIV of 0--19\nyears old and weighing greater than or equal to 20 kg who received DTG\nas part of their HIV care between January 2017 and December 2020. The\ncohort included new ART initiations using a DTG-based ART and\nART-experienced patients who shifted to a DTG-based regimen\n(irrespective of virologic status). The rollout of DTG varied across the\nsites, with initial availability of DTG for children beginning in 2017\n(Botswana, Uganda), 2018 (Eswatini, Malawi) or 2019 (Lesotho, Tanzania).\nAcross our sites, the initial rollout of DTG for CALHIV was targeted and\nsupply-limited; however, by late 2018 and early 2019, DTG was more\nwidely available and widely used for CALHIV. Available formulations of\nDTG were the 50 mg DTG tablet or the single tab, fixed-dose combination\nof tenofovir-lamivudine-DTG (TLD), which limited the use of DTG to\nCALHIV weighing more than 20 kg. Routine and targeted HIV viral load\n(VL) monitoring was done for all CALHIV across the sites, though VL\ntesting was more limited in availability in the early years of the study\ncompared with later years. However, routine biochemistry labs were not\ncollected for CALHIV on DTG to monitor for drug toxicity. Per country\nguidelines, targeted biochemistry laboratory evaluation was only done if\nclinical concern for DTG toxicity. Assessment of ART drug resistance\nmutations via HIV genotype testing was not available as part of routine\ncare at the COEs or pre-switch to DTG. Targeted HIV genotype testing was\nonly sporadically available on a limited basis for CAHLIV failing\nsecond-line ART, and these results did not include information on DTG\nresistance. Single drug substitutions (SDS) were defined as an ART\nregimen change in which the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor\n(NRTI) backbone remained the same, and the only change was from the\nnonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI) or protease inhibitor (PI)\nto DTG.\n\nWe extracted demographic, clinical, laboratory and ART data\nretrospectively using standardized structured query language scripts\nfrom the EMR system. The data extracted included COE site, age, sex, ART\ninitiation date, ART regimen, DTG initiation date, time on ART and DTG,\nWHO clinical stage, TB history, nutrition status, VL testing dates and\nresults, HIV genotype testing availability and patient outcomes. VLS was\ndefined as VL \\< 1000 cps/mL. ^24^ Clinical and laboratory toxicities to\nDTG were extracted via the EMR and site-specific drug adverse events\n(AEs) reporting registries. AEs were graded according to the Division of\nAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse\nEvents, Corrected Version 2.1. ^25^ Data quality assurance was performed\nto ensure validity, completeness, consistency and accuracy.\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\nClinical characteristics and VLS status of participants were summarized\nusing descriptive statistics for continuous and categorical variables.\nComplete case analysis using the patient's most recent VL before\nDecember 31, 2020, was used to categorize each patient as virally\nsuppressed or unsuppressed for the comparative analysis, and those\nwithout post-DTG VL results were excluded from the VLS analyses.\nComparison of categorical variables was done using the Pearson χ ^2^\ntest and Fisher's test when appropriate. A 2-sample *t* test was used to\nassess associations in continuous variables. Age-, sex-, site- and ART\nregimen-desegregated analyses were performed on the cohort with VLS\nbeing the primary outcome of interest. Logistic regression models\nlooking at predictors of VLS as well as gain of VLS were used to produce\nodds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Complete case\nanalysis was used to assess any missingness within the regression\nmodels, and to allow the model to analyze those with complete covariate\ndata. Statistical analyses were conducted using RStudio (Version\n1.3.959, 2020, Integrated Development for R. RStudio, PBC, Boston, MA).\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Cohort Characteristics\n\nA total of 9419 CALHIV received DTG across the BIPAI COEs during the\nstudy period. This cohort represented 45.4% (9419/20,733) of all CALHIV\non ART-treated at the COEs during the study period and 60.0%\n(9419/15,698) of all CALHIV on ART weighing 20 kg or more. The majority\nof CALHIV were shifted from NNRTI-based regimen, used a TLD formulation,\nwere 50.9% female, had median age of 14.1 years and had median follow-up\ntime post-DTG of nearly 1 year (Table ​ (Table1). 1 ). By study end,\n96.7% (9107/9419) remained active in care, 0.1% (13/9107) were\ntransferred out, 2.4% (227/9419) were lost to follow-up and 0.8%\n(72/9419) died. The average number of HIV genotype results per year per\nCOE was 12 (range, 0--30), with no DTG resistance testing.\n\n\n### Effectiveness of DTG Among CALHIV\n\nOverall, 8921 CALHIV had a documented VL pre-DTG, of which 92.7%\n(8273/8921) had VLS, and a total of 7898 CALHIV with a documented VL\nafter receiving DTG, of which 93.4% (7378/7898) had VLS ( *P* = 0.14).\nUsing a cutoff of VL \\< 400 cps/mL, 90.9% (8110/8921) of the overall\ncohort pre-DTG and 91.7% (7245/7898) post-DTG achieved VL \\< 400 cps/mL\n( *P* = 0.07). Among new ART initiations with DTG with VL results (n =\n263), 92.4% (243/263) achieved VLS. Analysis of only those with\ndocumented pre- and post-DTG VL (N = 7560) showed VLS rates maintained\nfrom 92.9% (7026/7560) pre-DTG to 93.5% (7071/7560) post-DTG ( *P* =\n0.14), as well as at the VL \\< 400 cp/mL cutoff from 91.1% (6890/7560)\npre-DTG to 91.8% (6942/7560) post-DTG ( *P* = 0.32). VLS was maintained\nin 94.5% (6645/7026) of previously suppressed CALHIV following shifting\nto DTG-based ART. There were 79.8% (426/534) of previously unsuppressed\nCALHIV who achieved VLS using DTG. The following characteristics were\nassociated with gain of VLS post-DTG among previously unsuppressed\nCALHIV: having used a PI-based prior ART regimen (OR = 1.53; 95% CI:\n1.16--2.03), receiving care in Tanzania (OR = 5.45; 95% CI: 3.41--8.70),\nand being 15--19 years old (OR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.03--1.65) (Table ​\n(Table2). 2 ). All subgroups of previously unsuppressed CALHIV showed\ngains in VLS after shifting to DTG (Table 1, Supplemental Digital\nContent 1, http://links.lww.com/INF/E955 ).\n\n### Safety of DTG in Clinical Practice Among CALHIV\n\nOnly 0.07% (7/9419) of CALHIV on DTG reported a toxicity after receiving\nDTG requiring discontinuation of DTG. Among those 7 patients, 28.6%\n(2/7) experienced a Grade 1 or 2 mild AE (1 with rash and 1 with\ndizziness) and 71.4% (5/7) -- or 0.05% of all CALHIV on DTG --\nexperienced a Grade 3 or 4 serious AE (4 with hepatotoxicity and 1 with\nsomnolence) (Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content 2,\nhttp://links.lww.com/INF/E956 ). The cohort had 8818 patient-years of\nobservation, and an exposure-adjusted incidence rate for any AE, as well\nas for grade 3 or 4 AEs only, causing discontinuation of DTG of 0.079 (7\nevents in 8818 patient-years) and 0.057 (5 events in 8816 patient-years)\nper 100 patient-years, respectively. Among the 4 patients with recorded\nhepatotoxicity after initiating DTG, all were Grade 4 in severity, none\nhad any known preexisting comorbidities and 3 of the 4 had full recovery\nof their symptoms following discontinuation of DTG. One patient\n(14-year-old male on ART for 9 years, fully suppressed) was transitioned\nto DTG and started isoniazid preventative therapy on the same visit date\nand developed hepatotoxicity, jaundice, nonbloody diarrhea, seizures and\naltered mental status 2 weeks later. He was hospitalized at a local\nfacility and died after 2 additional weeks in the hospital with the\ncause of death recorded as hepatic encephalopathy by the non-COE\nhospital team.\n\n### Predictors of VLS Among CALHIV Using DTG-Based ART\n\nLogistic regression models found that being virally suppressed before\nshifting to DTG-based regimen (OR = 3.87; 95% CI: 3.03--4.95) and using\nthe once-daily, single tab TLD regimen (OR = 1.78; 95% CI: 1.43--2.22)\nwere predictors of VLS among CALHIV using DTG, whereas each increase in\na year of age slightly decreased the odds of gaining VLS (OR = 0.94; 95%\nCI: 0.91--0.97) (Table ​ (Table3). 3 ). No statistically significant\ndifferences in VLS were seen based on sex, average time on ART before\nDTG, malnutrition status or history of TB disease.\n\n\n### Effectiveness of SDS With DTG in CALHIV\n\nA total of 2665 CALHIV, or 28.2% (2665/9419) of the total DTG cohort,\nreceived DTG through SDS. The NRTI backbone in the SDS was\nabacavir-based in 44.4% (1180/2665), tenofovir-based in 38.9%\n(1032/2665) and zidovudine-based in 16.7% (443/2665). Among the SDS\ncohort with pre- and post-DTG VLs results (n = 2120), VLS was maintained\nusing SDS, with no statistically significant loss of VLS overall \\[95.9%\n(2032/2120) vs. 95.0% (2014/2120); *P* = 0.19\\]. Logistic regression\nmodels for gain of VLS among the previously unsuppressed SDS cohort\nshowed heterogeneity across geographic sites, but no significant\ndifferences based on NRTI backbone, pre-DTG ART anchor drug (ie, NNRTI\nvs. PI), or age or sex (Table ​ (Table4). 4 ). There were 83.0% (73/88)\nof previously unsuppressed CALHIV who gained VLS after SDS with DTG\n(Table 3, Supplemental Digital Content 3, http://links.lww.com/INF/E957\n). Similarly, being virally suppressed before SDS with DTG (OR = 3.16;\n95% CI: 1.68--5.94) and using the once-daily, single tab TLD regimen (OR\n= 2.02; 95% CI: 1.27--3.19) were again predictors of VLS among SDS with\nDTG CALHIV cohort, whereas younger CAHLIV utilizing SDS with DTG were\nless likely to achieve VLS compared with their older counterparts (OR =\n0.90; 95% CI: 0.84--0.96) (Table ​ (Table5 5 ).\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nWe present one of the largest real-world analyses of the effectiveness\nand safety of DTG use in CALHIV living in eastern and southern Africa,\ncovering a 4-year period that included 9419 CALHIV and 8818\npatient-years. Overall, DTG was extremely effective, with 93.4%\n(7378/7898) of CALHIV achieving VLS, and only 0.8% (72/9419) of the\ncohort experiencing death. Impressive VLS rates were seen for ART-naïve\nand ART-experienced patients, as well as across sites, age groups and\nsexes. Not only were high VLS rates maintained among those previously\nvirally suppressed on non-DTG regimens, but remarkably, nearly 80% of\nCALHIV who were unsuppressed on a non-DTG regimen -- despite the best,\nmost intensive treatment and adherence support efforts -- were able to\nbecome virally suppressed after switching to a DTG regimen, though\nheterogeneity across sites was seen. This highlights how the simple\nintervention of optimizing a child's or adolescent's ART with a high\npotency, well-tolerated anchor drug like DTG was able to achieve\ntreatment success where a multitude of time- and resource-intensive\npsychosocial interventions could not. In our cohort, DTG was found to be\nparticularly effective for achieving VLS when used as the single pill,\nonce-daily TLD formulation as well as when used as SDS (95.0% achieving\nVLS), including those without VLS before shifting to SDS with DTG.\nEqually important, DTG was found to be very safe in our cohort, with\nonly 5 patients experiencing a Grade 3 or 4 AE requiring DTG\ndiscontinuation (0.057 per 100 patient-years), only 7 patients total\nwith any AEs requiring DTG discontinuation during the study period\n(0.079 per 100 patient-years), and only 1 of the AE patients\nexperiencing death.\n\nOur findings of 91.7% of CALHIV using DTG having VL \\< 400 cps/mL were\nsimilar to clinical trial findings of both the IMPAACT P1093 study where\n74% of 12--18 years old achieved VL \\< 400 cps/mL at 48 weeks ^26^ and\nthe ODYSSEY (PENTA 20) study ^19^ where 89% of 2--18 years old achieved\nVL \\< 400 cps/mL at 96 weeks. It also compared favorably to multiple HIC\nsettings where VLS rates among CALHIV on DTG varied from 66% ^27^ to 74%\n^22^ to 88%. ^21^ The treatment success of DTG experienced by our cohort\nwas encouraging as all too often CALHIV in LMICs have limited access to\nnew, optimal ART formulations, ^28^ missed opportunities for regimen\nswitching, ^29^ and remain disproportionally disadvantaged compared with\nadult or HIC counterparts. Our cohort is a strong reminder of the\ntreatment success that can be achieved in CALHIV with timely,\nwidespread, and sustained use of DTG in CALHIV in LMICs.\n\nThe impressive safety profile of DTG and low incidence of serious AEs\nseen within our cohort adds to the growing consensus that DTG is\nextremely safe for use in children and adolescents. The favorable safety\nprofile of DTG has long been recognized in adults, ^30^ and results from\nthe ODYSSEY (PENTA 20), ^19^ IMPACT P1093 ^20^ and HIC cohorts\n^21\\ ,\\ 22^ also reported low rates of AE and discontinuations of DTG in\nchildren and adolescents. While routine laboratory monitoring was not\navailable in our cohort, serious Grade 3 or 4 AEs were only seen at a\nrate of 0.057 per 100 patient-years (5 events in 8816 patient-years) and\ncontributed to 1 death. Mild Grade 1 or 2 AEs were an infrequent cause\nof discontinuation of DTG, likely because these AEs can often be managed\nsupportively or through lifestyle changes without requiring\ndiscontinuation of DTG. For example, while weight gain in CALHIV\nreceiving DTG has recently received attention through retrospective\ncohort studies, ^31^ it was not a cause for discontinuation of DTG in\nany CALHIV in our cohort and findings from the ODYSSEY trial also\nreassuringly demonstrated that DTG-based ART was not associated with\nexcessive weight gain among children and adolescents. ^32^\n\nOur findings offer support for programmatic switching to DTG in settings\nwhere pre-switch VL or HIV resistance testing is not feasible as part of\nART optimization strategies for CALHIV. ^14\\ ,\\ 29\\ ,\\ 33^ Despite our\nsites not having routine access to HIV resistance, post-DTG VLS rates\nwere impressive at more than 90%. Similar VLS rates were observed in our\nSDS cohort and 83% (73/88) of unsuppressed CALHIV were able to achieve\nVLS with an SDS using DTG. Multiple studies have found that the presence\nof M184V/I or other NRTI resistance-associated mutations (RAM), does not\nincrease the risk of or have an impact on virological failure after\nswitching to DTG, ^34\\ --\\ 36^ including in LMIC settings. ^33^ Further,\nDTG plus lamivudine as dual therapy has demonstrated success in\nachieving VLS and cost-effectiveness in numerous studies. ^37\\ ,\\ 38^\nClinician hesitancy to changing ART can have dire consequences to\npatients, ^39^ and these findings will help to quell concerns that\npreexisting NRTI RAMs may adversely affect the ability of DTG to achieve\nVLS in CALHIV, and empower providers in LMICs to confidently switch\ntheir pediatric and adolescent patients to DTG.\n\nOur study has several limitations to consider when interpreting results.\nOur retrospective dataset was missing documented pre-DTG VLs in 5.3%\n(498/9419) and post-DTG VLs in 16.1% (1516/9419) of the cohort,\nreflecting real-world practices and challenges of VL testing in our\nsettings. It is possible that those with missing post-DTG VLs could be\nmore likely to have poor adherence, lost to follow-up and/or treatment\nfailure. If CALHIV with missing VL data were more likely to be failing\ntreatment then the estimates and true treatment failure rates in our\ncohort may be higher. Our retrospective analysis also reported high VLS\nrates pre-DTG in the cohort and no difference in VLS rates pre- and\npost-DTG in the full cohort, highlighting the potential for selection\nbias. This is likely due to the adoption of DTG rollout across national\nART guidelines, which first prioritized DTG in those with VLS and new\nART initiations. Routine HIV resistance testing was also unavailable,\npreventing any conclusions about the impact of NRTI or INSTI RAMs on DTG\neffectiveness. Our analysis also did not include data on adherence or\npsychosocial determinants of adherence, which are well-known predictors\nof VLS. Despite the impressive \"regimen forgiveness\" of DTG, high levels\nof poor adherence of even the most robust ART will result in poor\ntreatment outcomes, and continued strengthening of person-centered care\nto support adherence is needed. In addition, the BIPAI network of COEs\nmay be more well-staffed, well-resourced and offer a wider array of\nservices than other HIV clinics in the region or other LMICs. Our\nfindings, therefore, may not be representative of other HIV clinics,\nparticularly when compared with more rural and under-staffed facilities.\nFinally, we were unable to assess for the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic on our cohort during 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent\nlockdown measures caused massive disruptions to medical supply chains,\nlaboratory services, public transportation, schooling, economical\nlivelihood and HIV care worldwide and within eastern and southern Africa\nand may have explained some of the heterogeneity observed across our\nstudy sites.\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nThis multicountry analysis of 9419 CALHIV treated with DTG across 6\ncountries in eastern and southern Africa demonstrated that DTG was both\nhighly effective and safe for CALHIV. DTG was effective for CALHIV in\nreal-world settings among ART-naïve and ART-experienced, virally\nsuppressed and unsuppressed, when used as an SDS, and across geographic\nsettings, age groups and sexes in CALHIV. These findings highlight the\nmany advantages of DTG to pediatric and adolescent patients, their\ncaregivers, healthcare providers and healthcare systems, and strengthen\nthe ART optimization call for \"universal DTG for CALHIV,\" especially as\nLMICs improve access to DTG and prepare to receive the 10 mg dispersible\nformulations of DTG in 2022 and beyond. Clinicians should feel empowered\nto prescribe DTG to all eligible CALHIV as one of the most effective and\nsafe ART options currently available.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 36578581\nQuestion ID: 12\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\nEvidence: \"In 8 (4.6%) of the 174 patients with INSTI resistance, DTG was the only INSTI used in the treatment regimen.

Although the primary H51Y substitution did not confer resistance against DTG or RAL (FC values of 1.25 and 0.98, respectively), consistent with previous results ( 11 ), the addition of R262K did result in low-level but significant biochemical resistance to DTG but not to RAL (FC values of 1.9 and 0.92, respectively).\"\nRationale: The paper includes in vitro drug susceptibility data, specifically examining the susceptibility of HIV-1 to dolutegravir (DTG) and raltegravir (RAL) using short-term resistance assays with TZM-bl cells.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 37258034\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: Before DTG failure, around half of the individuals were never exposed to INSTI, whereas, among those who were INSTI-experienced, individuals received mainly raltegravir and DTG.

The first patient had significant NRTI resistance prior to switching to TDF/3TC/DTG and suboptimal adherence post treatment switch. The second patient also reported suboptimal adherence and may have had sub-therapeutic drug levels of DTG due to a drug interaction between DTG and rifampicin. Known risk factors for incident drug resistance include suboptimal medication adherence, drug interactions, a high baseline VL and active opportunistic infections. A similar case from South Africa has been described, of a treatment experienced patient who developed resistance to DTG after taking DTG 50 mg once a day with rifampicin, instead of the recommended twice daily dosing.

A total of 206 participants were enrolled in the\nsurvey; 63.2% were men, 85.7% were \\>25 years of age, and 35.6% reported\nprevious exposure to antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. The prevalence of HIVDR\nto efavirenz or nevirapine was significantly higher (OR: 1.82, *p* \\<\n0.001) in adults with previous ARV drug exposure (20.3%, 95% CI:\n18.7--22.0%) compared to adults without previous ARV drug exposure\n(12.3%, 11.0--13.8%). HIVDR to any nucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors was 10.3% (9.4--11.2%). HIVDR to ritonavir-boosted protease\ninhibitors was 1.5% (1.1--2.1%); resistance to ritonavir-boosted\ndarunavir was 0.9% (0.4--2.1%) among adults without previous ARV drug\nexposure and it was not observed among adults with previous ARV drug\nexposure. Resistance to integrase inhibitors was 12.7% (11.7--13.8%),\nyet HIVDR to dolutegravir, bictegravir, and cabotegravir was not\nobserved. The high level (\\>10%) of HIVDR to efavirenz highlights the\nneed to accelerate the transition to the WHO-recommended\ndolutegravir-based ART. Access to dolutegravir-based ART should be\nprioritised for people reporting previous ARV drug exposure.\n\n\n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1. Study Design\n\nThe Ministry of Health of Uruguay implemented a cross-sectional\nnationally representative survey following the WHO-recommended methods\n\\[ 3 \\]. Twenty-two public and private clinics provided ART in Uruguay\nat the time of the survey. Eleven ART clinics were selected as survey\nsites. These clinics served 94% of all adults initiating and\nreinitiating ART in Uruguay. The excluded eleven ART clinics had less\nthan ten adults initiating and reinitiating ART per year. The sample\nsize was calculated using the WHO sample size calculator tool and\nutilised a finite population correction \\[ 8 \\]. The following\nassumptions were used to calculate the sample size: (a) a prevalence of\nHIV drug resistance to EVF or NVP of 10% among adults initiating and\nreinitiating ART, (b) an absolute precision of 5%, (c) a genotyping\nfailure rate of 20%, (d) 840 adults initiating and reinitiating ART in\n2016, (e) a proportion of previous ARV drug exposure of 25%, and (f) a\nproportion of adults initiating and reinitiating ART with regimens that\nincluded NNRTIs of 80%. Using these assumptions, the total sample size\nwas 239, and it was distributed among survey sites proportionally to the\nnumber of adults initiating or reinitiating ART at each of the eleven\nclinics selected to participate in the survey.\n\n### 2.2. Participant Enrolment\n\nAdults ≥ 18 years of age diagnosed with HIV initiating or reinitiating\nART were eligible for survey enrolment. Eligible individuals who\nprovided verbal informed consent were consecutively enrolled.\nDeidentified demographic and clinical data were abstracted from clinical\nrecords. Previous ARV drug exposure was classified as pre-exposure\nprophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, prevention of mother-to-child\ntransmission, discontinuation of prior ART, or a combination of these\nexposures.\n\n### 2.3. Laboratory Procedures\n\nWhole blood specimens were collected by venipuncture in EDTA-containing\ntubes from participants before initiating or reinitiating ART. Plasma\nwas separated within 12 h of collection; all plasma specimens were\nstored at −80 °C at the National HIV-AIDS Reference Laboratory of\nUruguay until the completion of the specimen collection period (October\n2019). Plasma specimens were shipped on dry ice to the Centre for\nResearch in Infectious Diseases of the National Institute of Respiratory\nDiseases in Mexico City, a WHO-designated regional laboratory for HIV\ndrug resistance testing.\n\nHIV RNA was extracted from 1 mL of plasma (QIAamp Viral RNA Kit; QIAGEN,\nValencia, CA, USA). *Protease* (HXB2 positions 6--99), *reverse\ntranscriptase* (HXB2 positions 1--251), and *integrase* (HXB2 positions\n1--288) HIV genes were amplified and sequenced using in-house-validated\nprotocols \\[ 9 , 10 , 11 \\]. Sanger sequencing was performed on a 3730xl\nGenetic Analyser (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Sequences were\nassembled using ReCall \\[ 12 \\], and the post-testing quality assurance\nwas carried out using the WHO/BCCfE HIVDR quality control tool \\[ 13 \\].\nThe genotyping success rate was 99.0% (204/206) for *protease* and\n*reverse transcriptase* and 99.5% (205/206) for *integrase* .\n\n### 2.4. Data Analysis\n\nFive pairs of HIV sequences with a small genetic distance (\\<0.5%) and\nwithout epidemiological link were detected. Therefore, following the\nWHO/HIV ResNet Laboratory Operational Framework \\[ 14 \\], one sequence\nwas excluded from each pair. Thus, 204 reverse transcriptase and\nprotease sequences and 205 integrase sequences were used for the\nanalysis. HIV drug resistance was predicted using the Stanford HIV drug\nresistance database (HIVdb v 8.9-1) tool \\[ 15 , 16 \\]. Sequences with a\npenalty score ≥ 15 were considered resistant to a given ARV drug. HIV\nsubtype was assigned using the REGA HIV-1 subtyping tool (v3.46) \\[ 17\n\\].\n\nWeighted statistical analysis was performed according to WHO\nrecommendations \\[ 3 \\], using STATA 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station,\nTX, USA). The weights were calculated based on the estimated eligible\npopulation and the number of individuals enrolled in each survey site.\nThe analysis of HIV drug resistance was weighted considering the\ngenotyping success rate. Odds ratios were calculated by logistic\nregression accounting for survey design and weights. Statistical\nsignificance was assessed at the 0.05 level.\n\nAn HIV transmission network analysis was performed to identify and\ncharacterise transmission clusters. Sequences were aligned by codons\nusing Mega v11 \\[ 18 \\]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the\nmaximum likelihood method based on the General Time Reversible model\nwith 1000 bootstrap repetitions, including reference sequences for HIV\nsubtypes obtained from the Los Alamos HIV Sequences Database (\nwww.hiv.lanl.gov , accessed on 2 August 2022). The trees were visualised\nand coloured in Mega v11 \\[ 18 \\]. Putative transmission links were\ndefined and resolved between individuals whose HIV sequences had a\ngenetic distance \\<1.5% using HIV-TRACE \\[ 19 \\].\n\n\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics\n\nFrom October 2018 to October 2019, 206 adults who initiated or\nreinitiated ART in Uruguay were enrolled in the survey; 63.2% (95% CI:\n62.1--64.3%) were men, and 85.7% (95% CI: 85.2--86.2%) were over 25\nyears of age ( Table 1 ). All individuals enrolled in the study had an\nHIV viral load \\>1000 copies/mL. Among those with a CD4 lymphocyte count\nresult available at the time of treatment initiation (65%), 28.9% (IC95%\n24--34.2%) had \\<200 cells/µL, 39.2% (IC95% 34.2--44.4%) had between 200\nand 500 cells/µL, and 32.0% (IC95% 27.2--37.1%) had \\>500 cells/µL. The\nproportion of individuals with CD4 lymphocyte count \\<200 cells/µL was\nsimilar among individuals who reported previous exposure to ARV drugs\n(29.0%, IC95% 24.5--33.8%) and those without previous ARV drug exposure\n(28.8%, IC95% 23.2--35.1%).\n\nThe proportion of individuals who reported previous exposure to ARV\ndrugs was 35.6% (95% CI: 34.2--37.0%). Men were less likely to have been\nexposed to ARV drugs before survey enrolment than women ( *p* \\< 0.001).\nPeople older than 25 years of age were more likely to have had previous\nARV drug exposure(s) than people 25 years of age or younger ( *p* \\<\n0.001). Prior ART for the treatment of HIV infection followed by\ntreatment interruption of \\>3 months was the most commonly reported type\nof previous ARV drug exposure (79.8%, 95% CI: 69.8--87.0%%, n/N: 58/73),\nfollowed by post-exposure prophylaxis (1.3%, 95% CI: 0.2--10.7%, n/N:\n1/73), and prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (1.3%, 95%\nCI: 0.2--10.6%%, n/N: 1/73). The type of previous exposure to ARV drugs\nwas unknown in 17.6% (95% CI: 11.3--26.4%%, n/N: 13/73) of the cases.\n\nThe most frequently observed HIV-1 subtypes were subtype B (42.0%), F1/B\nrecombinants (25.4%), and subtype F (8.3%) ( Table 2 ).\n\n\n### 3.2. HIV Drug Resistance\n\nThe prevalence of HIV drug resistance to EFV or NVP was 15.2% (95% CI:\n14.1--16.3%), 10.3% (95% CI: 9.4--11.2%) to any nucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitor, 12.7% (95% CI: 11.7--13.8%) to integrase strand\ntransfer inhibitor (INSTI), and 1.5% (95% CI: 1.1--2.1%) to boosted\nprotease inhibitors (PI/r). INSTI resistance was attributed to the\nfirst-generation INSTI (elvitegravir and raltegravir). Resistance to\ndolutegravir, bictegravir, and cabotegravir was not observed ( Table 3\n).\n\n\nThe prevalence of HIV drug resistance to EFV or NVP was significantly\nhigher (OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.53--2.16, *p* \\< 0.001) in adults with\nprevious exposure to ARV drugs (20.3%, 95% CI: 18.7--22.0%) compared to\nadults without previous exposure to ARV drugs (12.3%, 95% CI:\n11.0--13.8%) ( Table 3 ). Among people who reported previous ARV drug\nexposure, men were significantly more likely to have HIV drug resistance\nto EFV or NVP than women (OR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.15--1.96, *p* = 0.005).\n\nThe prevalence of HIV drug resistance to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate\n(TDF) was 3.1% (95% CI: 2.4--4.1%); no HIV drug resistance to\nemtricitabine (FTC) or lamivudine (3TC) was observed among adults\nwithout previous ARV drug exposure.\n\nResistance to the first-generation INSTIs was 14.9% (95% CI:\n14.1--15.6%) in adults without previous exposure to ARV drugs. In adults\nwith previous exposure to ARV drugs, resistance to first-generation\nINSTIs was 8.8% (95% CI: 6.6--11.5%). None of the people with previous\nARV drug exposure and resistance to first-generation INSTIs reported\nreceiving INSTI-based ART. The prevalence of the integrase mutation\nG163RK was 15.2% among adults without previous exposure to ARV drugs and\n8.2% among those with previous exposure to ARV drugs ( Table 4 ). This\nmutation was detected in all cases with resistance to first-generation\nINSTI. The cases in which G163KR was observed had infection with HIV-1\nsubtype F (34.6%), F1/B recombinants (34.6%), or other F recombinants\n(30.7%) ( Table 2 ).\n\n\nUnweighted proportions of sequences with non-zero penalty scores in the\nStanford HIVdb algorithm. Underscored mutations correspond to non-SDRMs\n(surveillance drug resistance mutations as defined in Bennett et al. \\[\n20 \\] and Tzou et al. \\[ 21 \\]) and may include polymorphisms. A total\nof 204 reverse transcriptase and protease sequences and 205 integrase\nsequences were available. NRTI: nucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors; NNRTI: non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors; PI:\nprotease inhibitors; INSTI: integrase strand transfer inhibitors.\n\nNNRTI-based ART regimens were the most frequently prescribed (55.1%, 95%\nCI: 54--56.1%), followed by dolutegravir (DTG)-based regimens (29.4%,\n95% CI: 28.4--30.4%), and PI/r-based regimens (11.7%, 95% CI:\n11.0--12.6%) ( Table 1 ). Among people initiating and reinitiating\nNNRTI-based ART, 15.9% (95% CI: 14.4--17.5%) had resistance to EFV or\nNVP ( Table 5 ). The prevalence of resistance to ATV/r or LPV/r was 4.8%\namong individuals initiating and reinitiating ATV/r- or LPV/r-based ART.\nAmong those initiating and reinitiating DTG-based ART, none had DTG\nresistance.\n\n\nStudy design-weighted proportion and 95% confidence interval. HIV drug\nresistance was defined as the presence of a penalty score ≥15 using the\nStanford HIVdb algorithm.

Five of the clusters corresponded to people\nwithout previous ARV drug exposure. Three groups had exclusively male\nindividuals. Four clusters were from individuals residing in Montevideo,\nand one included individuals from Montevideo and Maldonado.\n\nFigure 1\n\nPhylogenetic tree and main clusters.

The same clusters coloured\nin the tree are indicated in ( **b** ).\n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nIn Uruguay, the prevalence of HIV drug resistance to EFV and NVP was\nhigh among people initiating and reinitiating ART. As reported in other\nLatin American countries \\[ 10 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 \\], the observed\nprevalence was greater than 10%, underscoring the need to accelerate the\ntransition to the WHO-recommended DTG-based first-line ART \\[ 27 , 28\n\\]. Uruguay included DTG in the national ART guidelines in 2018.\nTherefore, at the time of the survey, DTG-based regimens were available\nin the country, but only 29.4% of those initiating and reinitiating ART\nreceived these regimens.\n\nThe prevalence of HIV drug resistance to EFV or NVP was significantly\nhigher among individuals with previous ARV drug exposure than those\nwithout ARV drug exposure. Therefore, access to DTG-based regimens\nshould be prioritised for people reporting previous exposure to ARV\ndrugs. In addition, retention in care must be improved \\[ 27 , 29 \\],\nand adequate support for treatment adherence must be provided to prevent\nHIV drug resistance among people on ART, thus minimising the risk of\ntransmission of HIV-resistant variants \\[ 27 , 29 \\].\n\nThe resistance to the first-generation INSTI in Uruguay was attributed\nto the G163KR mutation, which is polymorphic in HIV-1 subtype F \\[ 15 ,\n16 \\] and has been reported in high prevalence among BF recombinant\nvirus circulating among INSTI-naive individuals \\[ 30 \\]. Indeed, in\nUruguay, the cases with G163KR mutation were INSTI-naive and had\ninfection with subtype F, BF recombinants, or other F recombinants. The\nG163KR mutation has not been associated with HIV resistance to\nsecond-generation INSTIs. Therefore, an impact on WHO-recommended\nDTG-based ART is not expected.\n\nSeveral clusters of HIV transmission were observed in this survey,\nincluding three clusters with male individuals only. WHO recommends oral\npre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as an additional prevention choice for\nHIV-negative adults at a high risk of HIV acquisition \\[ 27 \\].\nRecommended PrEP regimens contain TDF with or without FTC or 3TC \\[ 27\n\\]. In Uruguay, among people without previous exposure to ARV drugs, the\nprevalence of HIV drug resistance to TDF was low (3.1%), and resistance\nto FTC or 3TC was not observed. These results support using these ARV\ndrugs for PrEP regimens in the country.\n\nFinally, approximately one-third of adults initiating and reinitiating\nART with CD4 lymphocyte count had less than 200 cells/µL. Therefore, it\nis relevant to strengthen the interventions for early HIV diagnosis,\nincluding self-testing, index testing, and assisted partner notification\n\\[ 31 , 32 \\], timely linkage to treatment, and retention in care \\[ 27\n\\]. In addition, comprehensive management of advanced HIV disease should\nbe provided at the healthcare facilities in the country \\[ 33 \\].\n\nA strength of the survey is that it was carried out following WHO\nrecommendations, and the results can be considered nationally\nrepresentative estimates of HIV drug resistance among adults initiating\nand reinitiating ART in Uruguay. A limitation was that previous exposure\nto ARV drugs was self-reported and may have been underreported. Another\nlimitation was that the enrolment was extended beyond the planned\n6-month period to achieve the sample size.\n\nIn conclusion, this survey generated relevant, actionable data to inform\npublic health interventions in Uruguay. First, accelerating the\ntransition to DTG-based first-line ART as the preferred option at the\nnational level, and prioritising access to this regimen for people with\nprevious exposure to ARV drugs, will be key to minimising the impact of\nHIV drug resistance on HIV epidemic control goals. Second, HIV drug\nresistance should not be considered a barrier to scale-up oral\npre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV. Third, retention in care and adequate\nsupport for ART adherence must be maximised to prevent HIV drug\nresistance. Finally, interventions are needed to ensure early HIV\ndiagnosis, timely linkage to treatment, and retention in care.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThis work was supported by funds from the Mexican Government (Programa\nPresupuestal P016; Anexo 13 del Decreto del Presupuesto de Egresos de la\nFederación), and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research\n(PJT-148621).

HIV Pretreatment DR (PDR) and drug resistance mutation (DRM) prevalence was estimated using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database. The PDR level was interpreted according to the WHO standard PDR survey protocols. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database and subsequently confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Transmission clusters were determined using Cluster Picker.\nResults\nAnalyses of HIV subtypes showed that EECA, in general, has the same HIV genetic variants of sub-subtype A6, CRF63_02A1, and subtype B, with different frequencies and representation for each country.\nThe prevalence of PDR to any drug class was 2.8% in Uzbekistan, 4.2% in Azerbaijan, 4.5% in Russia, 9.2% in Armenia, 13.9% in Belarus, and 16.7% in Tajikistan. PDR to protease inhibitors (PIs) was not detected in any country. PDR to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) was not detected among patients in Azerbaijan, and was relatively low in other countries, with the highest prevalence in Tajikistan (5.6%).

We determined the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity in Bulgaria during 2012--2020 using polymerase sequences from 1053 of 2010 (52.4%) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. Sequences were analyzed for DRM using the WHO HIV SDRM list implemented in the calculated population resistance tool at Stanford University. Genetic diversity was inferred using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetics. Cluster detection and characterization was performed using MicrobeTrace. The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%). Most (34/60, 56.7%) of the SDRMs were present in transmission clusters of different subtypes composed mostly of male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC), including a 14-member cluster of subtype B sequences from 12 MMSC and two males reporting heterosexual contact; 13 had the L90M PI mutation and one had the T215S NRTI SDRM. We found a low SDRM prevalence amid high HIV-1 diversity among ART-naive patients in Bulgaria during 2012--2020. The majority of SDRMs were found in transmission clusters containing MMSC, indicative of onward spread of SDRM in drug-naive individuals.

We determined the prevalence of integrase\ngene polymorphisms and the frequency of naturally occurring amino acid\n(aa) substitutions at positions associated with INI resistance. Dried\nblood spot (DBS) samples were obtained from one hundred and seven (107)\nHIV-1-infected children aged less than 15 years old in two West African\ncountries, Benin and Mali. All children were naïve to INI treatment, 56\nwere naïve to anti-retroviral therapy (ART), and 51 had received ART.\nGenetic sequencing of HIV integrase was successful in 75 samples. The aa\nchanges at integrase positions associated with INI resistance were\nexamined according to the Stanford HIV Genotypic Resistance database.\nThe median ages were 2.6 and 10 years for ART-naïve and -treated\nchildren, respectively. The most common subtypes observed were CRF02_AG\n(74.7%) followed by CRF06_cpx (20%). No major INI-resistance mutations\nat positions 66, 92, 121, 143, 147, 148, 155, and 263 were detected. The\nmost prevalent INI accessory resistance mutations were: L74I/M (14/75,\n18.6%) followed by E157Q (8/75, 10.6%), G163E/N/T/Q (5/75, 6.6%),\nQ95A/H/P (2/75, 2.6%), and T97A (4/75, 5.3%). Other substitutions\nobserved were M50I/L/P, H51E/P/S/Q, I72V, T112V, V201I, and T206S.\nPolymorphisms at positions which may influence the genetic barrier\nand/or drive the selection of specific INI-resistance pathways were\ndetected. However, no transmitted drug resistance (TDR) to INI was\ndetected among samples of INI-naïve patients. These findings support the\nuse of this treatment class for children with HIV-1, particularly in\nWest Africa.\n\n**Keywords:** HIV-1, polymorphism, integrase, children, resistance,\nAfrica\n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1. Patients and Sample Collection\n\nDried blood spots (DBSs) were obtained from 107 HIV-1-infected children\naged less than 15 years old living in two West African countries, Mali\nand Benin. The DBSs were collected from 51 ART-treated children with\nvirological failure, defined as having at least one viral load (VL)\n\\>1000 copies/mL, during a study conducted in Benin between 2015 and\n2016 \\[ 14 \\] and from 56 ART-naïve children, collected between 2018 and\n2020 during early diagnosis testing and follow-up in Mali. All children\nwere INI-naïve. Whatman 903 filter paper was used to collect the DBSs,\nwith 50 uL of blood being dropped into each concentric circle. The DBSs\nwere dried at ambient temperature and then sent to the Virology\nLaboratory at the Saint-Antoine Hospital (Paris, France) for sequencing.\n\n### 2.2. Genotyping and Analysis of Resistance-Associated Mutations\n\nHIV-1 RNA was extracted from the 107 DBSs using EasyMag technology as\nper the manufacturer's instructions. Target integrase regions of the\nHIV-1 were subsequently amplified by PCR after reverse-transcription\nproduction of complementary DNA (cDNA) and sequenced using the Sanger\nmethod. Genotypic-resistance testing was conducted on the integrase\ngene's target regions of HIV-1 using the ANRS ((French) National Agency\nfor Research on AIDS and Viral Hepatitis) method (\nhttp://www.hivfrenchresistance.org/ , accessed on 2 January 2023).\n\nThe primers used were: outer primers: INPS1: 5′-TAG TAG CCA GCT GTG ATA\nAAT GTC-3′ and INPR8: 5′-TTC CAT GTT CTA ATC CTC ATC CTG-3′; inner and\nsequencing primers: INPS3: 5′-GAA GCC ATG CAT GGA CAA G-3′ and INPR9:\n5′-ATC CTC ATC CTG TCT ACT TGC C-3′. The PCR conditions were as follows:\nRT-PCR step, using the RT-PCR kit Access (PROMEGA): 45′ at 45 °C, 2′ at\n95 °C, then: (30″ at 95 °C; 30″ at 50 °C; 1′ at 68 °C) × 40 cycles.\nNested PCR step, using Ampli Taq Polymerase with Gene Amp (Roche): 5′ at\n94 °C, then (30″ at 94 °C; 30″ at 55 °C (50 °C); 1′ at 72 °C) × 45\ncycles 7′ at 72 °C.\n\nSeventy-five (75) of the 107 samples were successfully sequenced,\nassembled, and aligned using Sescap and SmartGene HIV Software\n(Innovation Park, Lausanne, Switzerland). The other 32 samples could not\nbe amplified. The INI sequences, successfully analyzed from 75 DBS\nsamples, were from 31 ART-treated children with virological failure (20\nfrom Benin and 11 from Mali) and 44 ART-naïve HIV-1-infected Malian\nchildren. Positions associated with INI resistance were analyzed, and\nthe interpretation of INI resistance was performed following the\nStanford HIV resistance algorithm, version 7.0. The HIV-1 subtypes and\nCRFs were determined according to the Stanford University HIV Drug\nResistance Database HIVdb Program, latest version (\nhttps://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb , accessed on 2 January 2023), with a\nsingle integrase gene amplification. Regarding INI mutations, all\nmutations reported in the IAS and Stanford lists were considered; in\nparticular, the major INI RAMs from the latest version of Stanford's\nlist, including T66A/I/K, E92Q, G118R, E138K/A/T, G140S/A/C/R,\nY143R/C/H, S147G, Q148H/R/K, N155H, and R263K (\nhttps://hivdb.stanford.edu/ , accessed on 2 January 2023). Some uncommon\nnonpolymorphic accessory mutations, such as M50I/L/P, H51Y, and F121Y,\nalone, do not reduce INI susceptibility \\[ 15 \\]. We also analyzed 19\nnatural polymorphisms (I72V, L74I/M, T97A, T112I, A128T, E138K, Q148H,\nV151I, S153Y, S153A, M154I, N155H, K156N, E157Q, G163R, V165I, V201I,\nI203M, and T206S) \\[ 16 \\]. HIV-1 strains were defined as resistant if\nthey carried at least one major transmitted drug-resistance (TDR)\nmutation or natural polymorphism. The overall prevalence was defined as\nthe percentage of HIV-1-infected patients with any strain with a TDR\nmutation or natural polymorphism.\n\nAll sequences were submitted to GenBank and registered under accession\nnumbers OQ435656-OQ435729 .\n\n### 2.3. Data Analysis\n\nThe participant characteristics and the proportions of resistance or\npolymorphism mutations were compared between the naïve and treated\npatients. Fisher's test was used to compare categorical variables, and\nthe Wilcoxon test was used to compare continuous variables. All\nstatistical analyses were computed using STATA, version 11 (Stata\nCorporation, College Station, TX, USA). All statistical tests were\ntwo-tailed, with α = 0.05.\n\n\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. Characteristics of Study Subjects\n\nThe characteristics of the patients providing the 75 samples that were\nsuccessfully sequenced are shown in Table 1 . At enrollment, 90.3% of\nthe treated children were receiving\nnon-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimens,\nand only 9.7% received both nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase inhibitor\n(NRTI)- and PI-based regimens. INI-resistance mutations in sequenced\nsamples are shown in Table 2 .\n\n\n\n### 3.2. INI-Resistance-Associated Mutations and Natural Polymorphism Patterns\n\nNo residue substitutions of major INI RAMs at codons 66, 92, 121, 143,\n147, 148, 155, or 263 were observed in the 75 sequences. Of the 75\nsequences, 25/75, 33%, harbored at least one INI accessory polymorphism\nmutation (L74I/M, Q95A/H/P, T97A, G118V, E138Q, S153F, E157Q,\nG163E/N/T/Q, or S230N) and 48 (64%) harbored at least one polymorphism\nmutation, described as having no impact on INI sensitivity \\[ 15 , 16\n\\].\n\nAmong the detected INI accessory mutations, L74I/M was the most\nprevalent (14/75, 18%), followed by E157Q (8/75, 10.6%), G163EN/T/Q\n(5/75, 6.6%), Q95A/H/P (2/75, 2.6%), and T97A (4/75, 5.3%). The lowest\nprevalence of residue substitutions was found at codons G118V, S153F,\nand S230N, all with the same prevalence (1.3%), representing only 1 of\nthe 75 samples. The prevalence of E138Q was 2.6% (2/75) ( Figure 1 ).\nSome natural polymorphism patterns (no known impact on INI sensitivity)\nwere also observed ( Figure 2 ). The highest prevalence in this group\nwas observed at codon T206S (74, 7%), followed by T112V (62.6%), V201I\n(61/75, 81.3%), and V72I (26/75, 34.6%). Other mutations, H51E/P/S/Q and\nM50I/L/P, were found to have prevalences of 28% and 26%, respectively.\nThe prevalence of INI accessory polymorphism mutations at the described\npositions was higher in samples with ART than those without ART,\nparticularly the E157Q, E138Q, T97A, and Q95A/H/P mutations ( Figure 1\n), whereas, the presence of polymorphisms described as having no known\nimpact on INI sensitivity was higher in ART-naïve patient samples (\nFigure 2 ).\n\nFigure 1\n\nPrevalence of INI accessory polymorphism mutations at described\npositions.\n\nFigure 2\n\nPresence of polymorphism mutations described as having no known impact\non INI sensitivity (Adapted from \\[ 17 \\]).\n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nThis first report from Benin and Mali found that no major INI RAMs were\nidentified, consistent with prior studies \\[ 7 , 14 , 18 \\], further\nsupporting evidence that primary INI RAMs are rare. This finding is\ncongruent with studies from the United States \\[ 19 \\] and Europe \\[ 20\n\\], where INI drug-resistance mutations (DRMs) have rarely been\nidentified in ART-naïve patients. The absence of major INI DRMs among\nINI-naïve patients in our study was also consistent with studies from\nother African countries, such as Zimbabwe, Uganda, Morocco, and Cameroon\n\\[ 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 \\]. However, a multi-country study from SSA,\nincluding Kenya, South Africa, Uganda, and Zambia, found a 2% prevalence\nof INI RAMs using Illumina next-generation sequencing \\[ 25 \\]. This\ndifference can be explained by the fact that our analysis was based on\nthe Sanger sequencing method, which might have underestimated the\nprevalence of INI RAMs. The Sanger method does not detect\ndrug-resistance minority variants below 20% of the virus population. The\nmost frequently reported major INI RAMs include codons T66A/I/K, E92G/Q,\nF121Y, Y143C/H/R/S, S147G, Q148H/R/K, N155H, and R263K \\[ 1 , 13 , 26\n\\], while accessory RAMs and other mutations have been largely reported\nin recent studies from SSA \\[ 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 27 \\]. The\nprevalence of both major and accessory mutations in the ART-naïve\npopulation is very low (0.5%) and likely results from cases of\ntransmitted INI resistance and the cumulative natural occurrence of\nmutations without selective drug pressure \\[ 4 , 26 , 28 \\]. Nine\naccessory INI-resistance mutations were found in this study, among which\nL74I/M, T97A, and E157Q, were identified most frequently. These\nmutations were observed in Cameroon and Ethiopia \\[ 24 , 27 \\], and\nL74M/I and M50I have been reported in the untreated population. Although\nmany reports have shown that accessory INI-resistance mutations\n(including naturally occurring polymorphisms) do not compromise the\neffectiveness of INI-based regimens \\[ 29 , 30 \\], other studies have\nrevealed that several mutations can act synergistically or additively to\ndecrease drug susceptibility \\[ 31 , 32 \\]; for instance, the\ncombination of L74M and G163R associated with T79A, has been reported by\nAbram et al. as further reducing susceptibility to RAL and/or EVG in the\nabsence of primary INI-resistance mutations. Therefore, the accessory\nINI-resistance mutations found in this study should be closely\nmonitored, as they may develop synergistic combinations. In addition,\nsome accessory INI RAMs may also pre-exist in treatment-naïve patients.\nAlthough prevalence was low, a prior study reported that prevalence can\nincrease over time and emerge in combination with nonpolymorphic\nINI-resistance mutations \\[ 26 \\]. The subtypes found in our study were\nnon-B subtypes, notably, CRF02_AG and CRF06_cpx, which are prevalent in\nWest Africa. L74M tends to be more prevalent in non-B subtypes \\[ 1 \\],\nexplaining its high prevalence in our sequenced samples. The second most\ncommon mutation was E157Q in those sequences, a polymorphic mutation\nthat was weakly selected in RAL-treated patients and in vitro with EVG.\nE157Q was the most common polymorphic accessory mutation detected in an\nEthiopian analysis, and natural polymorphisms were present in 1--10% of\nuntreated individuals, depending on the subtype \\[ 27 \\]. It has been\nshown that E157Q decreases RAL susceptibility five-fold and EVG two-fold\n\\[ 33 \\]. In addition, this mutation may increase DTG resistance because\nit may be a compensatory mutation that partially restores the enzymatic\nactivity and infectivity lost with the R263K mutation \\[ 34 \\]. However,\nno samples contained R263K in this study. This mutation was not detected\nin any non-B specimens in a Canadian study \\[ 1 \\].\n\nThe mutation T97A is a naturally occurring and lowly prevalent integrase\npolymorphism that emerges more frequently among patients carrying non-B,\nas in our setting, compared to those carrying HIV subtype B \\[ 7 , 18 ,\n29 , 33 , 35 , 36 \\]. The prevalence of T97A (5.6%) was high compared to\nprior studies \\[ 7 , 35 , 37 \\]. T97A is associated with low-level\ndecreased susceptibility to EVG and/or RAL \\[ 38 , 39 \\] and has been\ndetected in patients with virological failure and receiving INI-based\ntherapy \\[ 7 , 40 , 41 , 42 \\]. Therefore, the presence of T97A in this\nstudy suggests the need to evaluate the efficacy of INI-based treatment\nin HIV-infected patients. INI-associated polymorphic substitution of\nE157Q or L74I was identified during the IMPAACT P1093 study which\nevaluated the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of\ndolutegravir in combination with an optimized background regimen for the\ntreatment of HIV-1 in infants, children, and adolescents aged 4 weeks to\n18 years in age-defined cohorts \\[ 43 \\].\n\nSome substitutions with no known effect on INI susceptibility were also\nidentified, (V72I, T112V, V201I, T206S, Y227F, and S57N/G), with\nprevalences from 5% to 75%. Such frequencies can be attributed to\nnatural genetic variability, frequently observed in the integrase gene\n\\[ 35 , 44 \\]. The oscillation of the frequency of the unknown-effect\npolymorphism mutations may result from genetic drift \\[ 45 \\] since\nHIV-1 is subject to genetic variability. Further investigations are\nrequired to elucidate the association of these unknown mutations with\nINI-based regimens.\n\nWe have reported a higher prevalence of some accessory INI-resistance\nmutations in ART-treated samples compared to untreated samples. Indeed,\n15% of naïve patients and 11% of treated patients harbored at least one\nINI accessory polymorphism mutation at described positions. These\nprevalences were statically significant, with 38% and 17% ( *p* =\n0.0035) prevalences observed for other polymorphism mutations in naïve\nand treated patients, respectively. The presence of these mutations in\nART-treated though INI-naïve patients is conceivable, since reports have\nshown that integrase mutations increase their prevalence in ART-treated\ncompared to ART-naïve patients, suggesting that some NNRTIs, NRTIs, or\nPIs could interact (directly or indirectly) with the integrase inducing\nor selecting INI secondary mutations \\[ 29 \\]. However, the presence of\naccessory INI-resistance mutations in ART-naïve patients may also result\nfrom transmitted drug mutation, mostly acquired by children via\nmother-to-child transmission, as demonstrated with NNRTI TDR in Africa\n\\[ 7 , 46 \\]. Although naturally occurring integrase polymorphisms\ngenerally have little or no clinical effect on INI susceptibility \\[ 29\n\\], they are of concern when they evolve into major resistance\nmutations, as this could facilitate the viral evolution of resistance\nunder INI pressure \\[ 35 \\]. Indeed, INI-based therapies, according to\nWHO guidelines, are currently used, even in children. INIs, such as\nraltegravir and dolutegravir, are increasingly used in both ART-naïve\nand -treated patients in Africa. In addition, in a recent study, the\nauthors reported that the major INI-associated mutation represents a\npublic-health concern whether natural or transmitted, since it may\naffect treatment efficacy and negatively affect prognosis \\[ 13 \\]. We\nalso recommend future studies to consider the mutations in the nef\n3′-PPT region, which suggest an alternative pathway to resistance to DTG\nand other INIs \\[ 24 \\].\n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions\n\nCurrently, INI-based treatments are associated with excellent clinical\nresults in patients, leading to a healthier lifestyle and reducing the\nrisk of viral transmission. No TDR to INI was detected among the\nsequences from INI-naïve child patients. These data support using this\nclass of ARTs in West Africa, including in the pediatric population.\nHowever, continued surveillance of INI RAMs is recommended to prevent\nthe emergence of resistance to this class of drugs.\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThis specific research received no external funding.

Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

Little is\nknown about the de novo resistance pathway for DRV. We selected for\nresistance to high drug concentrations against 10 PIs and their\nstructural precursor DRV. Mutations accumulated through two pathways\n(anchored by protease mutations I50V or I84V). Small changes in the\ninhibitor P1\\'-equivalent position led to preferential use of one\npathway over the other. Changes in the inhibitor P2\\'-equivalent\nposition determined differences in potency that were retained in the\nresistant viruses and that impacted the selected mutations. Viral\nvariants from the two pathways showed differential selection of\ncompensatory mutations in Gag cleavage sites. These results reveal the\nhigh level of selective pressure that is attainable with\nfifth-generation PIs and how features of the inhibitor affect both the\nresistance pathway and the residual potency in the face of resistance.\n\n**Research organism:** Viruses\n\n## Results\n\n### Panel of highly potent and analogous HIV-1 PIs\n\nHIV-1 PIs were designed by modifications to DRV to increase favorable\ninteractions with the protease within the substrate envelope, thereby\nincreasing potency while minimizing evolution of resistance ( Nalam et\nal., 2013 ). A panel of 10 DRV analogs were chosen with enzymatic\ninhibition constants (K ~i~ ) in the single or double-digit picomolar\nrange to wild-type NL4-3 protease and the I84V and I50V/A71V\ndrug-resistant variants, respectively ( Table 1 ; Lockbaum et al., 2019\n; Mittal et al., 2013 ). These PIs contained modified P1' positions with\n(S)-2-methylbutyl or 2-ethyl-n-butyl moieties (R1-1 and R1-2,\nrespectively) in combination with five diverse P2′ phenyl-sulfonamides\n(R2-1 to R2-5), with the inhibitors named UMASS-1 through -10 ( Table 1\n). These inhibitors and DRV were also tested in a cell culture-based\nviral inhibition assay. The EC ~50~ values (the effective concentration\nneeded at the time of virus production to reduce infectivity by 50%) for\nDRV and the UMASS analogues ranged from 2.4 to 9.1 nM, significantly\nmore potent than the second- and third-generation PIs tested ( Figure\n2---figure supplement 1 ).\n\nThere are several patterns worth noting in the K ~i~ and EC ~50~ values.\nFirst, all inhibitors had a K ~i~ of less than 5 pM (limit of detection)\nagainst the wild-type enzyme, precluding a comparison of potency among\nthem without using partially resistant mutant proteases (I84V and\nI50V/A71V). Second, the P1\\'/R1 position change to the larger\n2-ethyl-n-butyl moiety (R1-2, UMASS-6) increased potency against the\nI84V mutant protease relative to DRV and the intermediate sized R1-1\nmoiety UMASS-1 (all three share the same R2-1 moiety); this enhanced\npotency of the R1-2 inhibitors over the R1-1 inhibitors was also\napparent for UMASS-8 over UMASS-3, which share the same R2-3 structure (\nTable 1 , Figure 2---figure supplement 2 ), while this pattern of\npotency was reversed (i.e., R1-1 was more potent than R1-2) for UMASS\npairs -2 and -7, and -5 and -10 (with R2-2 and R2-5, respectively;\nFigure 2---figure supplement 2 ). Third, four of the inhibitors with the\nR2 moieties R2-2 or R2-5 were significantly more potent (UMASS-2, -5,\n-7, -10) than with the other R2 moieties. This trend was most pronounced\nfor activity against the I50V/A71V mutant enzyme in both the R1-1 and\nR1-2 backgrounds ( Figure 2---figure supplement 2 ). The significant\npotency of the R2-2 and R2-5 containing inhibitors against the I50V/A71V\nmutant enzyme while maintaining good potency against the I84V enzyme\nindicates that both the R1 and R2 constituents contribute to potency,\nand to enhancing potency over DRV. This potency was also seen in\ninhibition of viral infectivity as the EC ~50~ values of the R2-2 and\nR2-5 containing inhibitors were among the lowest measured ( Table 1 ).\n\n### Selection for high-level resistance during passage in cell culture follows two pathways\n\nTo evaluate the potential of each inhibitor to select for mutations that\nwould confer high-level resistance and to compare these mutations across\nthe inhibitor series, we grew HIV-1 under conditions of escalating\ninhibitor concentration in cell culture through a lengthy period of\nselection (50--95 passages). The selection experiments were performed\nunder two separate starting conditions: first when the starting virus\nwas generated from the NL4-3 clone (this clone closely approximates the\nclade B consensus for the protease amino acid sequence and will be\nreferred to as 'wild type'), then again when the starting virus was a\nmixture of 26 isogenic viruses each with a single mutation associated\nwith drug resistance in the NL4-3 background. Notably, in the latter\ncase only about one-half of the mutations that appeared in the culture\nduring selections were in the mixture of starting mutations, indicating\nthat even in the selections that were seeded with the pool of single\nresistance mutations there was sufficient evolutionary capacity to\nexplore mutations at positions that started as the wild-type sequence.\nThe initial inhibitor concentration started at low nanomolar\nconcentrations and increased by a factor of 1.5 with each subsequent\nviral passage (the inhibitor concentration was increased only after the\nvirus spread efficiently through the culture). All of the selections\nstarting with wild-type virus reached at least 5 µM of inhibitor\nconcentration (approximating the therapeutic concentration reached by\nDRV in the blood and in the range of a 1000-fold increase in the\nstarting EC ~50~ ). For technical reasons, only five of the selections\nstarting with the mixture of mutants reached an inhibitor concentration\nas high as 400 nM and are reported here ( Figure 2---figure supplement 3\n).\n\nResistance mutations selected in the protease coding domain during the\nescalating selective pressure of increasing PI concentration were\nexamined at various timepoints using a next-generation sequencing (NGS)\nprotocol that included Primer ID with the MiSeq platform ( Zhou et al.,\n2015 ). We first examined the sequence of the most abundant variant in\neach of the two selection schemes present at the highest inhibitor\nconcentration reached ( Figure 2A ). For those selections that reached 5\nμM, 8--14 mutations were present in the most abundant variant. Typically\nthe next two most abundant variants in the population differed by a\nsingle amino acid, and on average the three most abundant variants in\nthe 5 μM cultures accounted for 88% of the total viral population (\nFigure 2---source data 1 ). Evolution of resistance followed two\npathways, one based on I50V and one based on I84V. In three cultures,\nV2wt, V5wt, and V2mut (which reached either 4 or 5 μM final drug\nconcentration; V2wt indicates the virus pool selected with UMASS-2\nstarting with wild-type virus), these two mutations, I84V and I50V,\nbecame linked on the same genome ( Figure 2A ) showing they are not\nmutually exclusive; it is worth noting that the appearance of the linked\nI84V/I50V mutations occurred in the selections of the UMASS inhibitors\n(-2 and -5) that showed the greatest potency against the two mutant\nenzymes I84V and I50V/A71V ( Table 1 , Figure 2---figure supplement 2 ),\nconsistent with inhibitor potency driving the co-selection of these two\nprimary resistance mutations together.\n\nFigure 2.\n\n**Features of viruses selected to high-level resistance against\ndarunavir (DRV) and the UMASS-1 through -10 inhibitor series.**\n\nInfected cultures were put under drug selection starting with either\nwild-type virus or a pool of mutant viruses. ( **A** ) Most abundant\nvariants present at final timepoint. Resistance mutations in the viruses\nselected starting with the wild-type virus are in blue, and the\nselection starting with the pool of mutant viruses in in red. The\nculture name indicates a virus pool (V), the UMASS PI number (V1), and\nwhether the selection started with wild-type or mutants (V1wt). PR\nsequences that were used to generate purified recombinant protease are\nindicated (e.g., PR-3wt).

Trendline is for\nvisualization purposes only. \\* p\\<0.05, \\*\\*p\\<0.01, \\*\\*\\*p\\<0.001.\n\n\nIn addition to the sequence of the terminally selected virus, we\nvalidated that selection occurred over the entire course of the\nselection protocol. First, as can be seen in Figure 2B , the number of\nmutations present at 100 nM drug concentration was approximately half\nthe number present after selection to greater than 1 μM. In comparing\nthe number of mutations present in cultures using the I84V versus the\nI50V pathway, we noted that on average there were more mutations in the\nI50V viruses at the intermediate drug concentration compared to the I84V\nviruses (100 nM, p=0.03), and this trend continued at the higher drug\nconcentration. Next we compared the EC ~50~ of five virus cultures\nrepresenting the I84V or the I50V pathways (highlighted in yellow in\nFigure 2 ), and including one that had both mutations linked, testing\nthe level of resistance to all of the UMASS-1 through -10 inhibitors\nafter selection to 100 nM drug concentration or to 5 μM. As can be seen\nin Figure 2C , resistance (measured as an increase in the EC ~50~ ) was\napparent after selection to the 100 nM inhibitor concentration, and in\neach case the EC ~50~ increased an average of 100-fold after selection\nto the final inhibitor concentration of 5 μM (EC ~50~ values of the\nfinal virus pool are shown in Table 1 ).\n\nWe were also interested in the fitness cost of these mutations. To\nmeasure this effect, we compared the infectivity of the virus in 10\nculture supernatants (five virus pools at each of two levels of\nselection), normalizing infectivity on a reporter cell line for a given\namount of the virion p24 CA protein in the culture supernatant. This was\ncompared to the unmutated NL4-3 parent (given a value of 100%). As can\nbe seen in Figure 2D , selection to 100 nM inhibitor concentration\nresulted in a reduction in fitness/relative infectivity by between 100-\nand 1000-fold. Those cultures with the biggest decrease in fitness\nrebounded to around 1% relative infectivity after selection to an\ninhibitor level of 5 μM. This suggests that these high levels of\nresistance are linked to maintaining a residual level of relative\ninfectivity around 1% (as defined under these culture conditions).\n\nWe used another approach to explore the interplay between resistance and\nfitness; we examined the effect of resistance on catalytic efficiency of\nthe protease by measuring K ~i~ and the catalytic efficiency (kcat/K ~m~\n) for a set of mutant proteases against the entire panel of UMASS\ninhibitors and DRV. The average K ~i~ value of each mutant protease\n(sequences shown in Figure 2---source data 1 ) is plotted against the\ncatalytic efficiency (kcat/K ~m~ ) for that enzyme in Figure 2E . As can\nbe seen, there is a strong relationship between higher K ~i~ values\n(i.e., resistance) and dramatic reductions in catalytic efficiency,\nconsistent with the loss of fitness associated with these viral\npopulations.\n\n### Features of the selection process assessed by NGS of longitudinal samples\n\nEach of the viral cultures started with wild-type virus showed an\naccumulation of protease mutations with increasing selective pressure.\nNGS analysis revealed very few fixed variants in the cultures started\nwith wild-type virus until the inhibitor concentration reached\napproximately 3--5 nM (approaching the EC ~50~ value for the wild-type\nvirus, Table 1 ); in contrast, the cultures that were started with the\nmutant library selected for the outgrowth of a subset of those mutants\nby 1 nM inhibitor concentration ( Figure 3A ). In all cultures, the\ntransition through the EC ~50~ concentration of the wild-type virus\nprovided significant selective pressure for fixing mutations. Multiple\nunfixed mutations were observed in each culture after the drug\nconcentration exceeded the EC ~50~ values above 3 nM, highlighting the\nhigh genetic diversity in the culture. Additional mutations became\nlinked on each viral genome at higher drug concentrations.\n\n\nAbundance limit of detection cutoffs are shown as black lines on each\ntimepoint to resemble our template consensus sequences (TCS) Poisson\ndistribution calculation as shown in Zhou et al., 2015 .\n\nDeep sequencing revealed that mutations accumulated in complex patterns.\nWe assessed the sequence complexity of each culture by calculating the\nShannon entropy to allow comparison of changes in the diversity in each\nculture over time and as a function of increasing selective pressure (\nFigure 3A ). In the cultures that showed the early appearance of the\nI84V mutation, this was associated with a peak in entropy, reflecting\nhigh genetic diversity, followed by a decrease in entropy when the I84V\nmutation became fixed ( Figure 3---figure supplement 1A ). The\nintroduction of the I50V mutation was generally not associated with a\ndrop in entropy, rather these populations maintained high genetic\ndiversity even at higher drug concentrations ( Figure 3---figure\nsupplement 1B ). We interpret these patterns as indicative of I84V\nconferring some level of resistance without a dramatic loss in fitness,\nallowing a more homogeneous culture (i.e., less entropy). In contrast,\nI50V may confer a higher level of resistance but at a greater fitness\ncost, thus supporting greater diversity in the culture either as\ncompensatory mutations or as other combinations of mutations with lesser\nresistance but higher fitness. In this regard, we previously showed I50V\nsignificantly reduces the fitness of the virus relative to the fitness\nloss of a virus with I84V as single mutations ( Henderson et al., 2012\n).\n\nWhen we examined the sequence diversity as assessed by Shannon entropy\nfor all selections that reached at least 1 µM in inhibitor\nconcentration, we found that cultures starting with the mixture of\nresistant viruses averaged a nearly twofold higher entropy value\ncompared to the cultures where the selection started with just the virus\ngenerated from the NL4-3/wild-type clone (3.0 vs. 1.6, p\\<0.0001\nMann--Whitney test; Figure 3B--D ). This was unexpected as both sets of\nselections passed through many genetic bottlenecks. This result is most\neasily explained if the rates of recombination were fairly high\nthroughout the culture period so that most sequence variants were\nmaintained at least at a low level. However, at the end of the selection\nperiod no wild-type variants could be detected in the cultures by deep\nsequencing.\n\n### The chemical nature of R1 and R2 determines the resistance pathway\n\nWe next examined whether the inhibitor structure influenced the\nresistance pathway chosen. We found that the R1 group, that is, the\n(S)-2-methylbutyl (R1-1) or the 2-ethyl-n-butyl (R1-2), largely defined\nthe resistance pathway observed; for these inhibitors, the R1 group\ntakes the position of P1\\' in the protease substrate analog, occupying\nthe S1\\' subsite. With the UMASS-1 through -5 series (the smaller R1-1\ngroup), the I84V mutation appeared first in six of seven cultures. In\ncontrast, the UMASS-6 through -10 series with the larger R1-2 group, the\nI50V mutation appeared first in eight of nine cultures (p=0.009,\nFisher's exact test; in this analysis, we included two cultures that did\nnot reach at least 400 nM inhibitor concentration but did fix an initial\nset of mutations to increase our sample size \\[V3mut, V5mut\\], and we\ndid not include two cultures where both I84V and I50V were initially\nfixed together \\[V2wt, V5wt\\]). We considered the possibility that the\nstarting mixture of viruses in the mutant selection might skew the\npathway selected, especially since the mutant pool included I84V but not\nI50V. However, in only one of the eight cultures with sufficient data\nfrom both selections was there a switch from the I84V pathway to the\nI50V pathway between the first and second selections (cultures of\nUMASS-6 with an R1-2 group). Thus, we conclude that the P1'-equivalent\nchemical structure of the inhibitor is a strong determinant of the\nresistance pathway selected. It is notable that one inhibitor could\nselect for different pathways in two separate selections (also seen with\nDRV, see Figure 2---figure supplement 4 ) even when both major mutations\nare maintained in the viral population ( Figure 3---figure supplement 2\n). This suggests that either pathway can provide some level of\nresistance to most if not all of these inhibitors, and that the chance\naddition of the initial compensatory mutations may determine which\npathway becomes the major resistant population.\n\nTo examine the potential for linked mutations and infer the order in\nwhich mutations accumulated in the protease gene to confer high-level\nresistance, the abundance data from multiple selections that ended in\none or the other pathway were pooled and compared. In this analysis,\nshown in Figure 4A , summary data for the selections resulting in the\nI84V pathway point up, with I84V reaching 100% penetrance by definition.\nSimilarly, the summary data for those selections that fixed I50V are\nshown pointing down, with I50V reaching 100% penetrance. Several\nmutations are uniquely linked or at least strongly favored in each\npathway, with I84V being linked to V32I, and I50V being linked to I47V,\nF53L, and I13V. A number of mutations appear in both pathways, although\nnot with equal frequency: L10F, L33F, M46I, I54L, A71V, and V82I.\nFinally, other mutations appear less frequently, making it difficult to\nassign them to one of these categories. These results show that while\nsome mutations are largely linked to one pathway, other mutations are\noften shared between the two pathways. Also, the variation in frequency\nof appearance of shared mutations in the two pathways suggests different\nlevels of impact on resistance and/or fitness in the I84V vs. the I50V\nbackground for these mutations (e.g., L10F, M46I and A71V). In\nparticular, the larger impact of I50V on fitness compared to I84V\nmutations ( Henderson et al., 2012 ) is consistent with the earlier\nappearance and greater levels of fixation of the shared compensatory\nmutations L10F, L33F, M46I, and A71V in the cultures that followed the\nI50V pathway. In Figure 4B , we show a summary timeline of the ordered\naddition of mutations for each pathway and whether they are shared or\nunique to the pathway (in addition to their relative penetrance/final\nprevalence among the different cultures). In Figure 4---figure\nsupplement 1 , we show phylogenetic trees of the viral protease sequence\nfrom these longitudinal selections annotated to show where in the tree\neach of the fixed final mutations entered the viral population. These\nresults emphasize that there are stochastic elements in the selection\nprocess that make each culture different in detail but that by pooling\nthe data across the cultures underlying patterns are apparent.\n\n\n**Introduction of mutations at increasing drug concentrations.**\n\nPhylogenetic trees of wild-type selection cultures against UMASS-1 and\nUMASS-8, showing the addition of mutations found in I84V and I50V\npathways. Each mutation's position and color denote the drug\nconcentration at which that mutation became prevalent in the population.\nThe most abundant viral variant present at the final timepoint of each\nselection is underlined above the corresponding tree.\n\nWe next considered the possibility that the R2 constituent would provide\nadditional selective pressure in the form of additional resistance\nmutations. We did not detect any novel mutations associated with any of\nthe R2-1 through R2-5 inhibitors ( Figure 2 ). However, as noted\nearlier, the inhibitors with R2-2 and R2-5 in the smaller R1-1\nbackground (UMASS-2 and UMASS-5) resulted in the selection of resistant\nvirus where both of the primary resistance mutations (I84V and I50V)\nwere present and linked. The comparable R2 inhibitors in the R1-2\nbackground (UMASS-7 and UMASS-10) selected for just the I50V primary\nmutation consistent with the larger R1-2 structure. Thus, for inhibitors\nwith three of the R2 moieties (R2-1, R2-3, R2-4) the selection of the\nprimary resistance pathway was determined by the size of the R1 moiety.\nThis was also true for the R2 moieties R2-2 and R2-5 with the larger\nR1-2 moiety, selecting for I50V; however, these same two R2 moieties are\nable to change the interaction of the smaller R1-1 moiety to drive\nselection of both primary resistance mutations demonstrating a role for\nR2 in influencing the resistance pathway.\n\n### The chemical nature of R1 and R2 determines residual potency among the resistant variants\n\nWe considered several variables in examining the nature of the\ninteraction between inhibitors and the resistant proteases: the extent\nto which the inhibitor structure (either R1 or R2) affected residual\npotency; and the extent to which the pathway (I84V or I50V) conferred\nthe greatest resistance. As shown in Figure 5A , the inhibitors with the\nsmaller R1-1 group showed a trend to be less potent than the inhibitors\nwith the larger R1-2 group when tested against all of the resistant\nproteases. Inhibitors with the R2-2 group showed a trend toward greater\nresidual potency against the mutant enzymes compared to the other\ninhibitors ( Figure 5B ). In looking at the individual pathways, the\nhighly resistant enzymes with the I84V mutation remained more sensitive\nto the entire group of inhibitors than the enzymes with the I50V\nmutation ( Figure 5C ).\n\nFigure 5.\n\n**Analysis of K ~i~ values for mutant enzymes.**\n\nK ~i~ values were determined against all UMASS inhibitors ( Table 1 ).\nBrackets above the bars represent significant p-values between the two\ngroups using the unpaired *t* -test. Data were pooled in different ways\nfor the following analyses: ( **A** ) the K ~i~ values against the\ninhibitors with the larger R1-2 moiety (n = 34) were more potent against\nresistant proteases compared to the inhibitors with the smaller R1-1\nmoiety (n = 35) ( **B** ) K ~i~ values for the inhibitors with the R2-2\ngroup (n = 10) showed a trend toward being more potent against the\nhighly mutated proteases compared to the other R2 groups (n = 40). (\n**C** ) K ~i~ values for enzymes with the I50V mutation (n = 33) showed\ngreater resistance to the inhibitors compared to enzymes with the I84V\nmutation (n = 22). ( **D** ) The R1-2 moiety provided increased potency\nto enzymes with the I84V mutation (n = 20) but not the I50V mutation (n\n= 20). ( **E** ) The R2-2 moiety was more potent against the enzymes\nwith I84V mutation (n = 10) compared to the enzymes with the I50V\nmutation (n = 10). The unpaired *t* -test was used to assess differences\nin K ~i~ values. Error bars show standard deviation.\n\nWe next linked the two pathways to the specific structural features of\nthe inhibitors. The resistant proteases with I50V had similar K ~i~\nvalues to both the R1-1 and R1-2 inhibitors, while the proteases with\nI84V were more sensitive (lower K ~i~ ) to the larger R1-2 inhibitors (\nFigure 5D ). Similarly, the increased potency of the R2-2 inhibitors\nover the rest of the inhibitors was seen against the enzymes carrying\nI84V but not those with I50V ( Figure 5E ). These results are consistent\nwith the smaller R1-1 inhibitors selecting for the I84V pathway and the\nlarger R1-2 inhibitors selecting for the I50V pathway, and with the R2-2\ninhibitors adding additional potency that is retained even after\nselection for resistance, most apparent with the I84V pathway.\n\nResidual potency dependence of inhibitor structure could also be seen in\nthe EC ~50~ values of the resistant virus pools. When the EC ~50~ values\nagainst the virus pools using the I84V or the I50V pathway were compared\nfor all of the inhibitors, the inhibitors with the larger R1-2 group\nwere more potent, retaining on average lower EC ~50~ values compared to\nthe EC ~50~ values for the inhibitors with the smaller R1-1 group (\nFigure 6A ). Inhibitors with the R2-2 group showed a trend toward\ngreater potency compared to the other R2 groups ( Figure 6B ),\nconsistent with what was observed in enzymatic assays. When we\nconsidered the effects based on the selection pathway, we observed that\nviruses in the I50V pathway had a higher level of resistance to these\ninhibitors than the viruses in the I84V pathway ( Figure 6C ). The\nhigher level of resistance for the viruses using the I50V pathway was\ndue to the fact that these viruses were similarly resistant to the\ninhibitors with either the R1-1 or the R1-2 groups; in contrast, the\nviruses using the I84V pathway conferred a greater level of resistance\nto the inhibitors with the smaller R1-1 group while the inhibitors with\nthe larger R1-2 group retained a higher level of potency ( Figure 6D ).\nFinally, there was a trend for viruses in either pathway to be less\nresistant to the inhibitors with the R2-2 group ( Figure 6E ).\n\nFigure 6.\n\n**Analysis of EC ~50~ values for mutant virus cultures.**\n\nEC ~50~ values were determined for a subset of the selected virus\ncultures against a panel of inhibitors (n = 50). For ( **A--E** ), the\nEC ~50~ data were pooled using the same methods and sample numbers as in\nFigure 5 . The highest level of resistance recorded was 100 µM. The\nMann--Whitney rank-sum test was used to assess differences in EC ~50~\nvalues. Error bars show standard deviation.\n\n### DRV favors the I84V pathway\n\nDRV has a butyl group at the R1 position, smaller than the R1-1\nmethylbutyl in the UMASS-1 through -5 series. We carried out five\nselections with DRV where the final inhibitor concentration reached\ngreater than 1 μM. One DRV selection was carried out in parallel with\neach of the two different selections with the UMASS inhibitors ( Figure\n2A ); both of these selections resulted in the appearance of the I84V\nmutation as defining the resistance pathway. Three additional selections\nwere done in parallel with DRV and starting with the mixture of the 26\nisogenic mutants; all three selections reached the level of 5 μM as the\nhighest drug concentration. Two of these selections used the I84V\npathway to resistance, while one of the selections used the I50V pathway\nto resistance ( Figure 2---figure supplement 4 ). Thus, four of five\nindependent selection with DRV favored the resistance pathway I84V,\nassociated with a smaller R1 constituent. These results add further\nevidence for the size of the R1 moiety strongly influencing the\nresistance pathway.\n\n### The I84V pathway and the I50V pathway differentially select for Gag cleavage site mutations\n\nCleavage site mutations are seen during selection for resistance to\nprotease inhibitors ( Su et al., 2019 ). This can be viewed as\nprotease-substrate coevolution, and the effect is most apparent at the\ncleavage sites flanking the spacer peptide SP2 in Gag (NC/SP2 and\nSP2/p6) ( Kolli et al., 2006 ; Kolli et al., 2014 ; Kolli et al., 2009 ;\nLee et al., 2012 ; Özen et al., 2011 ; Özen et al., 2012 ; Özen et al.,\n2014 ; Prabu-Jeyabalan et al., 2004 ). We sequenced the protease\ncleavage sites encoded in the viral *gag* gene in the pools of selected\nviruses where the inhibitor concentration had reached a level of greater\nthan 1 µM ( Figure 7A ). An analysis of four cultures that had I84V as\nthe major resistance mutation showed they all had a mutation at the\nNC/SP2 cleavage site at position P2, with a change from the wild-type\nalanine amino acid to either of the larger aliphatic amino acids valine\nor isoleucine. In addition, three of the four I84V cultures had a\nmutation at the adjacent SP2/p6 cleavage site, either at P1\\' (leucine\nto phenylalanine) or P5\\' (proline to leucine). Conversely, all seven\ncultures where the I50V mutation was the major resistance mutation there\nwas a mutation in the SP2/p6 cleavage site, but not in the NC/SP2 site.\nFinally, in the three cultures where the protease evolved both the I50V\nand I84V mutations, Gag mutations were observed only at the SP2/p6\ncleavage site (the presence or absence of the NC/SP2 mutation in the\nI84V cultures but not in the I84V/I50V cultures has a p value of 0.03 in\na Fisher's exact test). Two of three cultures with both I84V and I50V\nhad both the P1\\' (leucine to phenylalanine) and P5\\' (proline to\nleucine) mutations. In contrast, mutations at both P1\\' and P5\\'\ntogether were underrepresented in the cultures with only I50V. An\nexamination of the modeling ( Figure 7B ) suggests that the NC/SP2\nmutation at P2 in the presence of the I84V mutation may engage I50 to\nreplace the lost interaction with I84V as it moves away from the P2\nsidechain by shortening (I to V); this would explain the absence of this\ncleavage site mutation in the double protease mutant (I50V/I84V) since\nthe shortening of both protease sidechains provides too little\ninteraction with the longer P2 sidechain. The P1\\' and P5\\' mutations in\nthe SP2/P6 site appear to act in a complementary way as typically only\none is seen with either the I50V or the I84V mutant proteases ( Figure\n7C ). The SP2/p6 P1\\' and P5\\' mutations engage the protease by\ndifferent mechanisms ( Özen et al., 2014 ) suggesting their effects are\nadditive; thus in these selections the single mutation at P1\\' or P5\\'\nmay be sufficient to recover an appropriate rate of cleavage with either\nthe I84V or the I50V mutant protease, but the additive effects of the\nP1\\' and P5\\' mutations may be needed to rescue cleavage by the\nI50V/I84V mutant protease.\n\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nDRV is a notable PI both for its tight binding to the HIV-1 protease and\nfor its ability, with boosting doses of ritonavir, to reach micromolar\nlevels of drug concentration in the blood. These features are important\nas resistance to PIs typically requires multiple mutations affecting\nboth resistance and the rescue of enzyme activity/fitness lost with\nprimary resistance mutations ( Arribas et al., 2012 ; Clemente et al.,\n2004 ; Henes et al., 2019 ; Mahalingam et al., 2002 ; Muzammil et al.,\n2003 ; Ragland et al., 2014 ; Wensing et al., 2010 ). While we were\nsuccessful in selecting for resistance to DRV in cell culture, the\nspectrum of mutations observed largely overlap those seen in previous\nstudies based on testing individual mutations for their effect on DRV\nsensitivity ( de Meyer et al., 2008 ; King et al., 2004 ; Rhee et al.,\n2003 ). In this work, we have explored chemical modifications to the DRV\nscaffold. We found that modification of the P1\\'/R1 chemical structure\nto be a larger aliphatic group favored the use of the I50V resistance\npathway compared to the smaller DRV structure or an intermediate-sized\nstructure, forcing the virus to use the more deleterious I50V mutation\ncompared to the I84V mutation used with the smaller P1\\'/R1 structures.\nConversely, we identified a subset of the P2\\'/R2 groups that\ncontributed to residual potency even in the resistant proteases but did\nnot select for novel resistance mutations; however, several of the R2\ngroups that conferred higher potency selected both major primary\nmutations but only with the smaller R1-1 methylbutyl group. Thus,\nchemical modifications at both of these inhibitor positions yielded\nimprovements over DRV and an unexpected linkage between the R1 and R2\ngroups in that anchoring the R2 group to the protease backbone enhanced\nthe potency of the intermediate-sized R1 group, at least as assessed by\nits selective pressure.\n\nThe potency of these inhibitors can be inferred by the high genetic\nbarrier to high-level resistance. The maximum drug concentrations of DRV\nachieved in the blood are nearly 1000-fold above the EC ~50~ in cell\nculture ( Kurt Yilmaz et al., 2009 ), and therapy failure with\nresistance mutations for therapies involving DRV are rare and most often\noccur in people who had previously failed therapy with other protease\ninhibitors with drug resistance. An examination of the Stanford\nUniversity HIV Drug Resistance Database ( https://hivdb.stanford.edu/ )\nshows a catalog of approximately 25,000 reported HIV-1 sequences with at\nleast one protease resistance-associated mutation, with the majority of\nthese linked to some level of phenotypic resistance to DRV. For\nsequences associated with a greater than 200-fold change in resistance\nto DRV, there were an average of 5.4 resistance-associated mutations\n(with a maximum of seven mutations). Thus, these levels approach the\nlevels of resistance we have obtained and highlight the potential for\ncreating an even higher genetic barrier to resistance in vivo.\n\n### P1\\'/R1 modification\n\nDRV has a relatively small butyl group at this position that most often\nselected for an I84V mutation. When we extended this moiety by a single\nmethyl group to (S)-2-methylbutyl, we obtained a similar resistance\nselection profile. However, by extending it with an additional methyl\ngroup to (S)-2-methylbutyl or 2-ethyl-n-butyl create an inhibitor that\nswitched the preferred selection to the I50V pathway. In Figure 8A--C\nare shown representations of structures of a subset of the inhibitors\nwith the different P1\\'/R1 groups with the wild-type protease, the I84V\nmutant protease, and the I50V mutant protease. As we have previously\ndiscussed ( Lockbaum et al., 2019 ; Mittal et al., 2013 ), in these\nstructures it is apparent that the P1\\'/R1-1 group is directed at the\nprotease I84 sidechain, consistent with the shortening of this sidechain\nas a major resistance mechanism. Conversely, the longer P1\\'/R1-2 group\nis oriented into the space between I84 and I50, thus drawing in I50V as\nthe pathway to resistance. As noted in the longitudinal analysis of the\nselection pathway, the I50V resistance pathway presents additional\nchallenges to the virus in the more rapid accumulation of compensatory\nmutations ( Figure 4 ). Under the circumstances of rapidly declining\nviral load during the initiation of therapy, this need for additional\nmutations would represent an enhanced genetic barrier.\n\nFigure 8.\n\n**Structural interpretation of protease inhibitor resistance and of\nresidual inhibitor potency.**\n\n( **A--C** ) Hydrophobic packing in the S1' subsite in complex with R1\nstructural groups; darunavir is shown in cyan, UMASS-1 in magenta, and\nUMASS-6 in salmon.

When we examined the\ninteractions between protease and inhibitor, there is a clear structural\nexplanation ( Figure 8D--F ). The less potent inhibitors interact with\nthe protease side chains and backbone at D29 and D30 through a network\nof water molecules. In contrast, with the more potent R2-2 group the\nwater molecules are replaced with direct interactions between inhibitor\nand protease in the S2\\' subsite ( Figure 8E ). This direct interaction\nmore closely mimics the interaction made by the glutamine P2\\' side\nchain in the optimized protease cleavage site at the SP1/NC boundary (\nFigure 8F ). Thus, the ability to replace the water-mediated\ninteractions with a more rigid framework that is interacting with the\nprotease backbone deep in the S2\\' pocket appears to be a unique feature\nof the inhibitors with R2-2. Improved potency in another series of PIs\nwas also reported for this R2-2 P2\\' moiety ( Zhu et al., 2020 ).\n\nWhile the different R2 structures did not select for any novel\nresistance mutations, we did note that the two inhibitors with the\ngreatest potency as enzymes (UMASS-2 and UMASS-5) were the only\ninhibitors that selected for I84V and I50V linked on the same genome (\nFigure 2A ). This represents a third distinct outcome since in these\ncases the smaller methylbutyl R1-1 is also able to engage I50. As noted\nabove, the R2-2 group is directly anchored to the protease backbone. We\nexamined the effect this has on the R1-1 orientation. However, we did\nnot see any difference in the placement of the R1-1 group when comparing\nUMASS-1 (which preferentially selects for I84V) and UMASS-2 (which\nselects for linked I84V/I50V). It is possible that anchoring to the\nbackbone with R2-2 for UMASS-2 makes the R1-1 group less mobile,\nreducing the magnitude of the effect of the I84V mutation allowing the\ninhibitor to maintain some level of interaction with I50, although this\ninference was not tested directly.\n\n### Protease mutation networks and compensatory mutations in the resistant pathways\n\nIn most of the selections, either the I84V or the I50V mutation was\nlargely fixed by the time the inhibitor concentration reached 10 nM in\nthe culture ( Figure 3 , Figure 3---figure supplement 2 ). The viral\ncultures went through cyclical changes in population diversity as\nsubsequent mutations were added ( Figure 3A ). Because of the large\nnumber of selections, it was possible to pool data and see trends in the\nway mutations were added in these two pathways. Resistance mutations\nthat were detected in multiple selections summed to at least 16\npositions ( Figure 2A ). While these mutations are well known, their\nrelationships to each other, and as a function of selective pressure,\nare less well understood. The data in Figure 4 show strong linkage\nbetween I84V and V32I, while I50V shows linkage with I47V and F53L.\nThese linked compensatory mutations are each close to the primary\nresistance mutation, suggesting they interact directly with the primary\nresistance mutation to adjust its position within the subsite to limit\ninteraction with the inhibitor and/or improve interaction with the\nsubstrate.\n\nOther mutations appeared often in both pathways but could be found\nearlier and/or more frequently in one pathway: in the I84V pathway G16E\nand I54L were favored; in the I50V pathway L10F, I13V, L33F, M46I, L63P,\nand A71V were favored. In contrast to the linked compensatory mutations,\nthe shared compensatory mutations are often more distant in the\nstructure from the primary resistance mutation. Mutations distal from\nthe active site modulate the enzymatic activity and fitness by altering\nthe dynamic ensemble ( Foulkes-Murzycki et al., 2007 ; Henes et al.,\n2019 ; Leidner et al., 2021 ; Ragland et al., 2014 ; Ragland et al.,\n2017 ; Whitfield et al., 2020 ) of the enzyme (i.e., conformations\nsampled). While these changes can sometimes enhance enzymatic activity,\nthey also often significantly contribute to high levels of resistance (\nHenes et al., 2019 ; Matthew et al., 2021 ) as is observed in these\nselections. As can be seen in Figure 2E , there is a strong correlation\nbetween increasing resistance (lower K ~i~ ) and lost catalytic\nefficiency (larger kcat/K ~m~ ). This suggests that compensatory\nmutations may attenuate fitness loss but do not restore it, or they\nimpact resistance, or both. The role of mutations outside of the active\nsite has been of interest for a long time ( Foulkes-Murzycki et al.,\n2007 ; Kovalevsky et al., 2006 ; Louis et al., 2011 ; Ode et al., 2006 ;\nShen et al., 2010 ). In Figure 4B , it can be seen that the same\ncompensatory mutation is part of two different resistance pathways but\nwith differing selective pressure to add the mutation, hinting at the\ncomplexity of the role of such mutations and their pathway-specific\ncontributions.\n\nIn summary, using a number of lengthy selections for resistance to a\nseries of structurally related PIs we have been able to identify the\nsize of the hydrophobic chain at the P1\\'-equivalent position of the\ninhibitor as the major determinant for selection of the I84V pathway\nwith a smaller P1\\'-equivalent chain, including for DRV, versus a larger\nP1\\'-eqivalent hydrophobic chain driving selection of the I50V pathway.\nAlso, one of the P2\\' groups tested gave a higher level of potency even\nin the face of high-level resistance by creating a direct interaction\nwith the protease backbone. This also led to coselection of I84V and\nI50V as linked mutations. These chemical changes in the inhibitor\nincrease the genetic barrier for the evolution of resistance and\nemphasize the potential utility of what a fifth-generation HIV-1 PI\ncould add to regimens with reduced drug complexity.\n\nDRV has been used as the starting point for other approaches in\nenhancing potency ( Matthew et al., 2021 ). These other studies have\nexamined similar, but not identical, structural changes to DRV as\ndescribed here. There is a cautionary note in comparing between\ndifferent inhibitors that can be seen in Figure 2---figure supplement 3\n, where the nature of the chemical structure at one site (R2) reverses\nthe order of potency of structures at another site (R1) in the\ninhibitor. Thus, comparisons between DRV derivatives where there are two\nor more differences may be problematic in terms of trying to infer\nparallels or differences. The original description of DRV included a\ncompound with the same R2-2 that was also highly potent ( Surleraux et\nal., 2005 ), and R2-2 has been tested in the context of other changes in\nDRV ( Delino et al., 2018 ). R2-4 has been tested on the DRV backbone\n(GRL-98065) that was further modified at the P1-equivalent position to\ngive the inhibitor brecanavir ( Amano et al., 2007 ; Hazen et al., 2007\n). The R2-5 P2\\'-equivalent has previously been shown to have\ninteractions with PR amino acids 29/30 in the S2\\' subsite ( Bulut et\nal., 2020 ). The DRV backbone has also been used as the basis for more\nextensive chemical changes giving rise to a number of potent HIV-1\nprotease inhibitors ( Aoki et al., 2017 ; Cihlar et al., 2006 ; Ghosh et\nal., 2008 ; Ghosh et al., 1998 ; Ghosh et al., 2020 ; Ghosh et al.,\n2018a ; Ghosh et al., 2006 ; Ghosh et al., 2018b ; Ghosh et al., 2017 ;\nHazen et al., 2007 ; Miller et al., 2006 ; Miller et al., 2005 ; Miller\net al., 2004 ; Nalam et al., 2013 ; Rusere et al., 2019 ).\n\nDRV represents a potent antiviral due in large part to its ability to\nachieve drug levels in the blood that are far above the EC ~50~ and the\nfact that high-level resistance requires many mutations (a high genetic\nbarrier). However, we have shown that resistance usually follows the\nless deleterious I84V pathway. The UMASS-2 inhibitor anchors the R2-2\ngroup to the protease backbone and allows the intermediate-sized R1-1\ngroup to co-select both the I84V and I50V pathways, creating an even\nhigher genetic bar. These improvements could become important if\nprotease inhibitors are moved to dosing using a long acting depot where\ndrug mass becomes limiting. The enhanced potency of UMASS-2 could\npotentially be traded for reduced maximum drug levels allowing a given\nmass of drug to provide antiviral coverage for a longer period of time.\n\n\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Cell lines and viruses\n\nCEMx174 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf\nserum and penicillin-streptomycin. TZM-bl and 293T cells were maintained\nin Dulbecco's modified Eagle-H medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf\nserum and penicillin-streptomycin. A wild-type virus stock NL4-3 was\nprepared by transfection of the pNL4-3 plasmid (purified using the\nQIAGEN Plasmid Maxikit) into HeLa cells. For the mixture of isogenic\nmutant viruses, the following NL4-3 variants were created, each with a\nsingle mutation in the protease with this mixture forming the virus pool\nfor the initiation of selection with mutant viruses: L10I, K20R, K20I,\nL24I, D30N, V32I, M36I, M46I, M46L, I47V, G48V, F53L, I54V, I62V, L63P,\nA71T, A71V, G73S, V77I, V82A, V82T, I84V, N88D, N88S, L90M, I93L (\nHenderson et al., 2012 ). The cell lines used in this study came from\nthe NIH HIV Reagent Program or ATCC, and were initially expanded and\nfrozen down. Cells from these low-passage frozen stocks were thawed and\nused in experiments, and typically replaced within 1 y. Authentication\nof cell lines was based on assessments of the providers. Cell phenotypes\nwere monitored for their ability to generate virus after transfection\n(293Ts), support viral replication (CEMx174), or report viral infection\n(TZM-bl). The following cell lines were obtained through the NIH HIV\nReagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: 174xCEM Cells, ARP-272,\ncontributed by Dr. Peter Cresswell and TZM-bl Cells, ARP-8129,\ncontributed by Dr. John C. Kappes, Dr. Xiaoyun Wu and Tranzyme Inc. The\nHEK-293Ts cells were obtained from ATCC, CRL-11268, and used directly\nupon receipt to created an expanded stock. Certificates of analysis are\navailable on ATCC to include HEK293Ts. Cells obtained from the frozen\nstock were periodically tested for mycoplasma and were consistently\nnegative.\n\n### Selections\n\nAn aliquot of 3 × 10 ^6^ CEMx174 cells was incubated at 37°C for 2--3 hr\nwith 250 µl of a virus stock generated from the HIV-1 infectious\nmolecular clone pNL4-3. The culture volume was then brought to 10 ml\nwith RPMI medium. Each flask received one of the following inhibitors at\nescalating concentrations: UMass1, UMass2, UMass3, UMass4, UMass5,\nUMass6, UMass7, UMass8, UMass9, UMass10, DRV, and no drug (ND). After 48\nhr and every 48 hr after, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation and\n10 ml of fresh medium and inhibitors were added. When the culture had\nundergone extensive cytopathic effect (CPE) indicative of viral\nreplication, the supernatant medium and the cells were harvested\nseparately and stored at --80°C. The virus-containing supernatant was\nused to start the next round of infection, and after several rounds at\nthe initial concentration, the inhibitor concentration was increased\n1.5-fold at each subsequent round of virus passage. The level of\nresistance (50% inhibitory concentration \\[EC ~50~ \\]) of the single\ninhibitor-selected virus pools was determined by a TZM infection assay\nin which the PI is added to productively infected cells and the titers\nof supernatant virus made in the presence of the inhibitor are\ndetermined.\n\n### TZM infection assay\n\nPI dilutions were prepared by taking 10 µM stocked and performing a\nfivefold serial dilution using RPMI media (final drug concentration is\n100 µM). One dilution of drug was added to each well of a 24-well plate\nand repeated so each virus would have a full set of dilutions. Viruses\nfor the assay were made by seeding 3 × 10 ^6^ CEM cells in a 24-well\nplate and incubating with 250 µl of virus at 37°C for 2--3 hr before\nbringing the culture to 10 ml with RPMI media. After 48 hr, the medium\nwas changed and repeated every 48 hr after until the culture had\nundergone CPE. Infected CEM cells were collected and diluted so that 1\nml of cells could be plated in each well containing a unique drug\ndilution. Then 24 hr later the virus supernatant was collected from each\nwell followed by filtering through a 0.45 µM filter then placed in\n--80°C. Viruses were thawed and added to 96-well plates in triplicate.\nTZM-bl cells were collected and diluted to a concentration of 2 × 10 ^5^\ncells/ml, 100 µl were added on top of the pre-plated viruses. Plates\nwere kept in 37°C, 5% CO ~2~ in an incubator for 48 hr. After 48 hr, the\ncells in the plates were lysed by removing the medium, washing two times\nwith 100 µl PBS, and then lysed with 1× lysis buffer (made from 5×\nPromega Firefly Lysis Buffer). Plates were frozen for at least 24 hr and\nthen thawed for 2 hr before analyzing with Promega Firefly Luciferase\nKit on a luminometer. Data was analyzed with Prism 7 to fit sigmoidal\ndose--response curves.\n\n### DNA preparation and amplification of the protease-coding region\n\nTotal cellular DNA was isolated from infected cell pellets by using the\nQIAamp blood kit (QIAGEN). The protease-coding domain of viral DNA was\namplified by nested PCR. The PCR conditions are available upon request.\nPCR products were purified by using QIAquick PCR purification kit\n(QIAGEN) and directly sequenced or cloned into the pT7Blue vector\n(Novagen) and sequenced.\n\n### Primer-ID deep sequencing of viral RNA\n\nWe used the PID protocol to prepare MiSeq PID libraries with multiplexed\nprimers. Viral RNA was extracted from plasma samples using the QIAamp\nviral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Complementary DNA (cDNA)\nwas synthesized using a cDNA primer mixture targeting protease (PR) with\na block of random nucleotides in each cDNA primer serving as the PID,\nand SuperScript III RT (Thermo Fisher). After two rounds of bead\npurification of the cDNA, we amplified the cDNA using a mixture of a\nforward primer that targeted the upstream coding region, followed by a\nsecond round of PCR to incorporate the Illumina adaptor sequences.\nGel-purified libraries were pooled and sequenced using the MiSeq 300\nbase paired-end sequencing protocol (Illumina). The sequencing covered\nthe HIV-1 PR region (HXB2 2648-2914, 3001-3257).\n\nWe used the Illumina bcl2fastq pipeline for the initial processing and\nconstructed template consensus sequences (TCSs) with TCS pipeline\nversion 1.33 ( https://github.com/SwanstromLab/PID ) ( Zhou, 2019 ). We\nthen aligned TCSs to an HXB2 reference to remove sequences not at the\ntargeted region or that had large deletions. We used the Entropy tool at\nLANL ( https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/ENTROPY/entropy.html )\nto calculate entropy for each specimen. The sequencing data is available\nat NIH Sequencing Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject ID PRJNA853351.\n\n### Protease expression and purification\n\nThe highly mutated, resistant, protease variant genes were purchased on\na pET11a plasmid with codon optimization for protein expression in\n*Escherichia coli* (Genewiz). A Q7K mutation was included to prevent\nautoproteolysis ( Rosé et al., 1993 ). The expression, isolation, and\npurification of WT and mutant HIV-1 proteases used for enzymatic assays\nwere carried out as previously described ( Henes et al., 2019 ; King et\nal., 2002 ; Özen et al., 2014 ). Briefly, the gene encoding the desired\nHIV-1 protease was subcloned into the heat-inducible pXC35 expression\nvector (ATCC) and transformed into *E. coli* TAP-106 cells. Cells grown\nin 6 l of Terrific Broth were lysed with a cell disruptor twice, and the\nprotein was purified from inclusion bodies ( Hui et al., 1993 ).\nInclusion bodies, isolated as a pellet after centrifugation, were\ndissolved in 50% acetic acid followed by another round of centrifugation\nat 19,000 rpm for 30 min to remove insoluble impurities. Size-exclusion\nchromatography was carried out on a 2.1 l Sephadex G-75 Superfine (Sigma\nChemical) column equilibrated with 50% acetic acid to separate high\nmolecular weight proteins from the desired protease. Pure fractions of\nHIV-1 protease were refolded using a tenfold dilution of refolding\nbuffer (0.05 M sodium acetate at pH 5.5, 5% ethylene glycol, 10%\nglycerol, and 5 µM DTT). Folded protein was concentrated to 0.5--3 mg/ml\nand stored. The stored protease was used in K ~M~ and K ~i~ assays.\n\n### Enzymatic assays\n\n#### K ~m~ assay\n\nK ~m~ values were determined as previously described ( Henes et al.,\n2019 ; Lockbaum et al., 2019 ; Matayoshi et al., 1990 ; Windsor and\nRaines, 2015 ). Briefly, a 10-amino acid substrate containing the\nnatural MA/CA cleavage site with an EDANS/DABCYL FRET pair was dissolved\nin 8% DMSO at 40 nM and 6% DMSO at 30 nM. The 30 nM substrate was 4/5\nserially diluted from 30 nM to 6 nM. HIV-1 protease was diluted to 120\nnM and, and 5 µl were added to the 96-well plate to obtain a final\nconcentration of 10 nM. Fluorescence was observed using a PerkinElmer\nEnvision plate reader with an excitation at 340 nm and emission at 492\nnm, and monitored for 200 counts. A FRET inner filter effect correction\nwas applied as previously described ( Liu et al., 1999 ). Data corrected\nfor the inner filter effect was analyzed with Prism7.\n\n#### K ~i~ assay\n\nEnzyme inhibition constants (K ~i~ values) were determined as previously\ndescribed ( Henes et al., 2019 ; Lockbaum et al., 2019 ; Matayoshi et\nal., 1990 ; Windsor and Raines, 2015 ). Briefly, in a 96-well plate,\ninhibitors were serially diluted down from 2000 to 10,000 nM depending\non protease resistance. All samples were incubated with 5 nM protein for\n1 hr.

TAF is currently in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Phase 1 and 2 studies have shown that TAF was associated with increased peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) drug loading and increased suppression of HIV-1 replication compared to treatment with TDF. In this study, selection of in vitro resistance to both TAF and the parent compound, TFV, led to the emergence of HIV-1 with the K65R amino acid substitution in RT with 6.5-fold-reduced susceptibility to TAF. Although TAF is more potent than TFV in vitro, the antiviral susceptibilities to TAF and TFV of a large panel of nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant mutants were highly correlated (R2 = 0.97), indicating that the two compounds have virtually the same resistance profile when assessed as fold change from the wild type. TAF showed full antiviral activity in PBMCs against primary HIV-1 isolates with protease inhibitor, nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), or integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance but reduced activity against isolates with extensive NRTI resistance amino acid substitutions. However, the increased cell loading of TFV with TAF versus TDF observed in vivo suggests that TAF may retain activity against TDF-resistant mutant viruses.\nRationale: The paper describes the resistance selection experiments conducted with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and tenofovir (TFV).

InfCareHIV functions equally as a decision support\nsystem as a quality registry, ensuring up-to-date data reported in real\ntime.\n\n### Participants\n\nInfCareHIV includes data on \\>99% of all people with diagnosed HIV in\nSweden and up to now 13 029 have been included in the cohort. InfCareHIV\nincludes data on HIV-related biomarkers and antiretroviral therapies\n(ART) and also on demographics, patient-reported outcome measures and\npatient-reported experience measures.\n\n### Findings to date\n\nSweden was in 2015 the first country to reach the UNAIDS (United Nations\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS)/WHO's 90-90-90 goals. Late diagnosis of HIV\ninfection was identified as a key problem in the Swedish HIV-epidemic,\nand low-level HIV viraemia while on ART associated with all-cause\nmortality. Increased HIV RNA load in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\ndespite suppression of the plasma viral load was found in 5% of PLHIV, a\nphenomenon referred to as 'CSF viral escape'. Dolutegravir-based\ntreatment in PLHIV with pre-existing nucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitor-mutations was non-inferior to protease inhibitor-based\nregimens. An increase of transmitted drug resistance was observed in the\nInfCareHIV cohort. Lower efficacy for protease inhibitors was not due to\nlower adherence to treatment. Incidence of type 2 diabetes and insulin\nresistance was high in the ageing HIV population. Despite ART, the risk\nof infection-related cancer as well as lung cancer was increased in\nPLHIV compared with HIV-negative. PLHIV were less likely successfully\ntreated for cervical precancer and more likely to have human\npapillomavirus types not included in current HPV vaccines. Self-reported\nsexual satisfaction in PLHIV is improving and is higher in women than\nmen.\n\n### Future plans\n\nInfCareHIV provides a unique base to study and further improve long-term\ntreatment outcomes, comorbidity management and health-related quality of\nlife in people with HIV in Sweden.\n\n\n## Cohort description\n\n### Study population\n\nThe InfCareHIV cohort was established in 2003 in the two largest cities\nin Sweden, Stockholm and Gothenburg. These two cities care for about\nhalf of all PLHIV in Sweden. The other Swedish clinics joined thereafter\nand since 2008 the cohort has had complete national coverage, including\nall 29 clinical HIV centres in Sweden. To date (August 2022), 13 029\nPLHIV have been included of whom 8436 are currently in active care (\ntable 1 , figure 1 ). In total 42 PLHIV have been diagnosed with HIV-2\nof whom 28 are in active care. In the beginning of the HIV epidemic the\nmajority of PLHIV were born in Sweden, most of whom were men who have\nsex with men (57.5%) or transmitted through intravenous drug use (26.9%)\n( online supplemental table 1 ). The number of migrants with HIV, in\nparticular from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and Asia, increased gradually,\nas did the proportion of women and heterosexually transmitted\nindividuals ( online supplemental table 1 ). A study performed between\n2009 and 2012 found 58% of newly diagnosed in Sweden to be late\npresenters (CD4 \\<350 cells/µL or AIDS) and 38% to have an advanced\ninfection (\\<200 cells/µL or AIDS). Ten years later the proportion of\nlate diagnosis remains high (63% and 42% with CD4 \\<350 and \\<200,\nrespectively). ^6\\ 7^\n\nFigure 1\n\nYear of HIV diagnosis. People with diagnosis \\<1983 were diagnosed\nretrospectively on biobanked blood once HIV-testing was introduced.\n\n\n#### Supplementary data\n\nbmjopen-2022-069688supp001.pdf\n\nOf those in active care (August 2022) 39% are women and 1.2% are\nchildren below 18 years of age. A majority was born outside Sweden\n(67%), most commonly in SSA (36%). About half (51%) have stated\nheterosexual mode of transmission, about one-third are men who have sex\nwith men or bisexual men (31%). Only 4% have stated intravenous drug use\nas mode of transmission while 3% were mother-to-child transmissions,\n1.4% through blood products and for 9.6% transmission mode is unknown or\ninformation is missing ( table 1 ). Almost all are on ART (98%), and of\nthem almost everybody (95%) reaches the treatment goal of HIV-RNA \\<50\ncopies/mL (98% HIV-RNA \\<200 copies/mL) in snapshot analysis after at\nleast 6 months of treatment. ^10^ Of the 4483 people no longer on\nfollow-up in InfCareHIV, 56% are deceased, 34% have emigrated and 3% are\nlost-to follow-up. InCareHIV also includes undocumented migrants who\noften end-up among the 3% that are lost-to follow-up ( table 1 ).\nRetrospective data from before the cohort was established as nation-wide\nin 2008 has been backlogged, including PLHIV deceased before 2008.\n\n### Coverage and validation of the study population\n\nThe national coverage is nearly 100% as all 29 clinical centres that\nattend PLHIV are included in InfCareHIV, and more than 99% of all\ndiagnosed PLHIV who are living in Sweden are included. This number has\nbeen repeatedly validated on an aggregated level, most recently in 2019,\nagainst the number of HIV-diagnoses reported to the Public Health Agency\nof Sweden, a report that is mandatory by Swedish law. The validations\nfound that data regarding HIV diagnoses were even more accurate in\nInfCareHIV than in the Public Health Agencies records. When transferring\nbetween clinics the person keeps their individual InfCareHIV identity\nnumber with no data lost.\n\n### Cohort variables\n\nVariables collected and manually registered by a health professional at\nenrolment include sex at birth, gender identity (added 2021), country of\nbirth, mode of HIV transmission, date of any last negative HIV-test and\nfirst positive HIV-test (in Sweden and if relevant abroad), any AIDS\ndiagnoses (eg, pneumocystis pneumonia, oesophageal candidiasis or\ntuberculosis), confirmed primary HIV infection and suspected country of\nHIV transmission ( online supplemental table 2 ). Data are\ncollected/updated at each follow-up visit; manually or automatically\ndepending on the type of data and the HIV centre. Data include ART start\nand stop dates, ART regimen (including doses and mode of administration)\nand the reason for any change of drug regimens, prophylaxis of\nopportunistic infections and selected co-medications. Serological and\nvirological data on co-infection with hepatitis C and B virus, weight,\ndate and type of AIDS-defining events, date and cause of death are also\nincluded. HIV-RNA (plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) and HIV drug\nresistance (including viral sequences) results, described as both\nmutations and predicted phenotypic sensitivity, as well as CD4+ and CD8+\nT cell counts and CD4/CD8 ratios are either automatically or manually\nincluded depending on the HIV centre. HIV-1 subtype and HLA\nB-5701-allele are registered ( online supplemental table 2 ).\nPregnancies and following deliveries are also registered. Socioeconomic\ndata such as civil status, education level or income is not included in\nInfCareHIV.\n\n#### Supplementary data\n\nbmjopen-2022-069688supp002.pdf\n\n### Validation of cohort variables\n\nValidation of data is performed regularly on national level using a Data\nQuality Index, with the possibility to validate also on clinical and\nindividual level. Data Quality Index for InfCareHIV is currently at 4.9\non a 0--5 scale. Data are also validated through the Distributed Data\nManagement tool which enables data extraction for data sharing and\nautomatically conducts quality assurance checks that signal any\nincorrect values that may then be manually corrected. This tool is\nderived and modified from a collaboration with EuroCoord, the European\nNetwork of HIV/AIDS Cohort studies to coordinate at European and\nInternational Level Clinical Research on HIV/AIDS. ^11^\n\n### Ethics\n\nAt time of entering HIV care, PLHIV are informed about the registry,\nafter which they can either give verbal consent or opt out. Participants\nalways have the right to exit InfCareHIV, although this has been very\nuncommon. Participants can request an extract on their data from the\nregistry, free of charge, in accordance with the European General Data\nProtection Regulation (GDPR 2016/679) and the Swedish Data Protection\nAct (2018:218).\n\n### Patient and public involvement\n\nA representative from a Swedish organisation for PLHIV (\nwww.hiv-sverige.se ) is co-opted to the InfCareHIV steering committee. A\nweb page ( www.infcarehiv.se ) contains information for both PLHIV,\nprofessionals involved in HIV care, researchers and the public.\nStatistics and treatment results of the individual clinical centres are\npublished openly in an annual report and on the web page.\n\n### Decision support system\n\nThe mainstay of InfCareHIV is the clinical decision support system (\nfigure 1 ). Data on HIV-RNA levels (plasma and CSF), CD4 cell counts\n(absolute and percentage), drug resistance and previous and current ART\nare presented through a graphical system. In addition, the legend below\nthe graph presents data regarding date of HIV diagnosis, date of first\nART and names of the HIV-team consisting of doctor, nurse and\ncounsellor. Periods of pregnancy are also shown in the graph. All other\ninformation is easily accessible in the system. Also, since all viral (\n*pol* ) sequences are stored in the database, reanalysis can easily be\nperformed when new drugs or new information about resistance appear.\nThus, data generated in clinical care are automatically 'reused' for\nresearch and development. The graph gives the clinician a relevant\nvisual summary that is easier to grasp than the medical records,\nespecially in treatment experienced PLHIV with a long history of\ndifferent ART. Meanwhile the graph is also a pedagogical instrument\nduring patient consultation, facilitating patient-centred care, making\nit easy to illustrate, for example, the consequences of good or poor\ntreatment adherence. HRQoL is also illustrated in the graph ( figure 2\n). Finally, the graph is used when transferring PLHIV between clinic\ncentres, for expert-consultancy and at multidisciplinary team\nconferences.\n\nFigure 2\n\nClinical decision support system with results from self-reported health\nquestionnaire below the graph. Red symbolises low ratings that need\nattention (very unsatisfied/unsatisfied), yellow medium ratings (rather\nunsatisfied/rather satisfied) and green contentment (satisfied/very\nsatisfied), online supplemental table 3 .

The aim of a quality registry is to develop and ensure quality\nof care systematically and continuously. This allows for comparisons on\nHIV care at a national, regional and clinical centre level and has led\nto increased equality of care on national level with diminishing\ndifferences in treatment results in Sweden's HIV centres. We believe it\nis most likely that this contributed to that Sweden in 2015 was the\nfirst country to reach the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS\n(UNAIDS)/WHO's 90-90-90 goal with 90% diagnosed, 90% of them on ART and\n90% of them with viral suppression. ^10^ In concordance with WHO/UNAIDS\nupdated goal, we are now measuring the 95-95-95 goal and have also added\n95 goals for HRQoL.\n\n### Health-related quality of life\n\nSystematical quantification of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) will\nassist the improvement of medical care and HRQoL of PLHIV. In 2011, a\n9-item self-reported Health Questionnaire (HQ) was integrated to the\nregistry to be answered annually by PLHIV either via a website or using\na computerised or paper version at the outpatient clinic ( online\nsupplemental table 3 ). ^12^ The questionnaire was developed together\nwith representatives from PLHIV patient organisations. The HQ assesses\npatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) regarding physical,\npsychological and sexual health, self-reported ART adherence, experience\nof side effects and patient-reported experience measures regarding\ninvolvement and satisfaction with care. A question on smoking habits was\nadded in 2017. The questionnaire is electronically available in Swedish\nand English and in paper version in the eight most common languages in\nthe InfCareHIV cohort. Illiterate patients are offered help by a\nnurse/interpreter. The results are presented in the Decision support\nsystem ( figure 2 ) and used at the patient's routine clinical follow-up\nvisit. The HQ enhances patient-centred HIV care by focusing the\nconsultation on the patients current needs. The red signal symbolises\nlow ratings ( *very unsatisfied/unsatisfied),* that need attention,\nyellow medium ratings ( *rather unsatisfied/rather satisfied* ) and\ngreen contentment ( *satisfied/very satisfied),* ( online supplemental\ntable 3 ). There is a standardised clinical manual for the health\npersonnel with suggestions on how to manage yellow and red alerts (eg,\nscreening for depression and asking about intimate partner violence if\npsychological well-being gets a yellow or red alert). The HQ is\nvalidated by content validity and test--retest reliability and has also\nbeen evaluated as a tool for longitudinal follow-up of trends in PROs.\n^12--14^ Our fourth 95 goal is that 95% of all PLHIV should perform the\nhealth questionnaire and that 95% of PLHIV should have an ART regimen\nwithout experience of side effects. The results from the HQ are also\nused in research, more on that below.\n\nHIV-related stigma and discrimination are major obstacles for reaching\ngood HRQoL. In close relation to InfCareHIV we developed a 12-item HIV\nstigma scale, a short version of the commonly used 40-item HIV Stigma\nScale by Berger *et al* . ^15^ It is a valid and reliable instrument for\nthe measurement of enacted, anticipated and internalised stigma and\ncrucial for mapping trends in the prevalence of HIV-related stigma and\ntracking the effectiveness of stigma-reducing interventions. ^15\\ 16^\n\n### Biobank\n\nIn the major clinical centres blood plasma/serum/liquor samples are\ncollected, and in selected cases also peripheral blood mononuclear\ncells, HIV isolates, CSF and CSF cells in biobanks. These biobanks are\nseparate from the cohort but linking between the cohort data and the\nbiobanks can be performed (after ethical permission) for translational\nstudies.\n\n### Selected findings from the past 10 years to date\n\n#### Studies on late presentation\n\nIn a national prospective study, using InfCareHIV linked to patient\nstudy forms, Brännström *et al* found late diagnosis of HIV infection to\nbe a key problem in the Swedish HIV-1 epidemic, where more than half of\nthe patients were diagnosed late, but the majority could have been\ndiagnosed earlier with a more efficient healthcare system. ^6\\ 17\\ 18^\nMost of the patients experienced barriers to HIV testing, but less so if\nthe HIV-test was offered through screening programmes or by a healthcare\nprofessional rather than having to be self-initiated. ^19\\ 20^ Results\nfrom the study have been adopted by the Public Health Agency of Sweden\nand have had implications for the Swedish governmental National strategy\nagainst HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. ^21^\n\n#### Studies on comorbidity and mortality\n\nElvstam *et al* reported an association between low-level HIV viraemia\nwhile on ART and all-cause mortality, ^22^ and has further explored the\neffects of detectable viraemia during ART by linking InfCareHIV to\nNational Health registries and analysing stored biobank samples.\n^23--27^ Malmström *et al* studied risk of cancer by HIV status in\nSweden for three decades, finding that PLHIV have a remaining increased\nrisk of infection-related cancer despite ART, while lung cancer was the\nonly non-infection-related cancer increased in PLHIV. ^28^ By linking\nInfCareHIV to the National Cervical Cancer Screening registry, Carlander\n*et al* showed that PLHIV are less likely to have successful treatment\nof cervical precancer and more likely to have human papillomavirus (HPV)\ntypes not included in current HPV vaccines. ^29--32^ These results were\nused when the national cervical-cancer-screening recommendation was\nupdated in 2022. ^33^ Bratt *et al* showed that the incidence of type 2\ndiabetes and insulin resistance is high in the ageing HIV population,\nwhere comorbidities are common and associated whereas there was no\nassociation found for HIV-related factors. ^34^ Möller *et al* showed\nthat well-treated PLHIV are not at higher odds of severe COVID-19\ncompared with HIV-negative people after controlling for age and\ncomorbidity. ^35^\n\n#### Studies on HIV infection of the central nervous system\n\nGisslén *et al* have used InfCareHIV in a substantial number of studies\nexploring CSF viral load and other biomarkers in different settings of\nuntreated and treated HIV. ^36--54^ Viral load is normally one log lower\nin CSF than in plasma in untreated HIV, ^55^ but CSF exceeds plasma HIV\nRNA in approximately 15% of patients, with considerable variations\nbetween different disease stages. ^36^ Central nervous system (CNS)\ninfection is generally well controlled by systemic suppressive ART, ^56^\nalthough in approximately 5% the HIV RNA load was increased in the CSF\ndespite suppression of the plasma viral load, a phenomenon referred to\nas 'CSF viral escape'. ^41^ This phenomenon is most often transient, not\nassociated with any symptoms and comparable to plasma viral blips ^57^\nwhich occur in about the same frequency. ^58^ Several studies have\nindicated that a stable, permanent infection of cells in the CNS is\nestablished later than in systemic viral reservoirs, ^40^ which has\nimplications when exploring HIV eradication strategies. ^59^\n\n#### Studies on elite controllers\n\nSönnerborg *et al* have extensively studied, since the 1990s, long-term\nnon-progressors and elite controllers (EC), selected from the InfCareHIV\ncohort. Specific immunological ^60^ and metabolic features have been\ndescribed. ^61^ Also, a naturally occurring dipeptide was found to be\nenhanced among EC and to possess antiretroviral properties, acting as\nboth an entry inhibitor and an RT-inhibitor. ^62^\n\n#### Studies on drug resistance mutations\n\nSönnerborg *et al* have also studied HIV drug resistance, both\ntransmitted and acquired, and the molecular HIV epidemiology. Among\nseveral key findings, an increase of transmitted drug resistance in the\nInfCareHIV cohort ^3^ was reported. A pronounced HIV-1 subtype\nheterogeneity, including all known subtypes, many circulating\nrecombinant forms and unique recombinant forms was also described. ^63^\nSörstedt *et al* studied the effect of dolutegravir-based treatment in\nPLHIV with pre-existing NRTI-mutations and found a non-inferior effect\ncompared with protease inhibitor-based regimens ^64^ and has also\nexplored viral blips during ART. ^58^\n\n#### Studies on patient-reported outcomes and experiences\n\nSvedhem *et al* validated the Health Questionnaire and demonstrated that\nself-reported adherence in the HQ was correlated to viral suppression\nand described determinants of optimal ART-adherence in the cohort. ^12^\nSvedhem *et al* have shown that the assessment of PROMs is an important\ntool to ensure the long-term adherence to treatment, improvement in\nquality of life and evaluate side effects on HIV treatment. ^12\\ 14^\nPROMs have also successfully been used in virological molecular\nmodelling showing that lower affinity for protease inhibitors to HIV-1C\nprotease do not depend on lower adherence to treatment among people\ninfected with subtype C. ^13^ Tyrberg *et al* compared plasma drug\nlevels of ART, potential drug--drug interactions and side-effects in\nPLHIV aged ≥65 years of age, with controls ≤49 years of age, and found\ndifferences in drug concentrations and reported side effects between\ngroups. ^65^\n\nMellgren *et al* demonstrated that the experience of side effects of ART\ndeclined significantly in the cohort during 2011--2017 and that\nexperiences of side effects were diverse and associated with both\nself-reported physical and psychological health. ^14^ Two studies on\nself-reported sexuality by Mellgren *et al* found that self-reported\nsexual satisfaction in PLHIV improved annually and that women were more\nsatisfied with their sexual life compared with men. ^66\\ 67^ In women\nliving with HIV, satisfaction with sexual life was associated with\nself-reported psychological health and experiences of side effects.\nCarlander *et al* showed that over the past 20 years access to\nemployment has increased in PLHIV although remaining lower compared with\nHIV-negative, even after controlling for migrant and socioeconomic\nstatus. ^68^\n\n### International collaborations\n\nInfCareHIV has collaborated or collaborates with several international\nHIV cohorts such as EuroCoord, EuroSIDA, RESPOND, PENTA, COHERE,\nCASCADE, CHAIN, NEAT, EuResist, EuCare, UCSF CSF Cohort and CARE.\n\n### Future plans\n\nInfCareHIV provides a unique base to continue study long-term treatment,\ncomorbidities and HRQoL of people with HIV in Sweden. Half of all PLHIV\nis still diagnosed late and studies that can help improve HIV-testing\nguidelines and HIV awareness are essential. Attempts are made to develop\nmore precise bioinformatics tools for assessment of time of infection\nand the undiagnosed population. Pretreatment HIV drug resistance is a\ncritical aspect that requires global collaboration and long-term\nfollow-up. Despite most PLHIV reaching the treatment goal of\nundetectable viral level, patient reported health is still poorer than\nfor HIV-negative people and studies on how to improve HRQoL in PLHIV and\nminimise stigma should be prioritised. With our ageing cohort, studies\non comorbidity become more important and specially to assess what\ncomorbidities are associated with normal ageing and what comorbidities\nmay be associated with ART or HIV-induced chronic inflammation.\nMultiomics using samples and clinical information is presently evaluated\nto identify biomarkers for prediction of comorbidities, to characterise\nthe evolution of CNS inflammation and injury ^45^ and for future\nselection of patients in HIV cure attempts.\n\n### Strengths and limitations\n\nThe main strength of the InfCareHIV cohort is that it includes all\ndiagnosed PLHIV in Sweden. The accuracy, completeness, consistency and\nvalidity is very high and consequently InfCareHIV has the highest\ncertification level among Swedish Health Quality registries according to\nthe Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions. ^69^ The\npersonal identity number given to all Swedish residents enables linkage\nof data to any Swedish population or health registry after appropriate\napplication, providing opportunities to answer a wide range of research\nquestions. Also, the automatic transfer of key laboratory data,\nincluding viral sequences, and the possibility of linking cohort data\nand biobanks allow easy reuse of information obtained in clinical care\nfor research purposes. Some variables in InfCareHIV (eg, comorbidity,\nweight and self-reported smoking status that has been added in later\nyears) lacks in coverage which currently limits their use in research\nbut linking to other health registries for the collection of this data\nis then a possibility. The aim is for all PLHIV to be invited to answer\nthe self-reported health questionnaire annually to facilitate patient\ncentred care and improve HRQOL, although currently we reach only about\n34%, and it is a prioritised matter to improve this number.\n\n\n**Funding:** The authors have not declared a specific grant for this\nresearch from any funding agency in the public, commercial or\nnot-for-profit sectors.\n\n## Data availability statement\n\nData are available upon reasonable request. Data can be made available\nupon reasonable request and after ethical approval.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 30333167\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Low-Bias RNA Sequencing of the HIV-2 Genome from Blood Plasma\nABSTRACT\nAccurate determination of the genetic diversity present in the HIV quasispecies is critical for the development of a preventative vaccine: in particular, little is known about viral genetic diversity for the second type of HIV, HIV-2. A better understanding of HIV-2 biology is relevant to the HIV vaccine field because a substantial proportion of infected people experience long-term viral control, and prior HIV-2 infection has been associated with slower HIV-1 disease progression in coinfected subjects. The majority of traditional and next-generation sequencing methods have relied on target amplification prior to sequencing, introducing biases that may obscure the true signals of diversity in the viral population. Additionally, target enrichment through PCR requires a priori sequence knowledge, which is lacking for HIV-2. Therefore, a target enrichment free method of library preparation would be valuable for the field. We applied an RNA shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) method without PCR amplification to cultured viral stocks and patient plasma samples from HIV-2-infected individuals. Libraries generated from total plasma RNA were analyzed with a two-step pipeline: (i) de novo genome assembly, followed by (ii) read remapping. By this approach, whole-genome sequences were generated with a 28× to 67× mean depth of coverage. Assembled reads showed a low level of GC bias, and comparison of the genome diversities at the intrahost level showed low diversity in the accessory gene vpx in all patients. Our study demonstrates that RNA-Seq is a feasible full-genome de novo sequencing method for blood plasma samples collected from HIV-2-infected individuals.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any experiments or results related to in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

TAF is currently in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Phase 1 and 2 studies have shown that TAF was associated with increased peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) drug loading and increased suppression of HIV-1 replication compared to treatment with TDF. In this study, selection of in vitro resistance to both TAF and the parent compound, TFV, led to the emergence of HIV-1 with the K65R amino acid substitution in RT with 6.5-fold-reduced susceptibility to TAF. Although TAF is more potent than TFV in vitro, the antiviral susceptibilities to TAF and TFV of a large panel of nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant mutants were highly correlated (R2 = 0.97), indicating that the two compounds have virtually the same resistance profile when assessed as fold change from the wild type. TAF showed full antiviral activity in PBMCs against primary HIV-1 isolates with protease inhibitor, nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), or integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance but reduced activity against isolates with extensive NRTI resistance amino acid substitutions. However, the increased cell loading of TFV with TAF versus TDF observed in vivo suggests that TAF may retain activity against TDF-resistant mutant viruses.\nRationale: The paper describes the resistance selection experiments conducted with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and tenofovir (TFV).

Annual proportions of recent infections (RI) among newly diagnosed persons infected with HIV-1 in Slovenia during 27 years (1986--2012) were determined using an algorithm consisting of routine baseline CD4 and HIV viral load measurements and the Aware BED EIA HIV-1 Incidence Test (BED test). The study included the highest coverage of persons diagnosed with HIV during the entire duration of an HIV epidemic in a given country/region (71%). Out of 416 patients, 170 (40.9%) had a baseline CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/mm ^3^ and/or HIV-1 viral load less than 400 copies/ml and were characterized as having a long-standing infection (LSI). The remaining 246 patients were additionally tested using the BED test. Overall, 23% (97/416) of the patients were labeled RI. The characteristics significantly associated with RI were as follows: younger age, acute retroviral syndrome, CDC class A and other than C, no AIDS defining illnesses, HIV test performed in the past, a higher viral load, and a higher CD4 cell count. An interesting trend in the proportion of RI was observed, with a peak in 2005 (47% of RI) and the lowest point in 2008 (12%) in parallel with a rise in the numbers of new HIV diagnoses. This study could help promote the idea of introducing periodic HIV incidence monitoring using a simple and affordable algorithm. J. Med.

We\ncompared the prevalence of low-frequency (2--20%) and high-frequency\n(\\>20%) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI),\nnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), and protease\ninhibitor (PI) DRM.\n\n### Results:\n\nOverall, 190 individuals were included, 72 (37.9%) with acute, 20\n(10.5%) very early, and 98 (51.6%) with recent HIV infection. While all\nDRM detected in plasma appeared in archived proviral DNA, 9\nhigh-frequency mutations were only detected in HIV DNA. These included 3\nNRTI mutations, 4 NNRTI mutations, 1 PI mutation, and 1 H221Y\n(associated rilpivirine resistance) mutation. When considering DRM\n\\<20%, 11 NNRTI and 7 NRTI, 6 PI, and 3 F227L (associated doravirine\nresistance) mutations were found exclusively in HIV DNA. Interestingly,\nwhile 2 high-frequency M184V appeared in both DNA and RNA, low-frequency\nM184I were exclusive to HIV DNA (n=6). No participants experienced\nvirologic failure after initiating ART during the median 25.39 ± 3.13\nmonths of follow-up on treatment.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAlthough most high-frequency DRMs were consistently detected in HIV RNA\nand HIV DNA, the presence of low-frequency DRM in proviral DNA may be\nrelevant for clinicians as these mutations could become dominant under\ndrug selection pressure.\n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Study Cohort\n\nThis study included adults, age ≥18 years, with acute/early HIV\ninfection enrolled in the San Diego PIRC. Individuals who met serologic\nand virologic criteria for acute and early HIV infection was tested\nusing a single-well limiting-antigen avidity enzyme immunoassay\n(Lag-Avidity EIA) and enrolled based on their estimated date of\ninfection (EDI) calculated as previously reported. ^13\\ ,\\ 14^ Briefly,\nEDI status is defined as follows: Acute (antibody \\[HIV Ab-\\]/antigen\n\\[Ag+\\]), Very Early (Ab+/Recency Assay consistent with infection \\<133\ndays), and Recent (recency assay consistent with infection \\<180 days or\nAb+ with documented Ab- in last 365 days). ^13\\ ,\\ 14^ Study\nparticipants were screened for NNRTI, NRTI, and PI mutations in blood\nplasma at baseline (bulk genotyping) before ART initiation (see Table S1\n; detailed list of transmitted DRM and frequencies). Participants were\nencouraged to initiate ART as soon as possible, often at the baseline\nvisit (Day 0).\n\nPlasma HIV RNA levels were measured at baseline (Day 0), weeks 2, 4, 8,\n12, 24, 36, 48, and every 24 weeks thereafter (Cobas Amplicor HIV-1\ntest, Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, California). Viral rebound\nwas defined as a single viral load \\> 50 copies/mL after an undetectable\nlevel as previously described. ^15\\ ,\\ 16^ Samples were collected from\nJanuary 2005 to February 2020 ( Table S2 ). All individuals provided an\ninformed, written consent approved by local institutional review before\nparticipation in this study.\n\n### Sequence Analysis\n\n#### Blood Plasma\n\nBulk genotyping of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) was performed to\nidentify transmitted drug resistance (GeneSeq HIV; Monogram Biosciences,\nInc., South San Francisco, CA or Viroseq v.2.0; Celera Diagnostics,\nAlameda, CA) in blood plasma before ART initiation. ^17\\ ,\\ 18^\nCumulative HIV RNA genotypes based on the IAS drug resistance algorithm\n^19^ for each participant were created by adding up all mutations from\ngenotypic tests for drug classes as previously described. ^20^\n\n#### Archived Proviral DNA\n\nFrom the same blood samples used to assess blood plasma, NGS of HIV\npartial pol was performed to identify DRMs present in archived proviral\nDNA (peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)). Genotypic resistance\ntesting on PR, RT, and IN from proviral HIV-1 DNA was performed using a\nmodified version of the \"deepTypeHIV\" assay (SeqIT GmbH & Co. KG,\nKaiserlautern, Germany). Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated from patient\nPBMCs (10 ^6^ cells) using QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden,\nGermany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) and nested PCR of PR and partial RT were carried out as\npreviously described. ^21^ Amplicons were purified and quantified as\npreviously described. ^21^ Only DRMs present at ≥2% of cleaned mapped\nreads were considered. APOBEC hypermutation filtering was applied to\nreduce the frequency of potentially spurious mutations. ^22^ NGS DRMs\nwere categorized as high frequency and low frequency DRMs defined as\n\\>20% and 2--20% frequencies, respectively.\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\nWilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare (1) time from EDI to first\nART and (2) time from EDI to sampling date between those with and\nwithout M184V/I DRMs.\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Cohort Characteristics\n\nOf the 190 participants, EDI classifications were 37.9% acute\n(n=72/190), 10.5% very early (n=20/190), and 51.6% recent (n=98/190).\nParticipants began ART a median of 82 days \\[IQR:34;139\\] after the EDI\n( Table S2 ).\n\n### DRM Prevalence (HIV RNA versus Archived Proviral DNA)\n\nOverall, we detected NRTI, NNRTI and PI DRMs in 49 out of 190\nparticipants (26%) through either standard sequencing or NGS methods.\nStandard genotyping of plasma HIV RNA detected DRMs in 22 out of 188\nparticipants (12%). Specifically, we detected 4 high frequency NRTI (2\nM184V, 2 M41L) mutations, 19 high frequency NNRTI (13 K103N/S, 6\nE138A/G) mutations, and 3 high frequency PI (1 L90M, 1 M46I/L, 1 V82A/T)\nmutations. All the 26 NRTI, NNRTI, and PI DRMs were also detected in\nproviral DNA. An additional 9 high-frequency DRMs were detected\nexclusively in proviral DNA, including 3 NRTI (1 K70E, 1 L210W, 1\nK219Q/E) mutations, 4 NNRTI (3 K103N/S, 1 Y188L) mutations, 1 PI (D30N)\nmutation and 1 H221Y (associated rilpivirine resistance) mutation (Other\nDRMs) ( Fig. 1 ). Overall, 30 participants (16%) had detectable high\nfrequency NRTI, NNRTI or PI DRM in either HIV RNA or HIV DNA.\n\nFIGURE 1.\n\n**HIV Drug Resistance Mutation (DRM) prevalence**\n\n27 Low frequency DRMs were detected in archived DNA (14.2%). For high\nfrequency DRMs, there were 3 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor\n(NRTI) mutations (1.6%, top and bottom right), 4 non-nucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations (2.1%, top left), 1 protease\ninhibitor (PI) mutation (0.5%, bottom left) and 1 H221Y mutation (0.5%,\nmiddle left) (associated rilpivirine resistance) ^19^ found in only\narchived DNA. 2 high frequency M184V mutations appeared in both PBMC and\nblood plasma, 6 low-frequency M184I were found only in PMBC. Mutations\ndetected in HIV RNA are represented in red. Mutations detected in HIV\nDNA were represented in blue for less than 20% and orange for greater\nthan 20%.\n\nWe also detected 27 low-frequency NRTI, NNRTI, and PI DRMs in archived\nHIV DNA, including 8 NRTI (6 M184V/I, 1 L74V/I, 1 M41L) mutations, 11\nNNRTI (7 M230L/I, 4 E138A/G) mutations, 5 PI (1 I50V, 3 M46I/L, 1\nV82A/T) mutations and 3 F227L (associated doravirine resistance)\nmutations (Other DRMs). The low-frequency DRMs were all considerably\nlower than the 20% threshold aside from one E138A mutation with a\nfrequency of 14%. Overall, 23 participants (12%) had detectable low\nfrequency DRM in HIV DNA.\n\n### 3TC/FTC ART regimen and M184V/I\n\nA total of 137 (72%) of the 190 participants started ART that included\neither lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC). Eight of these 137\nparticipants had M184V/I DRM detected prior to the start of ART. While 2\nhigh frequency M184V mutations were detected in both archived DNA and\nHIV RNA samples, 6 low-frequency M184I mutations were found exclusively\nin HIV DNA ( Fig 1 ). The 2 high frequency M184V mutations were found in\nparticipants who subsequently initiated FTC regimens, while 4 out of the\n6 low-frequency M184I mutations were found in participants who\nsubsequently initiated started 3TC/FTC regimens ( Fig. 2 ). These\nindividuals did not differ by demographics or HIV history compared to\nthe entire cohort. The median pre-ART viral load and time from EDI to\nfirst ART were not statistically different ( *P* = 0.6672).\nAdditionally, the time from EDI to sampling date was not statistically\ndifferent ( *P* = 0.5755). Of note, the 8 participants began ART a\nmedian of 79 days \\[IQR:69;171\\] after the EDI.\n\nFIGURE 2.\n\n**Viral Load Trajectory and ART Regimen in 8 participants harboring\nM184V/I**\n\nWe detected 6 low-frequency M184I and 2 high frequency M184V mutations.\nAmong them, 75% (2/2 M184V; 4/6 M184I) had 3TC/FTC regimens. Each\nhorizontal bar represents different drug regimens for each participant.\n\n### HIV RNA level and Viral Rebound\n\nLongitudinal viral loads for treated participants were monitored with an\naverage follow-up of 25.39 ± 3.13 months following the start of ART.\nDespite identifying both high frequency and low frequency DRMs in either\narchived proviral DNA or blood plasma, there was no evidence of viral\nrebound from any participants during the entire follow-up period,\nincluding the individuals identified with M184V/I and associated 3TC/FTC\ntreatments ( Fig.2 ) (see Table S3 ; detailed list of baseline ARV\ntreatments).\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nStudies have shown that standard genotyping of HIV DNA detects\nsignificantly fewer resistance mutations than RNA genotyping. ^23^\nHowever, deep sequencing of HIV DNA at lower sensitivity thresholds\ndetected more mutations than standard HIV RNA genotyping. Our cohort\nsimilarly reaffirmed that NGS of archived DNA detected more DRMs than\nbulk genotyping of blood plasma. Specifically, we detected 5% more\nhigh-frequency DRM and 14% low frequency DRM in proviral DNA when\ncompared to standard HIV RNA genotyping. It is unclear whether the DRM\n(low frequency or high frequency) identified in archived proviral DNA\nhas any clinical significance and contributing to viral rebound or\nfailure. Regarding M184V/I, there was no association between the\ndetection and earlier DRM sampling dates following EDI. However, the\ndetection of the 6 low frequency M184I only in archived DNA still\nsuggests NGS as the more appropriate method of detection for these\nmutations. As previously reported, ^24^ we found no association between\nthe presence of archived M184V/I and subsequent virological failure even\nin 4 participants who started 3TC based ART regimens.\n\nOur observations are limited by the small cohort sample size, the short\nduration of follow-up for most of the participants, and other factors,\nsuch as possible differences in medication adherence. Additionally,\nalthough we used stored PBMC samples, our comparative analysis was\nlimited because we did not have available plasma for NGS. Considering\nthis limitation, we recognize previous studies which have validated NGS\nof RNA as a more sensitive method that detects additional minority\nmutations. ^25^ Potential determinants for the lack of viral rebound\ninclude starting treatment early and varying participants follow-up\nperiods. \"Considering the lack of follow-up DRM data, we acknowledge\nthat M184V/I may have been present and further disappeared in plasma but\narchived in proviral DNA samples. As previously mentioned, FTC\ncontaining regimens are known to select for the presence of M184V/I if\npresent. ^9^ In our cohort, 6/8 (2/2 high frequency and 4/6 low\nfrequency) M184V/I mutations were identified in participants with FTC\ncontaining regimens. Moreover, we did not investigate integrase\ninhibitors (INSTI) due to the lack of sequencing data. A recent\nsystematic review has shown that INSTI-associated transmitted drug\nresistance (TDR) is infrequent, revealing an overall median surveillance\nDRM prevalence of 0.5% over 75 related studies that had available\nsequences. ^26^ Additionally, INSTI regimens have been previously\nassociated with minimizing M184V/I impact on virological response. ^27^\nIn our study, we found no evidence of virological failure in\nparticipants with preexisting M184V/I. This is in line with a recent\nstudy evaluating the impact of M184V/I on virologic response after\nswitching to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF).\nHere, the authors found that switching to B/F/TAF demonstrated durable\nefficacy in maintaining viral suppression including in those with\npreexisting M184V/I. ^27^ These limitations could lead us to\nunderestimate the negative impact of detected archived DRM during\nprimary infection on first-line ART.\n\nConversely, it is known that the mutation K65R is of concern as it\nconfers cross-resistance to almost all other NRTIs. ^28^ Of note, none\nof the participants in our cohort had any evidence of K65R via bulk\ngenotyping or NGS. Although ART regimens may be susceptible to DRMs\npresent at baseline, beginning treatment early ensures that DRMs remain\nlatent in the reservoir rather than continuously expanding. ^29^ Similar\nto preexisting studies, early ART initiation of our cohort after EDI led\nto sustained viral suppression despite existing DRMs. Overall, comparing\ndeep sequencing of archived DNA and routine genotyping of HIV RNA has\nrevealed that HIV DNA detects additional high frequency and low\nfrequency DRMs. Given that we did not identify any effect on long term\nvirologic outcomes, additional studies are necessary to determine if HIV\nproviral NGS has clinical applications prior to recommending performing\npre-treatment genotypes on DNA.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Funding\n\nThis work was supported by grants from the NIH (San Diego Center for\nAIDS Research, CFAR, AI036214 and AI100665), the Department of Veterans\nAffairs, the John and Mary Tu Foundation, and the James B.

K65R was the most common low-frequency DRM detected in 8 individuals. Eighty-two of the 103 individuals had follow-up viral load data while on cART. Twenty-seven of the 82 individuals harbored low-frequency DRMs. Only 12 of 82 individuals experienced VF. The following low-frequency DRMs were observed in four individuals experiencing VF: K65R, K103N, V108I, and Y188C. No statistically significant difference was observed in the prevalence of low-frequency DRMs between individuals experiencing VF (4/12) and those not experiencing VF (23/70) (P = .97). However, individuals with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors-associated low-frequency DRMs were 2.68 times more likely to experience VF (odds ratio, 2.68; 95% confidential interval, 0.4–13.9) compared with those without (P = .22).\nRationale: The paper focuses on the sequencing and detection of low-frequency drug resistance mutations in HIV-1 from patient samples.

Importantly, 5.8% of participants had INSTI DRMs including major DRMs: Q148K, E138K, G118R, G140A, T66A and R263K.

Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon.\nRationale: The paper doest not mention in vitro drug susceptibility data or phenotypic data.

Calculating quantitative relations between genotype and\nphenotype observations for each inhibitor with cell-based assays\nrequires time and money-consuming experiments. Machine learning models\nare good options for tackling these problems by generalizing the\navailable data with suitable linear or nonlinear mappings. The main aim\nof this study is to construct drug isolate fold (DIF) change-based\nartificial neural network (ANN) models for estimating the resistance\npotential of molecules inhibiting the HIV-1 protease (PR) enzyme.\nThroughout the study, seven of eight protease inhibitors (PIs) have been\nincluded in the training set and the remaining ones in the test set. We\nhave obtained 11,803 genotype-phenotype data points for eight PIs from\nStanford HIV drug resistance database. Using the leave-one-out (LVO)\nprocedure, eight ANN models have been produced to measure the learning\ncapacity of models from the descriptors of the inhibitors. Mean R ^2^\nvalue of eight ANN models for unseen inhibitors is 0.716, and the 95%\nconfidence interval (CI) is \\[0.592--0.840\\]. Predicting the fold change\nresistance for hundreds of isolates allowed a robust comparison of drug\npairs. These eight models have predicted the drug resistance tendencies\nof each inhibitor pair with the mean 2D correlation coefficient of 0.933\nand 95% CI \\[0.930--0.938\\]. A classification problem has been created\nto predict the ordered relationship of the PIs, and the mean accuracy,\nsensitivity, specificity, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC)\nvalues are calculated as 0.954, 0.791, 0.791, and 0.688, respectively.\nFurthermore, we have created an external test dataset consisting of 51\nunique known HIV-1 PR inhibitors and 87 genotype-phenotype relations.\nOur developed ANN model has accuracy and area under the curve (AUC)\nvalues of 0.749 and 0.818 to predict the ordered relationships of\nmolecules on the same strain for the external dataset. The currently\nderived ANN models can accurately predict the drug resistance tendencies\nof PI pairs. This observation could help test new inhibitors with\nvarious isolates.\n\n\n## Methods and Material\n\n### Dataset description\n\nFiltered genotype-phenotype data on the Stanford HIV drug resistance\ndatabase was retrieved for PIs ( Das & Arnold, 2013 ). We have organized\nthis dataset with respect to isolates and inhibitors, and 498 protease\nmutations have been observed. For the HIV-1 PI: 1218 isolates for\natazanavir (ATV), 678 isolates for darunavir (DRV), 1809 isolates for\nfosemprenavir (FPV), 1,860 isolates for indinavir (IDV), 1,562 isolates\nfor lopinavir (LPV), 1907 isolates for nelfinavir (NFV), 1,861 isolates\nfor saquinavir (SQV) and 908 isolates for tipranavir (TPV) have been\nanalyzed for PI susceptibility. In the dataset, 436, 336, 480, 483, 472,\n486, 489 and 409 different mutations have been observed for ATV, DRV,\nFPV, IDV, LPV, NFV, SQV, and TPV, respectively.\n\n### Representation of isolates\n\nFour hundred ninety-eight unique mutations were observed in the eight\nprotease inhibitors dataset. The binary barcoding technique was applied\nhere to represent the isolates that occurred in the dataset, as also\nused in several studies of modeling genotype-phenotype data for various\nHIV-1 inhibitors ( Lu et al., 2018 ). Thus, a 498-dimensional vector of\nbinary entries with 0s and 1s uniquely representing any existing\nisolates is considered. Assume that the 498 unique mutations produce the\nvector *X* = \\[ *x* ~1~ , *x* ~2~ , ..., *x* ~498~ \\] where *x* ~*i*~ is\na mutation pattern that occurred in the dataset. For instance, *x* ~1~\ndenotes the occurrence of the mutation A22S or *x* ~478~ denotes the\noccurrence of the mutation V82A. For example, the isolate *I* ~*j*~\n= \\[A22S, V 82A\\] can be barcoded as *X*\n= \\[1, 0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ..., 0\\] in which only the first and four\nhundred seventy-eighth position take value one, and the remaining\nentries have value zero. Any isolate can be obtained from any\ncombination of these mutations, and the isolate *j* can be defined as 𝐼\n𝑗 = { 𝑎 1 , 𝑎 2 , ... , 𝑎 𝑛 } with\n\n𝑎 𝑘 = { 1 , 𝑖 𝑓 𝑥 𝑘 ∈ 𝐼 𝑗 0 , 𝑜 𝑡 ℎ 𝑒 𝑟 𝑤 𝑖 𝑠 𝑒 .\n\nIn this way, each isolate can be transformed into a unique\n498-dimensional input vector used for the machine learning. The binary\nbarcoding approach has the advantage of representing two or more\nmutational changes in the amino acids since each mutation has a unique\nposition in the 498-dimensional input vector. For example, assuming that\n*x* ~480~ and *x* ~481~ denotes mutations V82F and V82I, the isolate *I*\n= \\[V 82F, V 82I\\] can be represented as *X*\n= \\[0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 1, 0, ..., 0\\]. It is important to note that, the\ngenotype-fold change measurements are made on population of viruses, so\nthat it is possible to find two separate mutations for a single residue.\n\n### Representation of inhibitors\n\nTo construct a drug-isolate-fold change model for the HIV-1 protease\ninhibitors, the molecular representations of the inhibitors have been\nbuilt with binary Morgan fingerprints. The Morgan fingerprints provide\nan effective way of the vector representations of molecules and are\nwidely used in machine learning models ( Jespersen et al., 2021 ). The\nRDKit environment of the Python program has been used to convert the\nsmile representations of ATV, DRV, FPV, IDV, LPV, NFV, SQV, and TPV\ninhibitors to a binary 512-bit vector representation. 234 out of 512\nbits have been seen to provide unique characteristics for 8 PI. Thus,\nthe molecular representation of each PI needs 234-dimensional vectors.\n\n### Artificial neural network (ANN) model for regression\n\nAn ANN model has been constructed with isolate-inhibitor inputs and fold\nchange outputs with the machine learning and deep learning toolbox of\nthe MATLAB program. Since isolates and inhibitors are uniquely\nrepresented by 498- and 234- dimensional vectors, the ANN model has\n732-dimensional input. The ANN architecture includes 732-dimensional\ninput, five hidden layer neurons, and one output neuron with hyperbolic\ntangent-sigmoid and linear activation functions. Logarithms of\nfold-change values in the dataset are taken as output variables of the\nneural network models. In the training process, the scaled conjugate\ngradient algorithm with MATLAB built-in function \"trainscg\" is utilized\nover GPU ( Palmisano & Vella, 2011 ).\n\n### Ensemble processing\n\nSince we have only eight inhibitors, measuring the molecular learning\ncapacity of our ANN model is crucial. In this way, an ensemble learning\nprocedure is used to improve the molecular learning performance of the\nmodel. For each PI, the 100 × 50 model has been trained with the data of\nthe remaining seven inhibitors. From every 50 models, a model is chosen\nthat yields the minimum mean square error for the interior test set of\nthe corresponding PI data. Thus, 100 optimal models are obtained, and\nthe final model is calculated as the average of these models.\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Regression performance of molecular learning models\n\nEight feed-forward neural network models have been constructed with\ndrug-isolate-fold- change (DIF) data by excluding one of the drugs from\ntraining in each case. The ANN model was trained with the remaining\nseven DIF data predicted the excluded results. The sizes of the training\nand test sets were changed according to the excluded PIs (mean values\nare 10,328 and 1,475 for training and test sets, respectively). The\nregression performances of each model are illustrated in Fig. 1 with\ncorresponding *R* ^2^ values (square of the linear correlation\ncoefficient). The best and worst results are obtained by predicting the\noutcomes of the drugs LPV and TPV with *R* ^2^ = 0.822 and *R* ^2^\n= 0.359, respectively. Similarly, predicting the fold-change results of\nthe inhibitor TPV was observed to be the worst in the literature ( Yu,\nWeber & Harrison, 2014 ). The mean *R* ^2^ value of all predictions is\n0.716 and the 95% confidence interval is \\[0.592--0.840\\]. The DIF-based\nANN model provides accurate estimations even if the test data consists\nof unseen drugs. This observation implies that our ANN models accurately\nlearn molecular information from the Morgan fingerprints. The detailed\nperformance results of our DIF-based ANN models are presented in Table 1\n.\n\nFigure 1\n\n**Data *versus* the predicted fold change values from DIF-based ANN\nmodels.**\n\nDIF-based ANN regression models are constructed with the LVO testing\nmethodology. For each figure, the fold-change results are estimated by\nan ANN model, which is trained with the remaining data of the seven PIs.\nThe R ^2^ values correspond to the square of the linear correlation\ncoefficient of the data and prediction.\n\nAn inevitable question is how molecular information changes the\nregression and classification performance of our ANN models. To clarify\nthis, we trained isolate-fold-change (IF) based ANN models for each\ninhibitor and compared them with the current DIF-based models. In Figs.\nS1 -- S2 , the model performances have been compared by measuring *R*\n^2^ and area under the curve (AUC) values for each PI. Table S1 also\nshows the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews correlation\ncoefficient (MCC) scores of both DIF-based and IF-based models. These\nfindings suggest that the DIF-based ANN model performs slightly better\nin terms of regression and classification for six of the eight PIs. The\ntwo models are compatible with the remaining two inhibitors (DRV and\nTPV). Therefore, the molecular information used by the DIF-based model\nprovides a better predictive capability. It is very important to note\nthat IF-based models can never predict fold-change values for novel\nmolecules. The real distinction between DIF and IF-based models is that\nthe DIF-based model can predict fold-change values for a novel drug.\nHence, the DIF-based ANN model has both better learning capability from\nmutant information (by comparing to the IF-based model) and the ability\nto test novel molecules for a given isolate.\n\n### Prediction of drug resistance tendencies for each PI pair\n\nThe inhibition potential of each PI in the presence of various genotypes\nis known to be variable. Tendencies of the logarithmic fold change\nvalues for each PI pair provide valuable information about the\nresistance profiles of the inhibitors, as seen in Fig. 2 . Prediction of\nthese tendencies by the DIF-based ANN models and the corresponding 2D\ncorrelation coefficients are presented in Fig. 2 in a comparative way\nfor each PI pair. For each PI, prediction has been made with the ANN\nmodel trained by the data of the remaining seven inhibitors with an\nensemble learning approach. This procedure shows the molecular learning\ncapacity of our ANN models from the Morgan fingerprints. The minimum and\nmaximum 2D correlation coefficients are 0.892 and 0.954 for TPV-DRV and\nLPV-DRV couples (95% CI \\[0.930, 0.938\\]), respectively. Thus, the\ncurrent DIF-based ANN models can distinguish the inhibitory potentials\nof each PI pair.\n\nFigure 2\n\n**Prediction of the fold-change tendencies with the DIF-based ANN model\nfor each PI pair.**\n\nThe common isolate data of each PI pair and the corresponding DIF-based\nANN model predictions are illustrated with 2D correlation coefficients.\nFor each PI, the prediction is constructed using the DIF-based ANN\nmodel, which is trained with the remaining seven PI data. The\nillustrations show the tendencies of the drug resistances for each PI\npair for common genotypes.\n\n### Classification of PIs with respect to possible common isolates\n\nOur DIF-based ANN models can distinguish the fold change values of each\nPI in the presence of any isolate. In this way, a classification problem\nmeasuring the relationship *log* ( *FoldChange* \\[ *A* , *Isolate*\n\\]) \\> *log* ( *FoldChange* \\[ *B* , *Isolate* \\]) has been constructed,\nwhere A and B are possible protease inhibitors. These relations take\nvalues 0 and 1 depending on the inhibitors and isolates. Therefore, our\nANN models have been trained with the data from seven inhibitors, with\nthe exception of one particular inhibitor considered as test data. The\ncorresponding receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are\nillustrated in Fig. 3 . Area under the ROC curve (AUC) values are\nincluded in the figure. The best and worst AUC values have been obtained\nfor the IDV-LPV and DRV-LPV pairs with 0.992 and 0.818 (95% CI:\n\\[0.950--0.978\\]), respectively. In this context, the current DIF-based\nANN models have ability to capture the binary relations between any PI\npair with high approximation performance.\n\nFigure 3\n\n**Classification performances of the DIF-based ANN models.**\n\nThe DIF-based ANN classification models are constructed with the LVO\nmethodology. For each PI, the classification of resistant and\nnon-resistant isolates is estimated by an ANN model trained with the\nremaining data of the seven PI. The AUC values correspond to the area\nunder the ROC curves, and the accuracy is evaluated with the true\nestimation rate.\n\nPerformance metrics of the current ANN models for capturing binary\nrelations of PI pairs are presented in Table 2 . As indicated in the\ntable, the DIF-based ANN models have a high rate of true prediction for\neach PI pair. The mean accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and Matthews\ncorrelation coefficient (MCC) values have been computed as 0.954, 0.791,\n0.791 and 0.688 (95% CI \\[0.932--0.952\\], \\[0.719--0.863\\],\n\\[0.719--0.863\\] and \\[0.600--0.776\\]), respectively. The most\nconspicuous result here is that the neural network models can classify\nthe inhibitors for resistance profiles, even if that model did not see\nthe corresponding inhibitors in the training process.\n\n### Testing the molecular learning model with the external data set\n\nFor the external dataset, we conducted a search for compounds that were\ncomparable to the eight HIV PIs that were already available in the\nChEMBL database ( Sevenich et al., 2017 ). An initial set of 1,305\ncompounds and their biological activity values were extracted. First,\ncompounds having 70% or less similarity to each drug were filtered out.\nThen, molecules with determined *IC* ~50~ values in mutant viruses were\ncollected. The compounds with determined *IC* ~50~ values in mutant\nviruses were then gathered. Furthermore, the maximum Tanimoto\nsimilarities of these molecules to the current eight PIs were computed\n(using 512-bit Morgan fingerprints), and molecules with 40% or less\nstructural similarity were filtered out. Finally, molecules with 1s in\nthe discarded 278-dimensional fingerprint vectors, that is, molecules\nwith information loss, were filtered out. A final dataset of 87\ngenotype-phenotype relationships involving 51 different molecules was\nobtained (see Data S1 ). Only six of these molecules are in the existing\nPI set (DRV, IDV, NFV, ATV, LPV) and only 20 of 87 genotype-phenotype\nrelations belong to these six PIs. In the presence of eight distinct\nstrains, there is a fold change difference in *IC* ~50~ values for these\nmolecules. Fortunately, the data includes different molecules tested on\nthe same protein, so we can evaluate the efficiency of our ANN model on\nranking of these molecules.\n\nWe have used the eight existing PIs (see Fig. 4 for chemical structures)\nto construct an ANN model as described in the *Methods and Material*\nsection. The main difference is the consideration of all molecules\nrather than the LVO procedure. The Morgan fingerprints of the new 51\nmolecules were determined, and then the similar mapping was used to\nreduce the 512-dimensional vectors into 234-dimensional inputs. It\nshould be noted that the molecules were chosen in such a way that there\nare no 1s in the discarded 278 bits. This condition was specifically\ndesigned into the external dataset. In this approach, we ensure that no\nmeaningful information for novel molecules is lost during the machine\nlearning process.\n\nFigure 4\n\n**Chemical structures of eight PIs utilized in the DIF-based ANN model\ntraining.**\n\nTwo different classification performances of our ANN model were observed\nto test its molecular learning potential. The first is the\nclassification of resistant and susceptible strains for a given PI, with\na threshold fold chance value of 3 ( Shen et al., 2016 ). The goal of\nthis classification task is to evaluate the resistance labeling\nperformance of the current model for diverse molecules. As demonstrated\nin Table 3 , the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, MCC, and AUC\nmetrics of our model for labeling the resistance in external data are\n0.678, 0.536, 0.935, 0.468, and 0.843, respectively. Our ANN model\nperforms satisfactorily statistically on the external dataset as a\nresult.\n\nOur major point is that the built ANN model is capable of ranking the\nefficiency of PIs for a given strain. The external dataset contains 853\npair of resistance scores for 51 different molecules. Our ANN model\npredicted these 853 pair of resistance scores as well, and we measured\nthe ranking performance of the model. This testing approach is identical\nto the previously described tendency and ranking assessments of the\neight existing PIs. For this classification task, the accuracy,\nsensitivity, specificity, MCC, and AUC scores have been 0.749, 0.767,\n0.730, 0.497, and 0.819, respectively (see Table 3 ). As a result, our\nANN model appropriately ranks the compounds based on their resistance\nprofiles (see Fig. 5 for a representative example). The ROCs for both\nresistance classification and ranking classification performances of the\nANN model can be seen in Fig. 6 . The ANN model learned considerable\ninformation from the molecular structure of the eight PIs, according to\nthe ROCs. In summary, if the external PIs have no information loss (no\n1s in the discarded 278 bits within 512 bits) in comparison to the\nexisting eight PIs, our ANN model has a high ability to rank these PIs.\n\nFigure 5\n\n**Resistance classification for two compounds having similar\nstructures.**\n\nA ranking classification example for two compounds that have similar\nstructures with different resistance profiles for the same strain (L10I,\nL19Q, K20R, E35D, M36I, S37N, M46I, I50V, I54V, I62V, L63P, A71V, V82A,\nL90M, E28K, K32E, V35I, T39T, E40DV, M41L, K43E, Y181Y).\n\nFigure 6\n\n**The ROCs corresponding to resistance and ranking classifications for\nthe test data.**\n\nThe DIF-based ANN model has been used to (A) classify the resistance and\nsusceptible strains (B) classify the rankings of 853 pair of resistance\nscores, for various molecules existing our external data. The AUC\nratings associated with the ROC curves measure how threshold\nprobabilities affect FPR-TPR pairs in classification tasks.\n\nOne method for reducing and visualizing high-dimensional data is\nprincipal component analysis (PCA). It is widely used to describe the\nchemical space occupied by a set of molecules. When the descriptors of\nthe compounds are used for analysis, it allows for the clustering of\nsimilar molecules as well as the distinguishing of diverse molecules. To\nverify the applicability of our model in terms of chemical similarity\nand diversity, we have performed the PCA on the external set molecules\nusing 234-dimensional vectors employed for fold-change prediction. We\nonly evaluated the unique molecules in the external set, and for\nmolecules that were tested in several strains and had multiple\nfold-change prediction values, we have taken the values with the largest\nabsolute prediction error (AE). As the first two components, PC1 and\nPC2, were able to represent more than half of the variance in the data\nand accurately depict the correlations between the similarities of the\nmolecules, 234-dimensional vectors for each unique molecule were\nprojected to 2D-space. Figure 7 displays the PCA plot for both training\nand external set compounds and colored according to the AE for\nfold-change prediction or training compound name. According to the\nfigure, other training compounds other than the IDV were not involved in\ncluster formation with external set molecules. Though the same external\nset molecules were not forming clusters, still there were three clusters\nthat contain three or more molecules. For each of these cluster, we have\nselected one representative structure and additionally we have found the\nmaximum common substructure (MCS) using the FMCS algorithm implemented\nin RDKit. We discovered that for all compounds in the cluster with the\nrepresentative structure A in Fig. 7 , the fold-changes were predicted\nwith low errors (AE \\<1.0). The compounds in this cluster have certain\nsubstructures with HIV inhibitors, such as a sulfonamide group, a\nbis-THF alcohol moiety, and a benzodioxole group  ( Sevenich et al.,\n2017 ). The only structural difference in this cluster of compounds was\nobserved on the side chain connecting to the phenoxy group. Our model,\non the other hand, did not perform well for another cluster of compounds\nrepresented by structure B in Fig. 7 . Despite the fact that the MCS for\nthree compounds in this cluster were similar to the preceding cluster,\nrepresented by structure A, there were subtle differences that caused\ncompounds to be in distinct clusters. For these, the cyclohexyl hydroxy\nor cyclopentyl hydroxy group was attached to the N of the sulfonamide\ngroup. Furthermore, the varying side group of the phenoxy group in the\nfirst cluster was shorter in the second cluster since there was only\nphenyl group. Compounds having structure C are represented in another\ncluster, as seen in Fig. 7 . These compounds had a high resemblance to\nthe IDV (see Fig. 4 for a 2D representation of the IDV), and the\nfold-change was predicted with minimal errors (AE \\<1.0). These\ncompounds, like the IDV, have substructure groups such as\npiperazinecarboxamide, indenol derivative, and phenyl group. However,\nthe compounds in this cluster have different attachment groups connected\nto piperazine ring instead of pyridine group in the IDV. We have also\ndiscovered that for the compound where the fold change estimation error\nabove the threshold (AE ≥ 1.0), the exact value was 1.01, indicating\nthat it is negligible. It should be noted, however, that this compound\ncontains a Fluorine substituent, which is known to cause a significant\nincrease in the inhibitory activity of compounds ( Amano et al., 2022 )\nand it may not be easily learnt using our model. This chemical\nsimilarity analysis revealed that our model can predict the fold change\nfor similar compounds with low error, despite the fact that some of the\nexternal set molecules based on our descriptors were not similar (or in\nclose proximity in the PCA plot in Fig. 7 ) to internal set molecules.\n\nFigure 7\n\n**PCA plot for external set molecules obtained using the unique\ncharacteristic 234 bits fingerprint descriptors.**\n\nPCA plot for external set molecules produced with the unique 234-bit\nfingerprint descriptors. The absolute error (AE) for fold change\nprediction using the model is calculated for each molecule. Molecules\nare classified with respect to corresponding AE values (AE =1 is\nselected as threshold). The data points in black are for the existing\neight PIs, which have their names indicated. As demonstrated, example\nstructures from clusters are exhibited and designated A, B, and C. In\nthe 2D depiction, the most prevalent substructures in the same clusters\nhave been highlighted in dark blue.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis article presents a machine learning approach for predicting\nfold-change values using HIV-1 protease inhibitor and isolate\ncharacteristics. The filtered PhenoSense assay results made accessible\nin the Stanford HIV drug resistance database have been used training and\ntesting machine learning models. Seven of the eight inhibitors have been\nused to train drug-isolate-fold change-based feed-forward artificial\nneural networks, with the remaining one serving as test data (LVO). In\nthis context, the LVO procedure produces an objective testing approach\nfor determining the learning capacity of models from the descriptors of\nthe inhibitors. Both inhibitors and isolates have been encoded using\nbinary mappings, which have been shown to be computationally effective.\nBecause of their acknowledged advantages in molecular machine learning\nmodels, the Morgan fingerprints have been exploited as binary mappings\nof protease inhibitors ( Cai et al., 2021 ; Beerenwinkel et al., 2003 ;\nBeerenwinkel et al., 2002 ). An efficient ensemble process has been\nproposed and verified through various quantitative experiments to handle\nthe overfitting trouble.\n\nThe most significant contribution of this research is the construction\nof drug-isolate-fold change (DIF)-based ANN models, as opposed to the\nwidely studied isolate-fold change (IF)-based models ( Amamuddy, Bishop\n& Bishop, 2017 ; Amamuddy, Bishop & Bishop, 2018 ; Wang & Larder, 2003 ;\nDrăghici & Potter, 2002 ; Kjaer et al., 2008 ; Steiner, Gibson &\nCrandall, 2020 ; Wang et al., 2009 ; Shen et al., 2016 ; Shah et al.,\n2020 ; Tarasova et al., 2020 ; Tarasova et al., 2018 ; Ota et al., 2021\n). Because the IF models do not take the molecular fingerprints as\ninput, they are insensitive to molecular structure. This study shows the\npossibility of achieving such a generalized model by feeding models with\nadequate data from various PIs in the presence of isolates. With the use\nof the LVO procedure throughout our investigation, the current DIF-based\nmodels have been shown to be capable of predicting the drug resistance\nprofiles of unknown inhibitors. Even though the Stanford HIV database\nonly has eight available inhibitors, having many isolates for each\ninhibitor has contributed to the learning process, and reasonable\npredictions have been found in the regression performance of remaining\ninhibitors.\n\nThe prediction of drug resistance tendencies for each PI pair is an\nunavoidable expectation from our DIF-based ANN models. Our generalized\nmodels can predict resistance trends with high 2D correlation scores, as\ndemonstrated here. The DIF-based models have provided satisfactory\naccuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and MCC values by creating\nclassification problems from the tendency relations of each PI pair. The\nDIF-based ANN model utilizes valuable information from the Morgan\nfingerprints to predict the fold change values of hidden inhibitors,\naccording to our all-quantitative observations.\n\nWe have shown that our ANN model can categorize resistant and\nsusceptible strains as well as rank inhibitors based on resistance\nprofiles for an external dataset. The external dataset is designed in\nsuch a way that the unique molecules are comparable enough to any of the\nprimary eight PI and there is no bit loss in the reduction procedure of\nthe Morgan fingerprints from 512 to 234 dimensions. Thus, whenever a\nmolecule satisfies these conditions, our DIF-based model has ability to\ncompare this molecule with existing PIs in terms of their resistance\nscores.\n\nInstead of building independent separate models for each inhibitor, this\nstudy offers a fresh viewpoint on the field by incorporating inhibitor\ncharacteristics on the input side of machine learning models. The most\nobvious drawback of our model is the dearth of protease inhibitors with\nsufficient genotype-phenotype information. Nevertheless, our encouraging\nfindings have demonstrated that including genotype-phenotype information\nof novel protease inhibitors will help build more generic\ndrug-isolate-fold change-based machine learning models. Additionally,\nfeeding the DIF-based models with data from many conventional and\nnonconventional inhibitors may result in a unified model for forecasting\ndrug resistance tendencies for any PI pair in the presence of known\ngenotypes. The drug development process for evolvable diseases, such as\nHIV, bacterial infections, and cancer should be fundamentally different\nfrom diseases such as blood-pressure regulators. A drug needs to be\neffective and stay effective through the test of evolution. Predicting\nresistance potentials for drugs is becoming a necessity.\n\n\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis study has revealed the advantages of developing DIF-based models to\npredict drug resistance profiles. Instead of IF-based models, the\ncurrent approach has allowed us to investigate a new model that can\npredict the drug resistance tendencies of PI pairs. Even with only eight\nPIs available, internal and external test results show that the\nDIF-based model takes significant information from inhibitor descriptors\nand leads to satisfactory regression performance. As a result, after\nfinishing this study, it is highlighted on the research agenda to train\nANN models with more inhibitors by expanding the existing dataset. In\nthis context, it will be feasible to track the drug resistance profiles\nof any novel protease inhibitor, and it is strongly believed that these\ninsightful forecasts will be a right direction for moving forward.\n\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThis work was supported by TUBITAK, 2232--International Fellowship for\nOutstanding Researchers, Project number 118C244.

Antiretroviral drugs\nin clinical use were designed for HIV-1 and, unfortunately, some do not\nwork as well, or do not work at all, for HIV-2. This is the case for\nnon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), the fusion\ninhibitor enfuvirtide (T-20), most protease inhibitors (PIs), the\nattachment inhibitor fostemsavir and most broadly neutralizing\nantibodies. Integrase inhibitors work well against HIV-2 and are\nincluded in first-line therapeutic regimens for HIV-2-infected patients.\nHowever, rapid emergence of drug resistance and cross-resistance within\neach drug class dramatically reduces second-line treatment options. New\ndrugs are needed to treat infection with drug-resistant isolates. Here,\nwe review the therapeutic armamentarium available to treat\nHIV-2-infected patients, as well as promising drugs in development. We\nalso review HIV-2 drug resistance mutations and resistance pathways that\ndevelop in HIV-2-infected patients under treatment.\n\n## 2. Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors\n\nThe reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme is responsible for the synthesis\nof proviral DNA, using viral RNA as template ( Figure 1 ). RT has two\ndistinct functions: DNA polymerase that mediates DNA polymerization from\nDNA and RNA templates, and RNase H that mediates RNA degradation in the\ncontext of a DNA/RNA hybrid \\[ 27 \\]. HIV-2 RT is a heterodimer composed\nof two subunits, p68 and p54 \\[ 16 \\]. The larger subunit, p68, contains\npolymerase and RNase H active sites and is divided into four domains:\npalm, fingers, thumb, connection, and RNase H domains. The smaller\nsubunit, p54, is derived from proteolytic cleavage of p68 by the PR and\nlacks the RNase H active site \\[ 28 \\].\n\nFigure 1\n\nThe HIV-2 life cycle and targets for drug intervention. HIV-2 infection\nbegins with the binding of envelope glycoprotein (Env) spikes to\nreceptors on the surface of a CD4 cell (step 1) and to a\nmembrane-spanning co-receptor (e.g., CCR5) (step 2). This process can be\ndisrupted by binding (CD4 binding antibody, Ibalizumab) and entry\ninhibitors (CCR5 antagonist, Maraviroc). Fusion of the viral and\ncellular membranes allows the viral particle to enter the cell (step 3).\nFusion inhibitors (helical domain 1 binding peptides such as P3, 2P3,\nLP-97 and LP-98) can be used to block viral fusion and entry. Inside the\ncell, HIV reverse transcriptase converts genomic RNA into DNA, which is\nreleased into the nucleus within the pre-integration complex (PIC)\nfollowing nuclear import of the capsid (step 5) and capsid uncoating\n(step 6). The reverse transcription process can be blocked using reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitors (3TC, ABC, AZT, FTC, TDF, TAF). Once in the\nnucleus, HIV DNA is integrated into the cell's genome using the enzyme\nintegrase (step 7). HIV DNA integration can be inhibited using integrase\nstrand transfer inhibitors (RAL, EVG, DTG, BIC, CAB). New HIV mRNA is\ntranscribed (step 8) and transported into the cell cytosol (step 9). The\nmRNA serves as a template for HIV protein synthesis (Gag/Gag-Pol\npolyproteins, envelope glycoproteins, accessory proteins) and as\nfull-length genomic RNA. These molecules are transported to the cell\nsurface to be incorporated into new viral particles. Viral particle\nbudding, release and capsid maturation are the final steps in the HIV\nlife cycle (steps 10 and 11). The HIV protease enzyme cleaves the\nGag/Gag-Pol polyproteins, resulting in the mature capsid and fully\ninfectious viruses. Protease inhibitors (DRV, LPV and SQV) bind to the\nHIV-2 protease enzyme and interfere with the maturation step of the\nvirus. Lenacapavir is a capsid inhibitor that acts at multiple steps in\nthe HIV replication cycle. The sites of action of clinical inhibitors\n(red line) are shown.\n\nAlthough sharing a significant amino acid sequence homology, the ATP\nbinding pocket lacks physical depth and is less defined in HIV-2\nrelative to HIV-1, which may influence the ability to bind ATP \\[ 16 ,\n27 , 29 \\]. Furthermore, RT from HIV-2 seems to have reduced\nprocessivity, particularly in the presence of low dNTP concentrations \\[\n30 , 31 , 32 \\]. In this regard, Lenzi et al. \\[ 33 \\] have shown that\nRTs of several HIV-2 strains require higher dNTP concentrations for\nefficient DNA synthesis compared to HIV-1 RT; this can be relevant for\nviral replication kinetics in monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells,\nand resting CD4+ T cells that have very low dNTP concentrations due to\nthe activity of sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartate domain\ncontaining protein 1 (SAMHD1), a triphosphohydrolase that cleaves dNTPs\n\\[ 34 \\]. The accessory lentiviral protein X (Vpx) from HIV-2 and\nrelated SIV lineages degrades SAMHD1 and the human silencing hub (HUSH)\ncomplex, and may help to overcome the lower processivity of HIV-2 RT in\nthese cells and increase viral replication \\[ 34 , 35 , 36 \\].\n\nSince proviral DNA synthesis is essential in the HIV replicative cycle,\nRT has been one of the main targets of ARVs. Currently, there are two RT\ninhibitor classes, the non-nucleoside (NNRTIs) and the\nnucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitors (NRTIs). NNRTIs act by binding in a\nnon-competitive way to HIV-1 RT in an allosteric site approximately 10 Å\nfrom the polymerase active site in the palm domain of the p68 subunit,\nand can induce conformational changes in RT or interfere with the\nmobility of the enzyme \\[ 16 , 37 \\]. NNRTIs comprise the\nfirst-generation inhibitors---delavirdine (DLV), nevirapine (NVP) and\nefavirenz (EFV), and the second-generation inhibitors---etravirine\n(ETV), rilpivirine (RPV), doravirine (DOR), and dapivirine (DPV), which\nis only used in vaginal rings to prevent HIV-1 infection \\[ 38 , 39 , 40\n\\]. The first-generation NNRTIs inhibited HIV-2 strains ROD and EHO at\nconcentrations 50-fold higher than those required to inhibit HIV-1IIIB\n\\[ 41 \\]. Consistent with this, one study showed that treatment of HIV-2\npatients with regimens containing NNRTIs results in poor CD4+ T cell\nrecovery relative to HIV-1-infected patients \\[ 22 \\]. The resistance of\nHIV-2 to NNRTIs is due to sequence and structural differences in the\npocket binding site at positions 101, 106, 138, 181, 188 and 190 in the\nRT that may lead to unfavorable contacts with NNRTIs or pocket binding\nsite destabilization \\[ 16 , 42 \\]. Therefore, NNRTIs are not\nrecommended for the treatment of HIV-2 infection.\n\nNRTIs were the first class of ARVs approved by the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV infection. NRTIs, in the\ntriphosphate form, compete with the natural substrates (dTTP, dCTP, dATP\nor dGTP) of RT \\[ 43 \\]. NRTIs lack the 3′OH group that is present in\nnatural RT substrates, and consequently these inhibitors act as\nobligatory chain terminators, blocking the DNA synthesis.\n\nNRTIs approved for clinical use include lamivudine (3TC), abacavir\n(ABC), zidovudine (AZT), stavudine (d4T), emtricitabine (FTC),\ndidanosine (ddI), tenofovir (TDF), and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) \\[ 38\n, 40 \\]. Except for d4T and ddI, which are not recommended for the\ntreatment of HIV-2 infection due to the rapid selection of drug\nresistance \\[ 44 \\], NRTIs are the backbone of commonly prescribed\nregimens against HIV-2. These regimens mainly consist of two NRTIs\nassociated to one integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTIs);\nalternative regimens comprise a boosted PI that is active against HIV-2\n(darunavir, saquinavir or lopinavir) plus two NRTIs \\[ 14 , 45 , 46 \\].\nIt is noteworthy that the degradation of SAMHD1 by HIV-2 Vpx leads to\nincreased cell concentration of thymidine analogs (AZT and d4T) and may\nlead to decreased activity of AZT against HIV-2 isolates at clinical\nconcentrations used for HIV-1 \\[ 47 , 48 \\].\n\nTAF is the most recent NRTI in clinical use. It is a prodrug of\ntenofovir, which is more stable in blood and plasma \\[ 49 \\], has more\nfavorable renal and bone safety profiles \\[ 50 , 51 \\], and has higher\nanti-HIV-1 activity, in oral doses in humans which are ten times lower\n\\[ 52 \\] than TDF. Two studies have shown that TAF is active against\nclinical isolates from drug naïve and drug-experienced HIV-2-infected\nindividuals with a mean EC ~50~ similar to that of HIV-1 \\[ 53 , 54 \\].\nConsistent with this, a TAF-based regimen (TAF + FTC + DTG) has been\nused successfully in men infected with HIV-1 and an HIV-2 isolate that\ndeveloped resistance to all NRTIs and PIs \\[ 55 \\].\n\nAzvudine (FNC) is a novel cytidine analogue with potent activity against\nHIV-1 (EC ~50~ ranging from 0.03 to 6.92 nM) and HIV-2 (EC ~50~ ranging\nfrom 0.018 to 0.025 nM), and it shows synergism in combination with six\napproved ARVs \\[ 40 , 56 \\]. FNC potently inhibits some NRTI-resistant\nHIV-1 strains bearing the L74V and T69N mutations, and M184I appears to\nbe the key resistance mutation selected by this drug \\[ 56 \\]. A phase\nII clinical trial ( NCT04109183 ) has evaluated the safety and efficacy\nof FNC in HIV-1 infected patients, but its results have not been\npublished so far. Clinical studies of this drug in HIV-2-infected\npatients have not been reported.\n\nBMS-986001 (also known as festinavir, censavudine and OBP-601), a NRTI\nstructurally related to d4T, exhibits more potent activity against HIV-2\nthan against HIV-1 in culture \\[ 54 , 57 , 58 \\]. Festinavir retains\nfull or partial activity against HIV-2 variants with resistance\nmutations K65R, Q151M, and M184V \\[ 54 , 58 \\]. However, the use of this\ndrug was discontinued due to the rapid acquisition of resistance by\nHIV-1 and increases in both peripheral and central fat accumulation \\[\n59 \\]. Clinical studies have not been undertaken in HIV-2-infected\npatients.\n\nIslatravir, known as MK-8591 or EFdA\n(40-ethynyl-2-fluoro-20-deoxyadenosine), is a deoxyadenosine nucleoside\nanalogue that has a very potent activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2\nisolates in cell culture, including isolates with pan resistance to\nother NRTIs \\[ 40 \\]. Its mechanism of action differs from the other\nNRTIs because it retains an extendable 3′OH-group. Islatravir is an RT\ntranslocation inhibitor and its incorporation by the RT leads to\nimmediate arrest of polymerization or termination after the\nincorporation of the next complementary nucleotide \\[ 60 \\]. A\nrandomized phase 2b clinical trial of islatravir in combination with\ndoravirine and lamivudine for treatment-naive adults with HIV-1\ninfection showed, at 48 weeks, a reduction in viral load to lower than\n50 HIV-1 RNA copies per mL in up to 90% of the patients receiving the\nlowest dose (0.25 mg) \\[ 61 \\]. The use of this drug for the treatment\nand prevention of HIV was discontinued in 2021 due to safety concerns\nabout decreases in total lymphocyte count and CD4 count in some\nparticipants receiving islatravir in trials. New studies include a\nclinical trial evaluating the efficacy of a weekly oral combination\nregimen of islatravir and lenacapavir ( NCT05052996 ) and another\nevaluating once-daily oral islatravir plus doravirine as initial ART and\nas switch therapy ( NCT04223778 ). Islatravir has not been used in\nHIV-2-infected patients.\n\n### HIV-2 Resistance to NRTIs\n\nHIV-1 resistance to NRTIs may evolve by two distinct pathways: (i)\nexclusion mechanism, in which the mutated RT (main mutations: K65R,\nK70E, L74V, Q151M and M184I/V) discriminates against the incorporation\nof the drugs, 3TC, FTC and TDF \\[ 62 \\], or (ii) excision ATP-dependent\nmechanism through the removal of incorporated inhibitors (d4T and AZT)\nfrom DNA primers, allowing DNA elongation (thymidine analog-associated\nmutations---TAMs: M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F and K219Q/E) \\[ 63\n\\]. Unlike HIV-1, HIV-2 rarely develops resistance to NRTIs through the\nexcision pathway \\[ 32 \\] because the presence of a methionine at\nposition 73 in HIV-2 RT, instead of lysine as found in HIV-1, prevents\nthe development of resistance through the accumulation of TAMs \\[ 64 \\].\nIn HIV-2, nine resistance mutations (K40R, A62V, K65R, K70R, Y115F,\nQ151M, M184I/V, S215Y) cause significant resistance to 3TC, ABC, AZT and\nTDF ( Table 1 ) \\[ 14 , 26 , 65 , 66 , 67 , 68 , 69 , 70 , 71 , 72 , 73\n, 74 , 75 \\].\n\nM184I or M184V are the primary resistance mutations selected under FTC\nor 3TC treatment, in vitro and in vivo \\[ 14 , 54 , 74 , 75 , 76 , 77\n\\], and lead to a 60-fold increase in IC ~50~ for 3TC and 7-fold\nincrease for ABC, compared with wild type HIV-2ROD \\[ 67 \\]. Phenotypic\nstudies using recombinant HIV-2 isolates have shown that Q151M has a\nsmall impact on the viral susceptibility to 3TC and TDF, confers\nmoderate- to low-level resistance to ABC, and FTC, but is associated\nwith a high level of resistance to AZT \\[ 67 , 70 , 74 \\]. The Q151M\nresistance mutation impairs the RT capacity to discriminate between NRTI\ntriphosphates and dNTPs at the nucleotide-binding site \\[ 78 \\].\nMutation K65R arises in HIV-2-infected patients exposed to TDF and other\nNRTIs \\[ 14 , 25 , 65 , 75 , 79 \\] and can be selected in vitro after\nHIV-2 exposure to increasing doses of TDF \\[ 76 \\], and produces a two-\nto seven-fold decrease in viral susceptibility to the drug \\[ 70 , 76\n\\]. Polymorphic mutation V111I increases the fitness of viruses with\nmutations K65R and Q151M in HIV-2-infected patients \\[ 70 \\].\n\nUsing site-directed mutagenesis of a HIV-2ROD molecular clone, it was\nshown that high levels of resistance to festinavir requires the\ncombination of Q151M and M184V and that K65R causes hypersusceptibility\nto this drug \\[ 58 \\]. More recently, high-level resistance to\nfestinavir was reported in a primary isolate with mutations Q151M and\nK223R \\[ 54 \\]. In this study, one isolate with moderate resistance to\nfestinavir had the mutations V111I, Y115F, Q151M, and M184V.\n\nOverall, these studies show that HIV-2 and HIV-1 develop distinct\nresistance pathways to this drug class. While in HIV-1 the TAMs D67N,\nK70R, L201W, T215Y/F and K219Q/E are typically selected by NRTIs, in\nHIV-2 they are rarely selected and M184I/V, K65R and Q151M resistance\npathways are preferred.\n\n\n\n## 3. Protease Inhibitors\n\nThe HIV protease (PR) is an important target in the treatment of HIV\ninfection due to its role in the proteolytic processing of the precursor\nGag and Gag-Pol polyproteins during virus maturation, leading to the\nformation of mature, infection-competent virions \\[ 80 \\]. PR has two\nidentical monomers with 99 amino acids and consists of three main\ndomains: the active site (which includes the conserved motif\nAsp-Thr-Gly), the dimerization domain and the flap region \\[ 81 \\]. In\nthe active dimeric state, it forms a central cavity where the natural\nsubstrates, the precursor Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins, bind \\[ 82 \\].\nEach monomer contributes one Asp25 residue in the catalytic site of the\nenzyme.\n\nThe PR of HIV-1 and HIV-2 have only 39--48% homology at the amino acid\nsequence level \\[ 83 \\]. However, in structural terms, they are very\nsimilar, especially in the region of Asp catalytic residues (positions\n23--30), as well in a small region that supports catalytic amino acids\nin an appropriate conformation for catalysis (residues 86--88) \\[ 15 \\].\nThe substrate binding pockets are formed by residues in positions 8, 23,\n25, 27--30, 32, 47--50, 53, 76, 80--82 and 84. Of these, only residues\nin positions 32, 46, 47, 76, 82 differ in both viruses \\[ 26 , 84 , 85\n\\]. Most differences between the PRs are at surface level, while the\nregions essential for the enzyme function are conserved; however,\ncertain polymorphisms decrease binding affinity of PR for certain\ninhibitors, and may lead to resistance to PIs \\[ 86 \\].\n\nNine PIs are currently approved for clinical use: first\ngeneration---saquinavir (SQV), indinavir (IDV), nelfinavir (NFV),\namprenavir (APV), fosamprenavir (FPV) and ritonavir (RTV), used only to\nboost all PIs except NFV, and second generation---lopinavir (LPV),\natazanavir (ATZ), tipranavir (TPV) and darunavir (DRV) \\[ 38 , 80 , 86\n\\]. PIs were designed to bind to the PR active site with higher affinity\nthan the natural substrates and fill more space inside the active site\ncavity. Resistance mutations in PR lead to an expansion of the active\nsite cavity, thereby reducing PI affinity to that region \\[ 87 , 88 , 89\n\\]. Second generation PIs were designed to surpass HIV-1 resistance to\nfirst generation PIs and to improve bioavailability, dosing frequency,\nand minimize side effects.\n\nDespite the structural similarities, HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases show\nmajor disparities in susceptibility to PIs. LPV, DRV, and SQV are the\nmost potent HIV-2 inhibitors while ATZ, NFV, APV and TPV demonstrate\nlower potency against HIV-2 and its use is not recommended \\[ 14 , 84 ,\n86 , 90 , 91 , 92 , 93 , 94 \\].\n\n### HIV-2 Resistance to PIs\n\nHIV-1 resistance to PIs occurs through amino acid substitutions in the\nbinding pocket of the PR or in a nearby site, and reduces the binding\naffinity of the PIs, ultimately resulting in failure in PR blocking \\[\n87 , 88 , 89 \\]. Resistance can also occur through the emergence of\nmutations in Gag-PR cleavage sites \\[ 95 \\]. In contrast with HIV-1,\nlittle is known about the role of resistance mutations in HIV-2 PR and\ntheir effects on viral replication.\n\nHIV-2 resistance pathways to PIs differ from those observed in HIV-1,\nwith V33I, K45R, V47A, I50V, I54M, T56V, V62A, A73G, I82F, I84V, F85L\nand L90M being the most important HIV-2 PI resistance mutations ( Table\n1 ) \\[ 26 , 96 \\]. I54M is the mutation most frequently observed in\nHIV-2-infected patients treated with PIs \\[ 71 , 75 , 93 , 94 , 96 , 97\n, 98 , 99 \\]. In phenotypic assays, this mutation confers high level\nresistance to LPV with a more than 10-fold increase in IC ~50~ compared\nto wild type virus \\[ 100 \\]. In HIV-1, this mutation only occurs under\nselective pressure with APV \\[ 101 \\]. I82F confers high level\nresistance to LPV (36.3-fold increase) in HIV-2 clinical isolates \\[ 100\n\\]. The acquisition of the I54M and I82F mutations may lead to\ncross-resistance to multiple PIs, including LPV \\[ 93 \\]. The\ncombination of resistance mutation V62A with natural polymorphism L99F\nconfers high-level resistance to LPV (124-fold) \\[ 100 \\]. In the\nreference HIV-2ROD isolate, the L90M mutation, which is a major\nresistance mutation to SQV and LPV in HIV-1 \\[ 102 \\], conferred\nresistance to SQV but did not alter the susceptibility to LPV \\[ 103 \\].\nThis mutation has been found in HIV-2-infected patients treated with\nSQV, IDV, RTV or NFV \\[ 75 , 97 , 98 , 104 , 105 , 106 \\], frequently in\nassociation with other mutations such as I54L/M, V71L, I82F or I84V \\[\n97 , 106 \\]. V47A is frequently found in HIV-2 patients failing\nLPV-based treatment \\[ 71 , 75 , 93 , 94 , 96 , 107 \\]. K45R and I64V\nwere also identified in HIV-2 individuals failing treatment with this\ninhibitor \\[ 93 \\]. In vitro, the V47A mutation confers a more than\n10-fold resistance to LPV and promotes cross-resistance to IDV, NFV and\nAMP \\[ 108 \\]. However, this mutation causes hypersusceptibility to SQV\n\\[ 93 , 107 \\]. For that reason, LPV is recommended in first-line\ntherapy and SQV in patients that fail a LPV-based regimen \\[ 44 \\]. This\nmutation causes no resistance to RTV, NFV, TPV and DRV \\[ 107 , 108 \\].\nOther mutations such as K7R, V62A/T and L99F are often present in\nHIV-2-infected patients treated with PIs but are rarely selected in\nHIV-1 infection \\[ 94 , 97 \\]. K7R was found in HIV-2 patients treated\nwith RTV, LPV or SQV, while L99F was found in patients treated with NFV,\nLPV, SQV or IDV \\[ 106 \\].\n\nIn summary, HIV-2 is intrinsically resistant to many PIs, and HIV-1 and\nHIV-2 show different pathways of resistance to this drug class.\nGenotypic drug resistance analysis is important when choosing the\nappropriate second line PI for HIV-2-infected patients failing a\nPI-based regimen.\n\n\n\n## 4. Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors\n\nIN is derived from the Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor and catalyzes the\nintegration of the provirus into the host cellular DNA through two\ncatalytic actions: 3′ processing and strand transfer \\[ 109 \\]. Each IN\nmonomer consists of three different domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD,\nHIV residues 1--49), catalytic core domain (CCD, residues 50--212), and\nC-terminal domain (CTD, residues 213--288) \\[ 109 \\]. The CCD domain\ncontains a conserved motif, catalytic triad (64D, 116D and 152E), which\nis crucial for the catalytic activity of IN.\n\nThe IN proteins of HIV-1 and HIV-2 share the same structure with 65%\nidentity at the amino acid level \\[ 110 \\]. Positions involved in the\nzinc binding domain, the CCD and the DNA binding domain, all crucial to\nenzyme function, are 100% conserved in HIV-2 \\[ 110 , 111 , 112 \\]. IN\nresidues in positions that are essential to DNA binding (Q148),\nintegration and replication (Q62, H67, N120, N144, Q148 and N155) in\nHIV-1 are also conserved in HIV-2 \\[ 111 \\].\n\nIntegrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) inhibit the strand\ntransfer step carried out by INs by binding to the active site of the\nenzyme and also by binding to divalent metals such as Mg ^2+^ required\nfor IN catalytic reactions, thus competing with residues located in the\nCCD \\[ 113 , 114 \\]. This process affects catalytic activity of IN and\ninhibits the joining of viral and cellular DNA (strand transfer\nreaction) \\[ 113 , 115 , 116 \\]. Five INSTIs were approved for clinical\nuse: the first generation raltegravir (RAL) and elvitegravir (EVG), and\nsecond generation dolutegravir (DTG), bictegravir (BIC) and cabotegravir\n(CAB) \\[ 38 \\].\n\nRAL was the first INSTI approved by the FDA for clinical use in HIV-1\ninfection in 2007 and is given once daily (1200 mg) or twice daily (400\nmg) in combination with two NRTIs \\[ 113 , 117 \\]. Soon afterwards,\nRoquebert et al. demonstrated that RAL was a potent inhibitor of HIV-2\nclinical isolates (IC ~50~ = 1.3--5 nM) \\[ 111 \\]. Damond et al.\nquantified the virological and immunological response to an ARV regimen\ncontaining RAL in two patients infected with HIV-2 with multiple drug\nresistances, high viral load (\\>6000 HIV-2 RNA copies/mL) and low T CD4+\ncounts (\\<25 cells/µL) \\[ 118 \\]. Viral load was undetectable after the\nsecond month of therapy and significant increases in T CD4+ cell counts\nwere observed and maintained for six months. More recently, in a phase 2\nnon-comparative trial, 87% of drug-naïve HIV-2-infected patients treated\nwith a RAL-based regimen achieved, at week 48, a viral load \\< 5\ncopies/mL and 40% of the patients gained \\> 100 CD4 T cells/µL \\[ 119\n\\]. Similar results were obtained in Spain, where undetectable viraemia\nwas achieved in 78% of treatment-naïve patients, with only two patients\nselecting the N155H resistance mutation \\[ 120 \\]. In this study,\nundetectable viraemia was also observed in 37% of ART-experienced\npatients, and 80% of patients presenting virological failure exhibited\ndrug resistance mutations. Overall, these reports showed that RAL was\neffective in suppressing viral load in drug naïve and most treatment\nexperienced HIV-2-infected patients. However, they also showed that\nRAL-resistance mutations emerge rapidly.\n\nEVG was approved for HIV-1 treatment in 2014 in a fixed-dose combination\n(Stribild, cobicistat-boosted EVG + FTC + TDF) given once daily \\[ 121\n\\]. In 2014, Zheng et al. also reported the successful use of Stribild\nin a drug-naive HIV-2-infected patient \\[ 122 \\]. This was consistent\nwith the potent activity of EVG in cell culture against a reference\nisolate (EC ~50~ = 1.6 nM) \\[ 76 \\] and clinical isolates from\nINSTI-naive patients (IC ~50~ = 0.3--0.9 nM) \\[ 111 \\]. A recent\nnon-randomized clinical trial in Senegal showed that a once-daily,\nsingle-tablet-regimen of Stribild is safe, effective, and well tolerated\nby HIV-2-infected patients \\[ 123 \\]. In this study, 28 of the 29\npatients (93.3%) who completed the 48 weeks follow-up had viral\nsuppression. Virologic failure occurred in one patient with a\nmultidrug-resistant virus.\n\nDTG, approved in 2013, has potent antiviral activity at 50 mg twice\ndaily in various combination regimens and shows limited cross-resistance\nto most RAL-resistant HIV mutants \\[ 124 , 125 , 126 \\], which is likely\ndue to a slower dissociation rate from mutant DNA relative to RAL and\nEVG, and an ability to adjust its conformation in response to structural\nchanges in the active site of IN \\[ 127 , 128 \\]. Several studies showed\nthat DTG is active against HIV-2 isolates from INI-naïve patients with\nan IC ~50~ range similar to that of HIV-1 \\[ 129 , 130 , 131 \\].\nConsistent with this, a recent retrospective observational study from\nIndia showed that most (86%) treatment-naive HIV-2-infected patients\nreceiving a DTG-based regimen achieved an undetectable viral load \\[ 132\n\\].\n\nDescamps et al. studied 13 HIV-2-infected adults failing a RAL-based\ntherapy who received DTG 50 mg twice daily \\[ 133 \\]. Patients with\nviruses with mutations Y143C/G/H/R at baseline achieved an undetectable\nplasma viral load, whereas patients with viruses with mutations in\ncodons 148 or 155 did not, indicating that mutations in these codons\nimpact DTG activity in HIV-2 \\[ 133 \\]. In Trevino et al. \\[ 134 \\], DTG\nwas prescribed for two patients failing a RAL-based therapy due to the\nN155H mutation, and both experienced a decrease in plasma viral load and\nan increase in the number of CD4+ T cells. However, viral rebound\noccurred in one patient after six months, indicating that N155H also\naffected DTG effectiveness.\n\nCAB, approved in 2021, is the first long-acting injectable INSTI to be\nused in combination with RPV as a substitute antiretroviral regimen in\nHIV-1-infected adult patients who are virologically suppressed \\[ 135\n\\]. Two studies have evaluated the activity of CAB against HIV-2\nisolates in cell culture. In the first study, performed with four\nisolates, Yoshinaga et al. reported a mean EC ~50~ of 0.12 nM \\[ 136 \\].\nIn the second, authors reported an average EC ~50~ of 1.8 ± 1.0 nM for\ngroup A isolates and 2.6 ± 1.3 nM for group B isolates \\[ 137 \\]. These\nresults suggest that CAB in combination with a second drug may be useful\nin the treatment of HIV-2 infection.\n\nBIC 50 mg daily is given as a fixed-dose combination with FTC and TAF\nfor the treatment of HIV-1 infection \\[ 138 \\]. Different cell culture\nstudies have shown that BIC is generally active against HIV-2 group A\nstrains with IC ~50~ in the nanomolar range, and also displays potent\nactivity against group B and AB recombinant isolates \\[ 131 , 139 , 140\n, 141 \\]. Mean instantaneous inhibitory potential (IIP) value of BIC at\nCmax was similar to the other INSTIs and was not significantly affected\nby resistance mutations, highlighting the potential of this drug to\ntreat HIV-2 infection. Clinical studies with BIC are therefore\nwarranted.\n\n### HIV-2 Resistance to INSTIs\n\nA recent meta-analysis showed that Q91R, E92A/Q, T97A, G140S, Y143G,\nQ148R, A153G, N155H, H156R and an R231 5-amino acid insertion are the\nmost frequent treatment-selected nonpolymorphic mutations in the\nintegrase ( Table 1 ) \\[ 26 \\]. As mentioned above, mutations Y143C,\nQ148K/R and N155H, with or without additional mutations (i.e., E92Q,\nT97A, G140S), have been associated with failure to most RAL- and\nEVG-based regimens \\[ 26 , 110 , 142 , 143 , 144 , 145 , 146 \\]. Three\nmain mutational pathways confer high-level resistance to RAL and/or EVG:\nY143C/G/H/R confers high-level resistance to RAL in combination with\nE92Q and to EVG in combination with T97A; and G140S/Q148H/K/R and\nE92Q/N155H confer high-level resistance to both drugs \\[ 14 , 131 , 145\n, 146 , 147 , 148 \\]. This extensive cross-resistance prevents the\nsequential use of RAL and EVG.\n\nAs for DTG, in reference isolate HIV-2ROD9, single or combinations of\nmutations E92A, E92Q, E92Q/T97A/A153G and I84V/E92Q/H157S were\nassociated with low level resistance (2.5- to 2.6-fold) \\[ 145 \\].\nRelated with this, one isolate from a patient failing a RAL-based\ntherapy with E92Q and T97A showed intermediate resistance to DTG \\[ 131\n\\]. Also, the combination of secondary mutations R263K and E92G led to\nthe loss of susceptibility to DTG in HIV-2-infected patients \\[ 120 \\].\nIn HIV-2ROD9, Y143C/G/H/R mutants were susceptible or slightly\nhypersusceptible to DTG, except for Q91R/E92Q/T97A/Y143G/A153S, which\nwas 7.6-fold resistant to DTG \\[ 145 \\]. Mutations at codon 148 alone\n(Q148K) or in combination with secondary mutations (G140A/S + Q148H/K/R)\nconferred 5.8- to 370-fold increases in EC ~50~ . The combination of two\nprimary resistance mutations, Y143H + Q148H or Q148H/R + N155H, resulted\nin moderate-to-high-level resistance to DTG. Consistent with the latter\nresistance pattern, patients failing RAL-based treatment due to\nresistance mutation N155H accumulate variants with mutations in codon\n148 (Q148K/R) when treated with DTG \\[ 133 , 149 \\]. Moreover, clinical\nisolates from RAL-experienced patients with mutations T97A/Y143C have\nshown a 7-fold increase in EC ~50~ for DTG, with G140S/Q148R a 13-fold\nincrease and with G140T/Q148R/N155H a 18-fold increase \\[ 130 \\].\nOverall, these results suggest that cross-resistance to DTG and RAL is\nhigh in HIV-2.\n\nSmith et al. have determined the antiviral activity of CAB against\nsite-directed mutants of HIV-1 and HIV-2ROD9 IN \\[ 137 \\]. For\nHIV-2ROD9, mutants E92Q + Y143C, E92Q + N155H, and G140A + Q148R were\n1.5-, 7.5-, and 6.9-fold more resistant to CAB, respectively.\n\nThe insertion of five amino-acids at position 231 of the C-terminal\ndomain of HIV-2 IN (231INS), corresponding to a repetition of upstream\namino-acids, renders high-level resistance to RAL (from 56 to 150-fold),\nmoderate-to-high-level resistance to EVG (from 8 to 149-fold),\nlow-to-moderate-level resistance to DTG (from 3.3 to 13-fold),\nlow-to-high level resistance to CAB (from 5 to 79-fold), and no or\nlow-level resistance to BIC (from 0 to 5.5-fold) \\[ 139 , 145 \\].\nRegarding resistance to BIC, a study with HIV-2ROD9 integrase mutants\nhas shown that G140S/Q148R and G140S/Q148H lead to 34- and 110-fold\nresistance to bictegravir, respectively \\[ 140 \\]. More recently, we\nhave shown that BIC activity was unaffected by combined mutations\nE92Q/T97A and E92A/Q148K that caused resistance to RAL and DTG \\[ 131\n\\]. The longer dissociation of BIC from integrase-DNA complexes may\ncontribute to the substantial activity of this drug against HIV-2\nisolates with resistance mutations to the other INSTIs \\[ 150 \\].\n\n\n\n## 5. Entry Inhibitors\n\nThree types of entry inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of\nHIV-1 infection, the fusion inhibitor (T-20), the CCR5 antagonist\n(maraviroc, MVC) and the CD4-binding monoclonal antibody (ibalizumab) \\[\n38 , 151 \\]. T20 exhibits reduced activity against HIV-2, showing up to\n100-fold higher IC ~50~ values in vitro relative to HIV-1 \\[ 152 \\], and\nis not recommended for HIV-2 infection. Other fusion inhibitor peptides\nare being studied and some have shown promising results. Peptide P3, an\nancestral peptide derived from helical region 2 in the transmembrane\nglycoproteins of HIV-2 and SIV \\[ 153 \\], potently inhibits both HIV-1\nand HIV-2 cell entry and replication (IC ~50~ of 63.8 nM for HIV-2 and\n11 nM for HIV-1) \\[ 153 \\]. It was not possible to select P3-resistant\nisolates in cell culture, suggesting a high genetic barrier to\nresistance \\[ 153 \\]. 2P23 is another promising short-peptide fusion\ninhibitor derived from HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV \\[ 154 \\]. This peptide was\nable to successfully inhibit HIV-1 isolates, T20-resistant HIV-1\nmutants, and a panel of primary HIV-2 isolates, HIV-2 mutants and SIV\nisolates. More recently, Xue et al. characterized two cholesterol\nmodified peptides derived from the transmembrane envelope region, LP-97\nand LP-98, as extremely potent inhibitors of HIV-1, HIV-2, SIV and SHIV\nisolates in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo in Rhesus monkeys \\[ 155 \\].\nComparing to T20, AZT and 3TC, LP-97 and LP-98 were more potent and\nbroader HIV-1 and HIV-2 inhibitors with impressive IC ~50~ values\n(\\~0.03 to 0.07 pM). LP-80 is currently in clinical trials ( NCT04592315\n) to access the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in\nHIV-1-infected patients without prior antiviral therapy.\n\nMVC binds to a CCR5 cavity within the two, three, six and seven\ntransmembrane helices (reviewed in \\[ 152 \\]). MVC binding induces\nconformational changes in the second extracellular loop of CCR5,\npreventing interaction with the surface envelope glycoprotein gp120 of\nHIV. MVC is only active against viruses with CCR5 tropism, and a tropism\ntest is mandatory before starting therapy with this inhibitor. There is\nample data on the activity of MVC against HIV-1 in cell culture, and MVC\nhas been successfully used in the treatment of HIV-1 infection \\[ 156 ,\n157 , 158 \\]. In contrast, there is limited data on the phenotypic\nsusceptibility of HIV-2 to MVC in vitro, and the use of this drug in\nHIV-2 infection remains to be explored. Three studies have shown that\nthe potency of MVC against HIV-2 isolates in cell culture is similar to\nHIV-1, with IC ~50~ values between 0.175 to 2.1 nM \\[ 159 , 160 , 161\n\\]. However, Borrego et al. demonstrated that MVC inhibits R5 HIV-2\nstrains with higher IC ~90~ values (IC ~90~ = 42.7 nM) than those\nobtained for HIV-1 (IC ~90~ = 9.7 nM), and also that inhibition of HIV-2\nR5 viruses from AIDS patients requires higher MVC concentrations than R5\nviruses from early infections \\[ 159 \\]. Consequently, higher doses of\nthis compound may be necessary in the treatment of HIV-2 infection.\n\nSo far, only two clinical studies have reported the use of MVC in the\nsalvage therapy of HIV-2 patients with limited therapeutic options \\[\n162 , 163 \\]. It was demonstrated that both regimens, MVC and RAL or MVC\nand Foscarnet, increased the T CD4+ cell count and decreased the viral\nload to undetectable levels \\[ 162 , 163 \\]. However, these clinical\ncases do not provide valuable information about the relative efficacy of\nMVC as salvage therapy in HIV-2-infected patients, since MVC was used in\ncombination with other antiretroviral drugs and a genotypic or\nphenotypic tropism test was not performed before treatment. In this\nregard, it should be noted that there is a genotypic online tool to\ndetermine HIV-2 coreceptor usage based on the V3 envelope sequence \\[\n164 \\].\n\nIbalizumab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, is a CD4-directed\npost-attachment inhibitor approved for the treatment of infection with\nmultidrug-resistant HIV-1 strains \\[ 151 \\]. Le Hingrat et al. recently\nevaluated the susceptibility of sixteen group A and B HIV-2 primary\nisolates to Ibalizumab \\[ 165 \\]. Results showed an inhibition of all 16\nisolates with a median IC ~50~ value of 0.027 µg/mL, which is in the\nrange of IC ~50~ observed for HIV-1. This data encourages the use of\nIbalizumab in patients with multidrug-resistant HIV-2.\n\n\n\n## 6. Lenacapavir\n\nLenacapavir (LEN), formerly GS-6207, is a recently FDA-approved,\nfirst-in-class, long-acting capsid (CA) inhibitor for the treatment of\nheavily treatment-experienced adults with multidrug-resistant HIV-1\nisolates \\[ 166 , 167 \\]. Lenacapavir can be administered subcutaneously\nup to every six months, minimizing pill burden and potentially improving\nadherence \\[ 166 \\]. It binds to the hydrophobic CA pocket formed by two\nadjacent CA subunits within the hexamer, stabilizing the CA core and\npreventing the binding of cellular cofactors (CPSF6 and Nup153) that aid\nviral nuclear import and integration of HIV \\[ 168 , 169 \\]. Lenacapavir\nalso interferes with Gag/Gag-Pol function and reduces the production of\ncapsid protein subunits \\[ 169 \\]. In cell culture, it has potent HIV-1\nantiviral activity in the low picomolar range (EC50 = 50--314 pM) \\[ 168\n, 169 \\].\n\nIn vitro resistance to LEN is associated with variants in the CA portion\nof Gag (L56I, M66I, Q67H, K70N, N74D/S and T107N) \\[ 167 \\]. These\nmutations appear to occur very rarely (\\<1%) in drug-naive patients \\[\n170 \\], in isolates from treatment-experienced patients \\[ 171 \\] and in\nisolates with resistance mutations to the other drug classes \\[ 172 \\].\n\nOnly one study has evaluated the activity of lenacapavir against HIV-2.\nLink et al. showed that GS-6207 was active against two HIV-2 isolates\n(CBL20 and CDC310319) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but\nless so compared to HIV-1 (mean EC50 = 885 pM) \\[ 167 \\]. More data are\nneeded on the antiviral activity of lenacapavir against primary isolates\nof HIV-2. There are no ongoing or planned clinical trials of lenacapavir\nin HIV-2-infected patients.\n\n\n\n## 7. Spiro-β-Lactams Are Potent Inhibitors of HIV-2 Infection\n\nSpiro-β-lactams are a new class of compounds with potent (nM) activity\nagainst HIV-1 (mean IC ~50~ of the lead compound BSS-730A = 14 nM) \\[\n173 , 174 \\]. More recently, we have shown that BSS-730A also has potent\nactivity against primary HIV-2 isolates from INI-naïve patients (mean IC\n~50~ = 18.10 nM) \\[ 131 \\]. Moreover, BSS-730A activity was unaffected\nby integrase mutations that confer HIV-2 resistance to RAL and DTG. The\nmechanism of action of these compounds is still unknown, but BSS-730A\ndisplays strong synergism with RAL and AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist \\[\n131 , 174 \\]. These compounds have yet to be tested in the clinic. In\nthis regard, the finding that the IIP value of BSS-730A is higher than\nthat of INIs highlights the potential clinical value of this compound \\[\n131 \\].\n\n\n\n## 8. Conclusions\n\nDeciding which therapeutic regimens to implement in HIV-2-infected\npatients is a challenge due to the limited number of effective drugs and\nthe limited number of treatment studies and clinical trials. An\nadditional problem is the low genetic barrier to resistance of HIV-2,\nthe limited understanding of resistant pathways, and the frequent\ncross-resistance between drugs from the same class. Investigational\ndrugs like azvudine, islatravir and BMS-986001, new generation fusion\ninhibitor peptides such as P3, 2P23, lipopeptides LP-97 and LP-98 and\nspiro-β-lactam BSS-730A are active against HIV-2 in vitro but in vivo\nstudies are needed to determine the usefulness of these drugs for HIV-2\ninfection. RAL and DTG show potent activity against HIV-2 and are\nincreasingly being used in first-line treatment regimens. BIC has yet to\nbe used in the clinic but its activity profile against RAL- and\nDTG-resistant isolates indicates that it should be useful for patients\nfailing therapy with these drugs. MVC appears to be an interesting\ntherapeutic option for R5 isolates, but its use is limited by the lack\nof clinical studies and the high cost. Clinical studies are needed with\nIbalizumab for the treatment of infection by multi-drug-resistant HIV-2\nisolates. Given the aim of curing and eradicating HIV infection as a\npublic health problem by 2030, studies on the activity of antiretroviral\ndrugs in HIV-2 replication in cell reservoirs such as macrophages and\ndendritic cells are urgently needed.\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThis work was supported by Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT),\nPortugal, Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN)---Portugal Collaborative\nResearch Network in Portuguese speaking countries in Africa (project\n332821690).

TAF is currently in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Phase 1 and 2 studies have shown that TAF was associated with increased peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) drug loading and increased suppression of HIV-1 replication compared to treatment with TDF. In this study, selection of in vitro resistance to both TAF and the parent compound, TFV, led to the emergence of HIV-1 with the K65R amino acid substitution in RT with 6.5-fold-reduced susceptibility to TAF. Although TAF is more potent than TFV in vitro, the antiviral susceptibilities to TAF and TFV of a large panel of nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant mutants were highly correlated (R2 = 0.97), indicating that the two compounds have virtually the same resistance profile when assessed as fold change from the wild type. TAF showed full antiviral activity in PBMCs against primary HIV-1 isolates with protease inhibitor, nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), or integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance but reduced activity against isolates with extensive NRTI resistance amino acid substitutions. However, the increased cell loading of TFV with TAF versus TDF observed in vivo suggests that TAF may retain activity against TDF-resistant mutant viruses.\nRationale: The paper describes the resistance selection experiments conducted with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and tenofovir (TFV).

We collected 444 pol , 152 vif , 129 env , and 74 LTR sequences from patients of the French ANRS CO5 HIV-2 cohort completed by 221 pol , 18 vif , 377 env , and 63 LTR unique sequences from public databases. We performed phylogenetic reconstructions and revealed two distinct lineages within HIV-2 group A, herein called A1 and A2, presenting non-negligible genetic distances and distinct geographic distributions as A1 is related to coastal Western African countries and A2 to inland Western countries. Estimated early diversification times for groups A and B in human populations were 1940 [95% higher probability densitiy: 1935--53] and 1961 [1952--70]. A1 experienced an early diversification in 1942 [1937--58] with two distinct early epidemics in Guinea-Bissau or Senegal, raising the possibility of group A emergence in those countries from an initial introduction from Ivory-Coast to Senegal, two former French colonies. Changes in effective population sizes over time revealed that A1 exponentially grew concomitantly to Guinea-Bissau independence war, but both A2 and B lineages experienced a latter growth, starting during the 80s economic crisis. This large HIV-2 genetic analysis provides the existence of two distinct subtypes within group A and new data about HIV-2 early spreading patterns and recent epidemiologic evolution for which data are scarce outside Guinea-Bissau.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility data.

We\nassessed levels of HIV drug resistance in children with virological\nfailure.\n\n### Methods:\n\nThis cross-sectional study, performed from March 2017 to March 2019 in\nSouth Africa, enrolled HIV-positive children aged ≤19 years, receiving\nART through public health facilities with recent evidence suggestive of\nvirological failure (at least one viral load ≥1000 copies/mL), across 45\nrandomly selected high-volume clinics from all nine provinces.\nResistance genotyping was performed using next-generation sequencing\ntechnologies. Descriptive analysis taking into account survey design was\nused to determine outcomes.\n\n### Results:\n\nAmong 899 participants enrolled, the adjusted proportion of HIV drug\nresistance among children with virological failure was 87.5% (95% CI\n83.0%--90.9%). Resistance to NNRTIs was detected in 77.4% (95% CI\n72.5%--81.7%) of participants, and resistance to NRTIs in 69.5% (95% CI\n62.9%--75.4%) of participants. Overall, resistance to PIs was detected\nin 7.7% (95% CI 4.4%--13.0%) of children.\n\n### Conclusions:\n\nHIV drug resistance was highly prevalent in paediatric patients failing\nART in South Africa, with 9 in 10 patients harbouring resistance to\nNNRTIs and/or NRTIs. PI-based regimens are predicted to be highly\nefficacious in achieving virological suppression amongst patients\nfailing NNRTI-based regimens. Scaling up resistance testing amongst\npatients would facilitate access to second- and third-line regimens in\nSouth Africa.\n\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study design and sample size criteria\n\nA cross-sectional facility-based study with retrospective record review\nwas conducted using a stratified cluster sampling approach. The study\ntargeted HIV-positive children aged ≤19 years who were receiving ART at\npublic health facilities across South Africa and had suggestive evidence\nof VF (defined as at least one recent VL test performed that was ≥1000\ncopies/mL). The sample size was determined assuming a prevalence of\nHIVDR of 80% among children with VL ≥1000 copies/ml, with prevalence\nassumed to be the same in all four age groups, 0--4, 5--9, 10--14 and\n15--19 years, a 95% CI, a precision level of 5%, and a design effect of\n1.5 for possible clustering of paediatric HIVDR at clinic level. The\nfinal sample size for the study was 1485 participants.\n\nAs the sample was stratified by province, a two-stage selection approach\nwas used. Firstly, 45 participating facilities were randomly selected\nbased on a historical record of having ≥100 specimens with VLs ≥1000\ncopies/mL from children or adolescents ≤19 years of age in 2014, as\nobtained from the National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS) Laboratory\nInformation Systems database, and between 2 and 18 sites per province\nwere then selected using the probability proportional to size. The\nnumber of sites that were selected from Eastern Cape (EC), Free State\n(FS), Gauteng (GP), Kwazulu-Natal (KZ), Limpopo (LP), Mpumalanga (MP),\nNorth West (NW), Northern Cape (NC) and Western Cape (WC) provinces was\n2, 1, 10, 20, 3, 4, 2, 1 and 2 respectively. Thirty-three specimens with\nVLs ≥1000 copies/mL were then required from each participating facility.\n\n### Participant identification and enrolment\n\nTo be eligible for inclusion in the study, the children had to be aged\n≤19 years, on ART for a minimum of 1 year (±3 months), and with\nsuggestive evidence of VF performed within the previous 6 months.\nParticipation in the study required consent from a responsible adult for\nall children aged less than 18 years, and children aged ≥7 years were\nrequired to assent into the study. Participants who had a regimen change\nfollowing their most recent VL test were not included.\n\nHealthcare workers (HCWs) at participating sites identified eligible\ncandidates through registers maintained at the participating facilities,\nand/or through the NHLS Weekly Result-for-Action reports, where\navailable. Once enrolled, the HCW completed the study data collection\nform that abstracted minimal clinical and sociodemographic data from the\npatient medical file and drew a fresh blood sample. Laboratory results\nwere returned to the participating clinic for patient management.\n\n### Blood specimen collection and HIVDR genotyping\n\nWhole blood was collected using standard phlebotomy methods into a 6 mL\nEDTA tube. A minimum of 500 μL plasma was ultra-centrifuged and total\nnucleic acid extracted using the MagNA Pure 2.0 automated extraction\nsystem (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). PCR amplification was\nperformed using an in-house method resulting in a single amplicon\nspanning 1.5 kb of *pol* encompassing the protease gene and the first\n250 amino acids of the reverse transcriptase gene (HXB2 2358--3882).\nAmplicon concentrations were adjusted to a final concentration of 0.5\nng/μL and libraries prepared using the 96-sample Nextera ^®^ XT DNA\nLibrary Preparation Kit (Illumina, USA). Quantified amplicons were\nsequenced using the MiSeq V3 sequencing Kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA).\nMiSeq FastQ files were analysed using DeepChek ^®^ (Advanced Biological\nLaboratories, Luxembourg, Luxembourg), and results were generated at a\n20% mutation detection threshold. In the event of PCR non-amplification\nor next-generation sequencing failure, a smaller amplicon was attempted\nas previously described ^19^ and sequenced using Sanger sequencing\ntechnologies. Consensus sequences were analysed using the Stanford HIVDB\nAlgorithm V8.8. Presence of HIVDR was defined as ≥1 drug resistance\nmutation associated with high-level resistance (HLR), intermediate-level\nresistance (IR) or low-level resistance (LLR) per genotype. Resistance\nto PIs, NRTIs or NNRTIs was limited to drug resistance mutations\nassociated with resistance to members of that drug class only (PIs:\nritonavir-boosted atazanavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir,\nritonavir-boosted lopinavir; NRTIs: abacavir, stavudine, didanosine,\nemtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; NNRTIs:\ndoravirine, efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine, rilpivirine.\n\n### Description of outcomes and key exposure variables\n\nKey variables collected included age, sex, weight, relationship of\ncaregiver, disclosure status, school grade, date of diagnosis, date of\nART initiation, current regimen, previous regimen, other medicines\ntaken, maternal and paediatric PMTCT received, current or prior TB\ndiagnosis, recent CD4 test results and recent VL test results. Time with\nvirological failure was determined as time between enrolment and most\nrecent VL, or time between enrolment and first VL result ≥1000\ncopies/mL.\n\n### Statistical methods\n\nThe sample was selected in two stages as described above. This approach\nprovided estimation of both the within- and between-clinic variability,\nwhich provided appropriate standard errors for 95% CI. Descriptive\nstatistics were presented using frequencies and proportions for\ncategorical variables and medians with corresponding IQRs for continuous\nvariables. All prevalence analyses accounted for the sample structure by\nstratifying by province, after weighting for survey design and\nnon-response at the site level (design weight/contribution weight). All\nanalyses were performed using the survey module in STATA, using the\nparticipating facility as the primary sampling unit. Significance was\nset at a *P* value of less than 0.05. All analyses were conducted using\nSTATA version 14 (STATA Corp., College Station, TX, USA).\n\n### Ethics\n\nThe protocol was approved by the Wits Human Research Ethics Committee\n(M151146). The protocol was also reviewed in accordance with the US CDC\nhuman research protection procedures and was determined to be research,\nbut CDC investigators did not interact with human subjects or have\naccess to identifiable data or specimens for research purposes (CGH;\n2016--290).\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Demographic characteristics of enrolled participants\n\nAt study closure, 1000 children had participated in the study. Of these,\n899 participants from 40 facilities from eight provinces (EC, FS, GP,\nKZ, LP, MP, NC and WC) were included in the study analysis, comprising\n61% of the anticipated sample size ( Figure 1 ). One hundred and one\nparticipants were excluded: 74 were excluded for incomplete study forms\nor missing data, 8 were \\>19 years of age, and 19 did not submit a blood\nspecimen or the specimen was haemolysed on receipt. The final number\nenrolled per province were 44, 33, 135, 455, 58, 107, 37, 0 and 30 in\nEC, FS, GP, KZ, LP, MP, NC, NW and WC, respectively. The adjusted median\nage of all participants was 12.9 (IQR 8.8--15.4) years and the median\nmost recent VL result was 24 594 (IQR 6020--99 994) copies/mL. Most\nparticipants were aged 10--14 (41%) or 15--19 years (28%); 18% were aged\n5--9 years and 14% aged 4 years or less. Participants had been failing\nART for a median of 1.0 (IQR 0.5--2.0) years. The majority were male\n(54.2%, Table 1 ) and attending primary school (46.8%). Two thirds of\nall participants were aware of their HIV status; not unexpectedly, these\nproportions varied across the age groups, with disclosure rates of 6.4%,\n30.1%, 72.9% and 93.6% amongst children 0--4, 5--9, 10--14 and 15--19\nyears, respectively. Just over half of all participants were cared for\nby a parent, the remainder were primarily cared for by grandparents or\nextended family members, whilst 2% were in a foster-care environment.\nDocumented PMTCT exposure was reported in 163/433 (37.6%) of\nparticipants, and almost two in five children reported previous or\ncurrent coinfection with TB.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nFinal enrolment study flow chart.\n\n\nA total of 418 children were receiving PI-based regimens, constituting\n48.4% (95% CI 41.4%--55.3%) of all participants after adjusting for\nsurvey design; the median age of these participants was 11.7 (IQR\n5.5--15.2) years, and the median most recent VL was 36 800 (7800--116\n200) copies/mL. The majority were receiving ritonavir-boosted\nlopinavir-based regimens (97.1%), whilst 2.9% were receiving\nritonavir-boosted atazanavir. The proportions of children aged 0--4\nyears who were receiving PI-based regimens was 83.5%, 47.1% of children\naged 5--9 years, 40.4% of children aged 10--14 years, and 44.7% of\nchildren 15--19 years.\n\nFour hundred and twenty-two participants were receiving NNRTI-based\nregimens \\[(45.0% (95% CI 38.2%--52.1%)\\]; the median age of these\nparticipants was 13.4 (IQR 10.5--15.6) years and the median most recent\nVL was 18 500 (IQR 4530-66 881) copies/mL. The majority were receiving\nefavirenz-based regimens (98.7%); seven participants were receiving\nnevirapine. Amongst children aged 0--4 years, 8.7% were receiving\nNNRTI-based regimens, and 47.0% of children aged 5--9 years, 52.4% of\nchildren aged 10--14 years, and 48.9% amongst children 15--19 years.\n\nA total of 55 (6.5%, 95% CI 3.8%--11.1%) participants were receiving\nNRTI-only-based regimens. These included lamivudine only ( *n* = 21),\nabacavir + lamivudine ( *n* = 18) and abacavir only ( *n* = 2), whilst\nthe remainder were combinations of zidovudine, lamivudine,\nemtricitabine, stavudine and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. The\nmedian age of these participants was 14.6 (IQR 9.1--15.4) years and the\nmedian VL was 27 670 (IQR 11 982--263 000) copies/mL.\n\n### Prevalence of HIVDR in children on ART with VF\n\nOf 899 specimens included in the analysis, genotyping PCR and sequencing\nwas successful in 809 (809/899, 90.0%), whereas 7 could not be sequenced\nand 83 specimens were not amplifiable by genotyping PCR.\n\nThe adjusted proportion of HIVDR among children on ART with VF was\ndetermined to be 87.6% (95% CI 83.2%--91.0%, Table 2 ). Resistance to\nNNRTIs was detected in 77.3% (95% CI 72.4%--81.6%) of participants, and\nresistance to NRTIs in 69.6% (95% CI 62.7%--75.8%). Dual-class NRTI +\nNNRTI resistance was detected in 59.4% (95% CI 52.5%--65.9%), and PI\nresistance was present in 7.9% (95% CI 4.5%--13.3%) of enrolled\nparticipants.\n\n\n### Prevalence of HIVDR in children on ART with VF by age group\n\nAdjusted prevalence of HIVDR did not vary across the four different age\ngroups \\[0--4 years: 89.5% (95% CI 76.6%--95.7%); 5--9 years: 87.8% (95%\nCI 80.4%--92.6%), 10--14 years: 86.5% (95% CI 78.0%--92.1%), 15--19\nyears: 88.3% (95% CI 82.4%--92.4%); Table 2 \\]. Resistance to pIs was\nmost prevalent in the 10--14 years age group \\[10.1% (95% CI\n3.9%--23.9%)\\], whereas resistance to NNRTIs was most prevalent in\nadolescents aged 15--19 years \\[82.4% (95% CI 75.6%--87.5%)\\]. Levels of\nNRTI resistance were highest in the younger age groups, notably amongst\nchildren aged 5--9 years \\[82.0% (95% CI 72.3%--88.8%, *P* = 0.0093)\\].\n\nThere was slightly higher levels of resistance amongst male\nparticipants; overall 55.2% (95% CI 49.4%--60.9%) of children with HIVDR\nwere male ( *P* = 0.8256). The proportion of children with HIVDR and\naged 0--4 years who were male was 49.9% (95% CI 31.4%--68.5%, *P* =\n0.5819); among children aged 5--9 years was 59.8% (95% CI 48.3%--70.4%);\namong children aged 10--14 years was 57.6% (47.8%--66.9%, *P* = 0.5800)\nand among children aged 15--19 years was 51.6% (95% CI 41.0%--62.1%, *P*\n= 0.2190).\n\n### Prevalence of HIVDR in children with VF by regimen\n\nAmongst participants receiving PI-based regimens, adjusted total HIVDR\nwas detected in 80.6% (95% CI 73.1%--86.4%, Table 3 ); resistance to PIs\nwas present in 11.5% (95% CI 6.4%--19.8%) of participants, resistance to\nNNRTIs was present in 60.9% (95% CI 54.4%--67.1%) and resistance to\nNRTIs in 65.1% (56.3%--73.0%). Amongst patients with PI resistance,\n29.3% (95% CI 12.8%--53.9%) exhibited LLR and 15.2% (95% CI 3.0%--50.6%)\nexhibited IR to darunavir.\n\nHIVDR was detected in 94.9% (95% CI 90.0%--97.4%) of participants\nreceiving NNRTI-based regimens ( Table 3 ), and resistance to NNRTIs was\ndetected in 94.1% (89.1%--96.9%). Resistance to PIs was present in 0.7%\n(95% CI 0.2%--2.1%) of participants and resistance to NRTIs in 74.8%\n(67.1%--81.2%). Notably, 74.1% (95% CI 66.5%--80.5%) of children\nreceiving NNRTI-based regimens harboured dual NNRTI + NRTI resistance;\nof these patients with dual NNRTI + NRTI resistance, 70.7% (95% CI\n62.0%--78.2%) exhibited HLR to both abacavir and efavirenz, whilst 25.4%\n(95% CI 19.1%--32.9%) exhibited HLR to efavirenz and LLR to abacavir.\n\nAmong the 55 participants receiving NRTI-based regimens, resistance to\nPIs was present in 29.2% (95% CI 8.1%--65.9%), resistance to NNRTIs was\npresent in 84.4% (95% CI 68.7%--93.1%) and resistance to NRTIs in 69.6%\n(95% CI 43.5%--87.2%). Overall, resistance was detected in 91.2% (95% CI\n78.4%--96.7%) of participants receiving NRTI-based regimens.\n\nAdjusted predicted resistance profiles \\[susceptible (S), LLR, IR or\nHLR\\] of the 809 genotypes obtained are shown in Figure 2 . More than\nhalf of children with VF harboured HLR to lamivudine + emtricitabine,\nirrespective of current regimen, whilst resistance to zidovudine and\ntenofovir disoproxil fumarate was infrequent. Resistance to abacavir\ndiffered by regimen; half of children failing an NNRTI-based regimen\nexhibited HLR to abacavir, whilst one in six children failing PI-based\nregimens harboured HLR to abacavir. Resistance to efavirenz and\nnevirapine was prevalent in most children, with cross-resistance to\nrilpivirine and doravirine in \\>50% of children failing NNRTI-based\nregimens. Etravirine showed the highest susceptibility profile, with\n60%--80% of all patients exhibiting susceptibility to etravirine,\nirrespective of current regimen. Patients with resistance to PIs showed\nhigh levels of susceptibility to darunavir.\n\nFigure 2.\n\nUnadjusted predicted resistance profiles amongst paediatric participants\nfailing ART, categorized according to current regimen in use ( *n* =\n805).

The most prevalent PI mutations detected were M46I (4.3%), I54V\n(4.0%) and V82A/C/T (4.1%).\n\nFigure 3.\n\nUnadjusted patterns of HIV drug resistance mutations in paediatric\nparticipants with virological failure, *n* = 809. Note: only mutations\npresent at ≥1.0% are depicted in this figure.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis national cross-sectional study showed that 9 in 10 children with VF\nin South Africa were failing with HIVDR and have been failing with HIVDR\nfor a substantial time. Resistance to the NNRTI drug class was most\nprevalent, but half of children failing ART were failing with resistance\nto NNRTIs and NRTIs. Resistance to efavirenz, nevirapine, lamivudine and\nabacavir was most prevalent, including amongst children receiving\nNNRTI-based and NRTI-based regimens. As NRTI and second-generation NNRTI\nregimen alternatives, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, zidovudine and\netravirine were predicted to be most efficacious for subsequent\nmanagement of children with HIVDR. Our study showed that PI resistance\nremains comparatively low, and PI regimens remain likely to be highly\neffective in achieving virological suppression amongst patients failing\nNNRTI-based regimens. However, amongst children that were failing\nPI-based regimens with resistance to ritonavir-boosted lopinavir and\nritonavir-boosted atazanavir, half exhibited susceptibility profiles to\ndarunavir, which is typically used as part of third-line regimens in\nSouth Africa.\n\nThe prevalence and patterns reported herein were similar to those in\nrecent reports. A recent study reported NNRTI resistance in 65.3%, NRTI\nresistance in 51.4% and PI resistance in 2.8% of 72 children living with\nHIV from five public health facilities in the EC province. ^16^ In this\nstudy, children aged between 0 and 12 years were monitored for 24 months\nbetween 2012 and 2014, and genotypes performed on children with VF. Data\nfrom KwaZulu-Natal collected during 2011--12 showed 82.2% and 86.3% of\nchildren aged ≤15 years failing NNRTI-based regimens, and 25.0% and\n62.5% of children failing PI-based regimens harboured resistance to\nNNRTIs and NRTIs, respectively. ^13^ A retrospective analysis of\nresistance patterns amongst 370 genotypes collected from children aged\n3--15 years and submitted for clinical management testing between 2009\nand 2012, showed that up to 33% of children failing PI-based regimens\nharboured PI resistance. ^12^ More recently, resistance to NNRTIs, NRTIs\nand PIs was reported in 65.2%, 60.8% and 5.8%, respectively, of 69\nspecimens collected from paediatric patients aged 2--10 years from two\nsites in LP province, between 2013 and 2015. ^15^ Our study reports\nresistance prevalence findings in the largest cohort of paediatric\npatients, with 809 specimens successfully sequenced, and collected from\neight of nine South African provinces, and shows that children failing\nART are highly likely to be failing with HIVDR, and that resistance to\nabacavir, lamivudine + emtricitabine, efavirenz and nevirapine is\nfrequently detected. As alternative regimens from this drug class,\nresistance to zidovudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was less\nfrequent, and that etravirine could be considered as an alternative\nsecond-generation NNRTI.\n\nThis study did not assess levels of resistance to the integrase strand\ntransfer inhibitors (INSTIs), as these regimens were not recommended for\nmanagement of paediatric HIV infection unless recommended for third-line\nART. Whilst INSTI-based regimens are predicted to be efficacious in\nchildren, ^20\\ --\\ 22^ limited evidence of dolutegravir efficacy in\ninfants and children with NRTI resistance exists. ^23^\n\nOf concern, the highest levels of resistance to all three drug classes\nwere reported amongst the 55 participants who were receiving NRTI-only\nbased regimens, also referred to as 'holding regimens'. These regimens\nare intended to provide partial clinical and immunological benefit\nwithout accumulations of additional resistance mutations, until full\nsuppression using alternative regimens can be obtained. ^24^ Most were\nreceiving lamivudine only, or lamivudine + abacavir. Twenty-one percent\nof these participants harboured resistance to PIs, and 63% harboured\nresistance to NRTI + NNRTI regimens. Extensive resistance has\naccumulated in these children by the time they are switched to holding\nregimens, and the predicted efficacy of alternative PI regimens is\nlower. However, these children may benefit from INSTI-based therapy.\n\n### Study limitations\n\nHigh-volume paediatric sites were included in the study. This approach\npossibly introduced bias to the study results, should there be\nsignificant differences in characteristics between high- and low-volume\nsites. In addition, participants were selected at the discretion of the\nsite HCW, with the intention to offer a resistance test when clinically\nwarranted. This survey did not necessarily recruit participants who were\nknown to be poorly adherent and who were possibly less likely to harbour\nresistance mutations. The study also used facility HIV care\nproviders/clinic staff to collect this data on the laboratory request\nform, in facilities where staff shortages are well documented. In many\nsites, recruitment was incomplete and subject to HCW availability to\nparticipate.\n\nThe survey was not successful in achieving the anticipated sample size,\nparticularly in certain provinces, primarily due to administrative\ndelays in obtaining permission to conduct the research at the respective\nfacilities, and reluctance of HCWs at sites to take on the additional\nstudy requirements. However, enrolment of clinics and participants was\nmore successful in EC, FS, KZ, MP and NC provinces, four of which have a\nvery high HIV burden. Therefore, these results are possibly not\nnationally representative. Complications in implementing nationally\nrepresentative HIVDR surveys have previously been described, leading to\nconsiderations for alternative laboratory-based surveillance strategies\nor targeted cohort studies. ^25^ To our knowledge, this study reports on\nHIVDR findings in the largest number of children to date.\n\n\n\n## Conclusions\n\nHIVDR is highly prevalent amongst children on ART and with viraemia in\nSouth Africa. Rapid change of regimen is critical after a second\nelevated viral load, given the predicted high efficacy of second-line\nand/or dolutegravir-based regimens. In addition, the implementation of\nroutine HIVDR testing for all paediatric patients with VF irrespective\nof regimen should be prioritized in national treatment programmes to\nassist in selecting optimal treatment regimens for these patients.\n\n\n\n\n### Funding\n\nThis project has been supported by the President's Emergency Plan for\nAIDS Relief (PEPFAR) through the US CDC under the terms of Cooperative\nAgreement to the National Health Laboratory Services, GH001631.

We performed ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) of protease, RT, integrase and gp105 regions. Only mutations in the HIV-2 ANRS list >1% were considered. HIV-2 tropism was assessed by V3 loop region UDS, and each read was interpreted with determinants of CXCR4-coreceptor use.\nResults\nAmong the 47 patients assessed, three displayed plasma viruses with a resistance-associated mutation (RAM) above the 20% detection threshold, all in RT, resulting in a prevalence of transmitted drug resistance for NRTI of 7.9% (95% CI 0.0%--16.5%). No RAM above the 20% detection threshold was found in protease or integrase. At the 1% detection threshold the transmitted drug resistance prevalence was 9.8% (95% CI 0.6%--19.0%), 13.2% (95% CI 3.5%--22.9%) and 4.5% (95% CI 0%--17.5%) for PI, NRTI and integrase inhibitors. The most prevalent MRV was the PI RAM I50V detected in three samples. Tropism analysis showed that 21% of patients (4 of 19) exhibited X4-tropic viruses: two in majority proportion and two in minority proportions (1.5% and 1.9%).\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of minority resistant variants (MRV) and resistance-associated mutations (RAM) in ART-naive HIV-2-infected patients using ultra-deep sequencing (UDS).

Genotyping was done on dried blood spot and/or plasma of participants with high HIV VL (≥1000 copies/mL). HIV genes (reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase) were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. The Stanford HIVDR Database was used for HIVDR interpretation.\nResults\nHIVDR genotyping was performed on blood samples from 137 participants (92 children and 45 adults) with VL ≥ 1000 copies/mL. The overall prevalence of HIV DRMs was 75.1%, with DRMs present in 78.4% of children and 57.8% of adults. Importantly, 5.8% of participants had INSTI DRMs including major DRMs: Q148K, E138K, G118R, G140A, T66A and R263K. NNRTI, NRTI and PI DRMs were also detected in 62.8%, 44.5% and 8% of participants, respectively. All the participants with major INSTI DRMs harboured DRMs targeting NRTI backbone drugs.\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

Dried blood spots were collected and tested for PDR.\nResults: A total of 315 sequences were available for analysis. The overall PDR prevalence rate was 18.4% (95% CI 13.8–24.3%). The prevalence of PDR to non‑nucleoside analog reverse‑transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was 17.8% (95% CI 13.6–23.0%) and of PDR to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) was 6.3% (95% CI 1.6–17.1%). The PDR prevalence rate among people reinitiating ART was 42.4% (95% CI 29.1–56.4%).\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of pre-treatment HIV drug resistance (PDR) and does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing or data.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 20345882\nQuestion ID: 1\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\nEvidence: HIV-1 drug resistance mutations in children after failure of first-line nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy. One hundred and twenty children were included in the study. Their median age (interquartile range) was 9.1 (6.8–11.0) years, the median duration of their NNRTI regimens was 23.7 (15.7–32.6) months, their median CD4 percentage was 12% (4–20%), and their median plasma HIV RNA at the time of genotype testing was 4.8 (4.3–5.2) log10 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL. The nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance mutations found were as follows. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence, predictors and patterns of genotypic resistance mutations in children after failure of World Health Organization-recommended initial nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based treatment regimens.\nRationale: The paper discusses genotypic resistance testing performed on HIV-infected children who experienced failure of NNRTI-based therapy.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence trend\nof transmitted INSTI drug resistance (DR) and to assess factors\nassociated with transmitted INSTI resistance among ART-naive PLWH over\nthe past decade.\n\nWe conducted a time-trend, single-centre study over the period 2009--19\non adult naive PLWH with a genotypic resistance test (GRT) performed\nbefore the ART initiation. GRT was determined by Sanger sequencing using\nan ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,\nCA, USA); we included in the analysis the immediate pre-ART GRT\navailable in people newly diagnosed with HIV infection.\n\nThe degree of resistance to each INSTI drug was calculated using the\nGenotypic Resistance Interpretation Algorithm of the Stanford HIV Drug\nResistance Database Program (version 9.1.1) (\nhttps://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-patterns/ ). The obtained scores\nwere used to classify the presence of low-level, intermediate or\nhigh-level resistance to each INSTI drug and to the INSTI drug class. DR\nwithin the INSTI class was defined by the presence of at least low-level\nresistance to ≥1 drug of the INSTI class.\n\nAll the considered characteristics were measured at or within 180 days\nbefore the GRT date.\n\nResults were reported as median (IQR) or frequency (%).\n\nCharacteristics of PLWH with at least low-level INSTI resistance or less\nthan low-level INSTI resistance were compared using the\nchi-squared/Fisher's exact test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\n\nThe Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess linear trend in transmitted\nHIV INSTI DR prevalence over time.\n\nA multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to determine\nfactors associated with at least low-level transmitted INSTI DR; given\nthe limited number of PLWH with transmitted INSTI DR. Three variables\nwere included into the model: age; CD4 cell count at GRT; and HIV-1\nsubtype.\n\nAll the statistical tests were two-sided at 5% level and were performed\nusing the SAS Software (release 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).\n\nOverall, 1223 ART-naive PLWH were evaluated: 1109 (90.7%) were male, 860\n(70.3%) were MSM and the median age was 37 (IQR, 30--45) years. Italian\norigin was found in 578 (78.0%) and 971 (79.4%) were infected by HIV-1\nsubtype B. CRF01_AE (74.0%) was the most frequent HIV-1 non-B subtype\nobserved. The median time to ART initiation was 2.9 (1.3--20.2) months;\nGRT was performed after a median time of 1.2 (0.5--2.9) months once\ndiagnosed with HIV infection and CD4 cell count at GRT was 416 (259--58)\ncells/µL.\n\nAt least low-level and at least intermediate INSTI DR were reported in\n18 (1.5%) and 6 (0.5%), respectively.\n\nMajor INSTI resistance mutations were uncommon; both E138K and R263K\nwere found in 2 (0.2%) people, while each of G118R, G140S, Y143C, Y143R,\nS147G and Q148H in 1 (0.1%) (Table S1 , available as Supplementary data\nat *JAC* Online). The most frequent accessory INSTI resistance mutations\ndetected were T97A in 19 (1.6%) PLWH, L74I in 12 (1.0%), E157Q in 11\n(0.9%) and G163R in 10 (0.8%).\n\nAmong PLWH with and without at least low-level INSTI DR, HIV-1 subtype\nnon-B was found in 8 (44.4%) and in 244 (20.3%) ( *P* = 0.018); G163K,\nan accessory INSTI mutation previously described as common in subtype\nnon-B viruses from ART-naive patients, was detected in 7/8 (87.5%).\nMoreover, subtype non-B infection proportion increased from 5% in 2009\nto 27.5% in 2019 ( *P* for trend \\< 0.0001).\n\nOverall, 1/10 (10.0%) of people with HIV-1 subtype B and 1/8 (12.5%) of\npeople with HIV-1 subtype non-B with at least low-level INSTI DR had a\nstrain resistant to more than one drug class. Overall, 51 (4.2%) PLWH\nhad a virus resistant to NRTIs, 47 (3.8%) to NNRTIs and 22 (1.8%) to\nPIs.\n\nPrevalence of at least low-level INSTI DR was anecdotal between 2009 and\n2013 and then gradually raised from 1.3% in 2014 to 3.9% in 2019 ( *P*\nfor trend \\< 0.001) prevalence of at least intermediate INSTI DR\nincreased from 0% in 2009 to 2% in 2019 ( *P* for trend = 0.188).

Recently, WHO has emphasized the need to fast-track the transition to dolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral (ARV) treatments. However, continued surveillance of INSTI resistance is recommended. In this study, clinical, epidemiological, and virological features associated with INSTI resistance diagnosed in Spain were analyzed. Samples collected between 2008 and 2021 from HIV-1-infected patients were analyzed in integrase, protease, and reverse transcriptase using Sanger population sequencing. ARV drug resistance was evaluated with the Stanford University HIVdb program. Among 2,696 patients, 174 (6.5%) had INSTI resistance, all of them to first-generation INSTIs, and 71 (2.6%) had also resistance to second-generation INSTIs. Of these, only 5 individuals were exposed to DTG as the only INSTI, in whom resistance development was associated with poor treatment adherence and/or resistance to other ARV classes. Of newly HIV-1-diagnosed individuals, 0.92% harbored INSTI-resistant viruses, with low prevalences maintained along time, and only one had low-level resistance to DTG. Persons who inject drugs, age over 39 years, resistance to other ARV classes, and longer time from diagnosis were associated with INSTI resistance (p < 0.001). Non-subtype B INSTI-resistant viruses lacked the Q148H + G140S resistance pathway and showed lower INSTI resistance levels than subtype B viruses. In conclusion, INSTI resistance is uncommon and associated with long-term infections, older age and additional resistance to other ARV drug classes, and is rare in newly diagnosed HIV-1 infections. Our results also support the preferential use of DTG-containing regimens in first-line treatments, although surveillance of INSTI resistance is encouraged.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the analysis of drug resistance mutations and their prevalence in patient samples, but it does not mention conducting in vitro drug susceptibility tests.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 33119663\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: At least one ARV drug was detected in samples from 36 (25.0%) of 144 participants (19/94 [20.2%] from Tanzania, 17/50 [34.0%] from the DR, Figs ​Figs11 and ​and3).3).

However,\nthe expansion of treatment has resulted in an increase in\nantiretroviral-resistant viruses, which can be an obstacle to\nmaintenance of successful ART.\n\nObjectives\n\nThis study analysed the genetic composition of the HIV near full-length\ngenome (NFLG) from archived proviruses of PLWH under successful ART, and\ndetermined the presence/frequency of drug resistance mutations (DRMs)\nand viral subtype.\n\nPatients and methods\n\nForty-six PLWH from Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and 40 from Rio Grande (RS) had\nproviral HIV NFLG PCR-amplified and ultradeep sequenced. The\npresence/frequency of DRMs were analysed in Geneious. Phylogenetic\nanalyses were performed using PhyML and SimPlot.\n\nResults\n\nAll samples included in the study were sequenced and 69 (80.2%) had the\nHIV NFLG determined. RJ and RS showed a predominance of HIV subtypes B\n(78.3%) and C (67.5%), respectively. Overall, 168 DRMs were found in 63\n(73.3%) samples, and 105 (62.5%) of them were minority variants. Among\nDRMs, 41 (39.0%) minority variants and 33 (52.4%) variants with\nfrequency above 20.0% in the viral population were able to confer some\ndegree of resistance to at least one drug in use by respective patients,\nyet no one showed signs of therapeutic failure.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur study contributes to the understanding of the impact of DRMs on\nsuccessful therapy and supports the sustainability of combinatorial ART,\nbecause all patients maintained their successful treatment despite the\nhigh prevalence of DRMs at low (62.5%) or high (37.5%) frequency.\n\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study population\n\nHIV-positive patients were recruited during their regular visits at\nHospital Federal de Ipanema (HI) and Hospital Universitário Clementino\nFraga Filho (HUCFF), both located in Rio de Janeiro (RJ; southeastern\nBrazil), and at Hospital Universitário Doutor Miguel Riet Corrêa Junior\n(HU-FURG) in Rio Grande do Sul (RS; southern Brazil). The inclusion\ncriteria for the study were: age ≥18 years; being on a first-line or\nsecond-line treatment regimen due exclusively to changes in the\ntreatment regimen recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health (and\nnot due to treatment failure or drug intolerance); and therapeutic\nsuccess (undetectable HIV viral load) for at least 12 months. Six\nmillilitres of whole peripheral blood was collected from all patients\nwho agreed to participate in the study and signed the informed consent.\nAll samples from RJ were collected between February 2016 and November\n2018, whereas all samples from RS were collected between August and\nDecember 2017. These samples were sent to Instituto Nacional do Câncer\n(INCA), Rio de Janeiro, where they were processed. Overall, 86 HIV+\npatients were recruited: 34 from HI, 12 from HUCFF and 40 from HU-FURG.\nOf those, 49 (34 from RJ and 15 from RS) have already been partially\ndescribed. ^\\ \\ 29\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 30^ However, this study included new samples\n( *n* = 37 patients) or additional HIV genomic information ( *n* = 19),\ntotalling novel data for 56 patients.\n\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committees of INCA (CAAE:\n52862016.9.0000.5274), HI (CAAE: 52862016.9.3002.5646), HUCFF\n(56604816.2.0000.5257) and HU-FURG (CAAE: 52862016.9.3001.5324).\n\n### DNA extraction and archived HIV proviral PCR\n\nAll samples were centrifuged to separate plasma and peripheral blood\ncells. PureLink ^®^ Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific,\nWaltham, MA, USA) was used to extract DNA from the blood cells\n(including the integrated HIV proviral genome), according to the\nmanufacturer\\'s instructions.\n\nNested PCR was used to amplify the HIV NFLG through three different\nstrategies ^\\ \\ 31--33^ or combinations thereof. All reactions were\nperformed in duplicates and visualized on a 1% agarose gel. Positive PCR\nduplicate products were pooled and purified with AccuPrep ^®^ PCR\nPurification Kit (Bioneer, Daejeon, South Korea), following the\nmanufacturer\\'s protocol. Products were then analysed on a 1% agarose\ngel and quantified in a NanoDrop ^®^ ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo\nFisher Scientific).\n\n### Genomic library construction and HTS\n\nThe purified PCR fragments were diluted to 0.4 ng/µL and pooled per\nsample for genomic library construction with the Nextera XT DNA Sample\nPreparation kit (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). ^\\ \\ 29^ Libraries\nwere quantified in Qubit 3 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and\nsequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform with a paired-end 2 × 251\nprotocol. PhiX Control v3 Library (Illumina, Inc.) was used as a control\nlibrary.\n\n### Data analysis\n\nSequence data were analysed on Geneious software v.9.1.8 (Biomatters\nLimited, Auckland, New Zealand) as described, ^\\ \\ 29\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 34^\nthrough reference-based assembly to the HXB2 reference sequence (GenBank\naccession NC_001802 ). Ten iterations were used during the assembly\nprocess in order to cancel the influence of the reference in the\nalignment product. The iteration consists of the first alignment being\nmade with the reference sequence and the remaining nine using the\nconsensus obtained in the previous step as reference. ^\\ \\ 32^\n\nAll samples were individually analysed to check the read alignment,\nexamine regions with low coverage (\\<1000 sequence reads) and\ninvestigate the presence of deletions, insertions and premature stop\ncodons.\n\nHypermutation was evaluated in consensus sequences through Hypermut 2.0\n(available at\nhttp://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HYPERMUT/hypermut.html) to\nidentify G--A changes consistent with apolipoprotein B mRNA editing\nenzyme, catalytic polypeptide (APOBEC) activity.\n\nViral tropism was determined with the Geno2Pheno algorithm (available at\nhttp://coreceptor.geno2pheno.org ) using a false positive rate cut-off\nof 10% for classification as CC chemokine receptor 5- (CCR5-) or\nnon-CCR5-using viruses. Only intrahost variants with frequency above 1%\nin the viral population were considered.\n\n### Phylogenetic analysis\n\nThe consensus sequence of each sample was extracted in Geneious using\nthe 75% threshold of correspondence with reads. Consensuses were\nanalysed with the Model Generator and PhyML v.3.0 softwares according to\nAlves *et al.* ^\\ \\ 29^ to classify the samples into HIV-1 subtypes\nthrough phylogenetic inference. Consensus sequences suggestive of\nrecombination were analysed in the SimPlot v.3.5.1 software through the\nBootScan Tool. Once recombination events were identified in Simplot\nsoftware, phylogenetic analyses were performed for each subtype region\nto support their classification.\n\n### Drug resistance mutation analysis\n\nThe presence and frequency of antiretroviral resistance mutations were\nevaluated through reference-based assembly according to the\nantiretroviral resistance annotations. ^\\ \\ 29^ The minimum variant\nfrequency considered in our study was 1%. Therefore, variants with\nfrequency between 1.0% and 20.0% in the viral population were considered\nminority variants, because variants with frequency greater than 20.0%\nare commonly detected by Sanger sequencing. ^\\ \\ 35--38^ The association\nbetween mutations identified and resistance to the ART currently in use\nwas evaluated for each patient. Mutations in reverse transcriptase,\nprotease and integrase regions were analysed through the HIV Drug\nResistance Database ( https://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-mutations ),\nwhereas mutations at the C-terminal regions of reverse transcriptase\n(RNaseH and connection subdomains) were manually analysed (Table S1 ,\navailable as Supplementary data at *JAC* Online) according to\ndescription in the literature. ^\\ \\ 39--46^ Transmitted drug resistance\nmutations (TDRMs) were defined according to the WHO classification.\n^\\ \\ 47^ Patients who had TDRMs associated with an antiretroviral class\nwith which they had never been treated were considered genuine TDRMs.\n\nThe raw sequencing reads were deposited to the Sequence Read Archive\nunder the BioProject PRJNA419915.\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Clinical profile of patients\n\nForty-six HIV+ patients from RJ and 40 HIV+ patients from RS were\nincluded in this study. Most patients in RJ (73.9%) were male, whereas\nmost patients in RS (62.5%) were female. The patients from both cities\nhad similar characteristics, like median age, time of treatment and\ntherapy initiation (from HIV diagnosis to ART start) (Table 1 ). Most\npatients (RJ, 76.1%; RS, 95.0%) reported being infected through sexual\ntransmission. The most prevalent therapeutic regimen combination used\nwas tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), lamivudine (3TC) and efavirenz\n(EFV) (TDF + 3TC + EFV), accounting for 55.8% ( *n* = 48) of patients\nincluded.\n\n\n### Molecular analysis\n\nAll 86 samples were successfully sequenced. Of them, 69 (80.2%; 41\npatients from RJ and 28 from RS) had their NFLG obtained. Despite the\nuse of different PCR amplification strategies, it was not possible to\nobtain NFLG from 17 samples, of which 9 had 75.0% of the proviral HIV\ngenome recovered, 7 had 50.0% and only 1 had 25.0% of the genome\nsequenced. Regarding the reference-based assembly, the median coverages\nwere 12 690 sequence reads (IQR ~50~ 7048.425--18 197.275) for sequences\nfrom RJ and 15 467 sequence reads (IQR ~50~ 11 222.275--18 375.625) for\nthose from RS.\n\nTwelve (13.9%; 12/86) hypermutated proviral sequences harbouring\nexcessive mutations consistent with the APOBEC3G/F signature were\ndetected. With respect to the intrahost viral tropism analysis spaning\nthe V3 *env* region, 255 unique viral sequences were found for this\nregion in the 86 samples analysed. Among them, 15 samples had only one\nviral sequence, whereas 28 samples had two different viral sequences\ncovering this region, 19 had three, and 24 samples had four or more\nviral sequences. Overall, 62 (72.1%) samples presented CCR5 tropism,\nwhereas the remaining 24 samples were classified as CXC chemokine\nreceptor 4 (CXCR4) or CXCR4/CCR5 dual viruses.\n\n### HIV-1 genetic diversity\n\nConsensus sequences were used for the construction of a maximum\nlikelihood phylogenetic tree for HIV-1 subtype classification. Sequences\ncomprising the NFLG ( *n* = 69) are represented in Figure 1 . We\nobserved a prevalence of samples classified as subtype B in samples from\nRJ, and as subtype C among samples from RS, in addition to several\nrecombinant forms in both cities.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nMaximum likelihood phylogenetic tree containing all 69 samples that had\nthe HIV-1 near full-length proviral genome sequenced.

Seventy-two (83.7%)\nof them had all four regions analysed, whereas five samples had three\ngenomic regions, two samples had two, and seven samples had only one\n(Table S2 ). Of the 168 mutations found, 50 mutations (29.8%; 25/75\npatients analysed for this region) were present in the protease region,\n101 mutations (60.1%; 51/77 patients) were found in the reverse\ntranscriptase, 14 mutations (8.3%; 13/76 patients) in the integrase\nregion and 3 mutations (1.8%; 3/86 patients) in the envelope.\n\nSixty-three samples (73.3%) carried viruses with antiretroviral\nresistance mutations, despite the therapeutic success maintained for all\npatients. Some samples, such as 3-HI, did not have any mutation\nassociated with antiretroviral resistance, whereas others, such as\n24-FURG, had up to eight mutations across the HIV genome (Table S2 ).\nWith respect to the intrahost prevalence of mutations, most of them (\n*n* = 105) were found as minority variants. We could also observe that,\namong the 63 mutations with frequency above 20.0% and the 105 minority\nvariants, 33 (52.4%) and 41 (39.0%) mutations, respectively, were able\nto confer some degree of resistance to at least one drug currently in\nuse by respective patients (underlined mutations, Table S2 ). We also\nfound 51 mutations that confer resistance to drugs that were not in use\nby patients, and 34 of them were minority variants (Figure 3 ).\n\nFigure 3.\n\nFrequency, HIV genomic location and respective subtype classification\nfor DRMs found in the studied population.

The most\nprevalent was the combination using NNRTI (72.1%; 62/86 patients)\nfollowed by use of PI-based regimens (27.9%; 24/86). We found a higher\nfrequency of mutations able to confer resistance to NRTIs (33.9%;\n57/168), followed by NNRTIs (29.8%; 50/168) and PIs (29.2%; 49/168). We\nevaluated the presence of DRMs (total or only those above 20.0% in the\nviral intrahost population) between the two patient groups above, but\nneither was significantly different (data not shown).\n\nRegarding the DRMs found in our study, four mutations (M184IV-RT,\nK65R-RT, G190E-RT and N88S-PR), present in 24 patients, are able to\nconfer high-level resistance to the current treatment of respective\npatients (highlighted in bold, Table S2 ). Eighteen patients carried the\nM184IV mutation, able to confer a high level of resistance to\nlamivudine, currently in use by all those patients. However, this\nmutation had a frequency above 20.0% at the viral quasispecies in only\nseven patients (range 20.1% to 99.9%). Another five patients had the\nK65R mutation, associated with a high level of resistance to tenofovir\ndisoproxil fumarate, included in the therapeutic regimen of those\npatients. In this case, all these mutations were present as minority\nvariants (range 1% to 7.7%). Two other mutations, G190E (in two\npatients, able to confer a high level of resistance to efavirenz) and\nN88S \\[in one patient, conferring a high level of resistance to\natazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r)\\], were also found as minority variants\n(range 3.7% to 14.9%).\n\nThirteen TDRMs were present with a frequency above 20.0% in the viral\npopulation, and 30 as minority variants (italicized mutations, Table S2\n). These mutations were distributed in 26 (30.2%; 26/86) patients. Some\nsamples, such as 6-HUCFF, had only one TDRM, whereas others, such as\n30-FURG, had up to eight TDRMs.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nDespite several benefits associated with the use of antiretrovirals for\nHIV treatment, such expansion in usage has led to an increase in\nantiretroviral-resistant viruses, reducing therapeutic options and\nrepresenting a major public health concern. ^\\ \\ 47\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 48^ Our\nstudy aimed to identify mutations associated with antiretroviral\nresistance, including minority variants, present in archived proviruses\nof patients with prolonged undetectable viral load.\n\nThe studied patients started ART about 1 year after their diagnosis\n(median time of 1.2 years for RJ patients and 0.9 years for RS\npatients). The predominant antiretroviral combination used by our\npatients was TDF + 3TC + EFV, corresponding to 55.8% of our cohort.\nUntil 2016, this combination was the first-line treatment recommended by\nthe WHO. ^\\ \\ 49^ Since 2017, the Brazilian Ministry of Health has\nrecommended a first-line treatment composed of TDF + 3TC + dolutegravir\n(DTG). ^\\ \\ 50^ Because all patients in our study started treatment\nbefore 2017, the predominance of the TDF + 3TC + EFV therapeutic regimen\ncorroborates the recommended scheme at that time.\n\nHIV-1 subtype B is the predominant subtype in Latin America. ^\\ \\ 51^\nEpidemiological studies conducted in Brazil have shown a similar\npattern. ^\\ \\ 52--56^ However, in the South region of Brazil subtype C\npredominates. ^\\ \\ 30\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 54\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 55\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 57\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 58^ As\nexpected, most of our samples from RJ (southeast region) belonged to\nsubtype B (78.3%; 36/46), whereas most samples from RS (south region)\nbelonged to subtype C (67.5%; 27/40).\n\nAltogether, almost 20.0% of our samples were classified as recombinant\nforms. Other studies show a lower prevalence of recombination, ranging\nfrom 1.8% to 11.6%. ^\\ \\ 59--64^ However, those studies did not\ndetermine NFLG sequences, i.e. they determined the viral subtype only\nfrom partial genomes. The NFLG amplification associated with HTS\nsupports the higher prevalence of recombinant forms seen herein.\n\nOur study also evaluated the presence and frequency of\nantiretroviral-associated resistance mutations in the archived\nproviruses. Most studies only evaluate mutations found in circulating\nviruses present in blood plasma. ^\\ \\ 34\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 62\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 64--71^ A\nstudy by Zaccarelli *et al.* ^\\ \\ 72^ identified antiretroviral\nresistance mutations present in PBMCs and in blood plasma of the same\npatients, and showed that in 20.1% of the samples resistance mutations\nwere detected only in PBMCs. Also, the presence of those mutations is\nusually investigated in a scenario of therapeutic failure,\n^\\ \\ 13\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 24\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 34\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 65\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 70\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 73\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 74^\nand not in the PBMC reservoir of patients under therapeutic success, as\na potential source of rebound viruses. A Brazilian study performed by\nCorado *et al.* ^\\ \\ 75^ showed that 63% of patients with an\nundetectable viral load carried antiretroviral resistance-associated\nmutations.\n\nAmong the resistance mutations found in our study, 63 had a frequency\nabove 20.0% in the viral population, whereas 105 were minority variants.\nStandard genotypic resistance tests are usually performed through Sanger\nsequencing. ^\\ \\ 35--38^ This is able to detect only variants with\nfrequency above 20.0% in the intrahost viral population. On the other\nhand, HTS technologies are able additionally to detect minority\nvariants. A study performed by Arias *et al.* ^\\ \\ 14^ compared Sanger\nand HTS for the detection of antiretroviral resistance mutations and\nobserved that both techniques have a high correlation in the detection\nof variants with a frequency above 20.0%. However, only HTS was able to\ndetect minority variants. Other studies have also performed comparisons\nand concluded that HTS is more sensitive, more effective and currently\nhas a lower cost per sequence than Sanger sequencing.\n^\\ \\ 15\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 16\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 76--78^ Thus, the higher proportion of\nminority variant mutations (62.5%; 105/168) found in our study is\nrelated to the sensitivity of the sequencing methodology used.\n\nDespite the several mutations identified, including mutations able to\nconfer high levels of resistance to ART currently in use by the\npatients, all subjects were in therapeutic success at the time of their\ninclusion in our study. Dalmat *et al.* ^\\ \\ 79^ observed that, despite\nthe resistance mutations found in their cohort, all virological failures\nwere related to poor adherence to treatment. During the recruitment of\nour patients, all of them reported good adherence, which may be\nassociated with the high rate of therapeutic success. In addition, the\ntherapeutic regimen of all patients consisted of three different\nantiretroviral drugs, which in combination can maintain undetectable\nviral loads even when one of the drugs is not active.\n\nThe high frequency of drug-resistant minority variants (62.5%; 105/168\nmutations) highlights the relevance of monitoring these mutations and\ntheir impact on ART in patients under therapeutic success. Despite some\nstudies having shown an association between the presence of minority\nvariants and therapeutic failure,\n^\\ \\ 17\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 19\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 20\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 23--25^ particularly for NNRTI\nminority resistance variants, ^\\ \\ 17\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 19\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 22\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 23^\nthese variants did not lead to therapeutic failure in our study.\nHowever, future studies should investigate their longitudinal\npersistence and their long-term effect on ART. In this sense, we plan to\nevaluate the intrahost DRMs frequency through new collection points to\nunderstand their effect on treatment outcomes.\n\nOf the 168 mutations found in our cohort, 43 (25.6%) were TDRMs present\nin 26 (30.2%; 26/86) patients. Studies generally show a lower prevalence\nof TDRMs, ranging from 13.5% to 19.2%. ^\\ \\ 12\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 80--82^ A study\nperformed by Moscona *et al.* ^\\ \\ 83^ compared HTS and Sanger\nmethodologies for the detection of TDRMs and observed a rate of 31.3% of\nthe patients through HTS, compared with only 8.8% of patients by Sanger.\nOf the 43 TDRMs found in our study, 30 (69.8%) were minority variants.\nTherefore, the higher prevalence of TDRMs found in our study reflects\nthe use of a more sensitive technique that captured mutations at low\nfrequency. However, the impact of minority TDRMs on treatment is\nuncertain. A longitudinal follow-up of our cohort may be necessary to\nevaluate their influence on ART efficacy.\n\nRegarding the 51 mutations not associated to the treatment currently in\nuse by the study patients and not classified as TDRMs, they could have\nbeen transmitted during viral infection, despite not being classified as\nTDRMs by Bennett *et al.* ^\\ \\ 47^ Because we did not sequence these\nsamples before treatment, we cannot be certain regarding this\nhypothesis. Alternatively, these mutations could have emerged randomly\nand conferred some advantage to the virus, i.e. viral fitness, which\nincreased their frequency in the patients' viral quasispecies.\n\nAmong the limitations found in our study, we can highlight the small\nnumber of patients included. We evaluated a restricted population with\nstrict inclusion criteria, which prevented us from building a large\ncohort. Another limitation was the difficulty in amplifying different\nviral genomic regions by PCR from PBMC reservoirs, despite several\nattemps to amplify each viral genomic region. This could be because we\namplified the proviruses archived from samples that have an undetectable\nviral load, and very low numbers of viral copies are usually present in\nthis compartment. Mismatches between the primers used and sequence\ndiversity of the HIV isolates studied may have also played a role in\nsome of the unsuccessful PCR attempts.\n\nOur study stands out for analysing the archived proviruses of patients\nwho have an undetectable viral load, a population poorly discussed in\nthe literature and with a great relevance to understanding the obstacles\ninvolved in the maintenance of successful treatment. By using an NFLG\namplification methodology, we were able to determine bona fide viral\ngenetic forms, contributing to the enrichment of Brazilian HIV molecular\nepidemiology data. In addition, due to the use of HTS, we were able to\ndetermine the presence of minority resistance-associated mutants, which\ncontributes to understanding the influence of these variants in patients\nwho are in therapeutic success and the sustainability of antiretroviral\ntreatment.\n\n\n## Funding\n\nThis work was supported by the Brazilian Research Council (CNPq) grant\nno. 309850/2020-7 (to M.A.S.), by Merck Sharp & Dohme Avenir grant \\#\nDS-2016-0005 (to M.A.S.) and by Rio de Janeiro State Science Foundation\n(FAPERJ) grant no. 260003/001581/2022 (to B.M.A.).\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 20029816\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: To examine the efficacy of these drugs in Cameroon, where diverse non-B HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant viruses predominate, the reverse transcriptase (RT) viral sequences in patient plasma were analyzed for the presence of mutations that confer drug resistance. Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon.\nRationale: The paper doest not mention in vitro drug susceptibility data or phenotypic data.

All patients with intermediate-level resistance to DTG had DRMs to NNRTI and NRTI, which were M184V and K103N in two of them. Four of 5 patients with DTG resistance had poor therapeutic adherence (as assessed by their physicians when the sample was sent for resistance testing) and in the fifth, the treatment regimen had been changed after renal failure.\"\nRationale: The paper discusses the presence of drug resistance mutations in patients with treatment, indicating that sequences were obtained from such individuals.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 29415189\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Patients and methods\nART-naive HIV-2-infected patients with detectable plasma viral load (>100 copies/mL) included in the ANRS HIV-2 CO5 Cohort were assessed. We performed ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) of protease, RT, integrase and gp105 regions. Only mutations in the HIV-2 ANRS list >1% were considered. HIV-2 tropism was assessed by V3 loop region UDS, and each read was interpreted with determinants of CXCR4-coreceptor use.\nResults\nAmong the 47 patients assessed, three displayed plasma viruses with a resistance-associated mutation (RAM) above the 20% detection threshold, all in RT, resulting in a prevalence of transmitted drug resistance for NRTI of 7.9% (95% CI 0.0%--16.5%). No RAM above the 20% detection threshold was found in protease or integrase. At the 1% detection threshold the transmitted drug resistance prevalence was 9.8% (95% CI 0.6%--19.0%), 13.2% (95% CI 3.5%--22.9%) and 4.5% (95% CI 0%--17.5%) for PI, NRTI and integrase inhibitors. The most prevalent MRV was the PI RAM I50V detected in three samples. Tropism analysis showed that 21% of patients (4 of 19) exhibited X4-tropic viruses: two in majority proportion and two in minority proportions (1.5% and 1.9%).\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of minority resistant variants (MRV) and resistance-associated mutations (RAM) in ART-naive HIV-2-infected patients using ultra-deep sequencing (UDS).

This study was done to assess the long-term survival, and\nvirological and mutational outcomes of people living with HIV receiving\nthird-line ART between July 2016 and December 2019 in an ART centre in\nIndia.\n\nMethods\n\nEighty-five patients were started on third-line ART. Genotypic\nresistance testing to identify drug resistance mutations in the\nintegrase, reverse transcriptase and protease genes was done at the\nstart of third-line therapy, as well as in those who did not attain\nvirological suppression after 12 months of therapy.\n\nResults\n\nSurvival was 85% (72/85) at 12 months and 72% (61/85) at the end of\nfollow-up in March 2022. Virological suppression was present in 82%\n(59/72) and 88% (59/67) at 12 months and at the end of follow-up,\nrespectively. Five out of 13 patients who had virological failure at 12\nmonths showed virological suppression at the end of the study. At the\nstart of third-line therapy, 35% (14/40) and 45% (17/38) of patients had\nmajor integrase- and protease-associated mutations, respectively, even\nthough they had never been on integrase inhibitor-based regimens. At 1\nyear follow-up, among those failing third-line therapy, 33% (4/12) of\npatients had major integrase mutations, but none had major protease\nmutations.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis study demonstrates good long-term outcome in patients on\nstandardized third-line ART in programmatic conditions with very few\nmutations in those failing the therapy.\n\n\n## Materials and methods\n\nThis single-centre observational study was done at a CoE in HIV care,\nBanaras Hindu University (BHU) in a tertiary hospital in Varanasi,\nIndia. CoE, BHU has one of the largest ART centres in the eastern part\nof the country, serving 4550 PLHIV from states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,\nMadhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. The study was approved by the Ethics\nCommittee of the Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University\n(No. Dean/2015-16/EC/413 and No. Dean/2018/EC/715).\n\n### Study population\n\nPatients failing second-line therapy from the National AIDS Control\nOrganization (NACO)-funded ART centres of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are\nreferred to the State AIDS Clinical Expert Panel (SACEP) in CoE BHU for\ninitiation of third-line therapy.\n\nAll PLHIV who were started on third-line ART between July 2016 and\nDecember 2019 in the ART centre were included in the study. The criteria\nfor starting third-line therapy were patients on second-line therapy\nwith plasma viral load (VL) \\> 1000 copies/mL on two occasions.\n\nInformation on demographics, clinical status, opportunistic infection,\nprevious ART regimen, CD4 count, VL and other laboratory parameters were\nabstracted from white card available at the ART centre.\n\nVL was done on the HIV viral load assay platform Abbot Molecular System\n(detection level 150 copies/mL) at 6 monthly intervals as per\nguidelines. Patients with VL \\> 1000 copies/mL were put on step-up\nadherence counselling and VL was repeated at 3 months. Virological\nfailure was defined as plasma VL \\> 1000 copies/mL on two occasions.\nGenotypic resistance testing to identify DRMs in the integrase (IN),\nreverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR) genes was done at the start\nof third-line therapy as well as in those who did not attain virological\nsuppression after 12 months of therapy. Drug regimens were not modified\naccording to the genotyping results. Patients visited the CoE every\nmonth to collect their medication. Those patients who did not come for\nthree consecutive months at the ART centre were labelled as lost to\nfollow-up (LFU) at the end of the fourth month, as per NACO guidelines.\nAdherence was calculated on the basis of pill count at every visit. For\nanalysis we compared those with \\>95% adherence at every visit with\nthose with \\<95% at any visit.\n\nPatients were routinely followed up in the ART centre and long-term\nsurvival and virological outcome was assessed in March 2022.\n\n### Sample collection and processing\n\nWhole blood was collected from patients into EDTA tubes and used for CD4\nestimation; in parallel, plasma was separated following centrifugation\nat 2000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min and stored at −80°C until viral RNA\nisolation. The CD4 T cell counts for all these patients were performed\nusing the BD FACSCount system (Becton, Dickinson).\n\n### Nucleic acid extraction\n\nThe HIV RNA was extracted manually using a QIAamp ^®^ Viral RNA mini kit\naccording to the manufacturer's instructions (QIAGEN, Germany; Cat No.\n52906). Viral RNA was stored at −80°C until use.\n\n### Amplification of RT and PR genes\n\n#### RT--PCR\n\nAmplification of complete PR (codons 1 to 99) and partial RT (codons 1\nto 256) regions of the *pol* gene was performed by a previously\npublished method. ^\\ \\ 10\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 11^ Synthesis of cDNA and PCR was\nperformed using the ThermoScript RT PCR System (Invitrogen; Cat No.\n1146016) with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen; Cat No.\n10966018). cDNA was synthesized in a 20 µL reaction mixture using\nThermoScript RT enzyme and primer (5′-GGATAAATCTGACTTGCCCART-3′, HxB2\nposition; 3343). The thermal cycling conditions were 65°C for 5 min for\ndenaturation followed by RT incubation (42°C for 15 min and 50°C for 15\nmin). After cDNA was synthesized, we used Platinum Taq polymerase enzyme\nand two outer primers (5′-GGATAAATCTGACTTGCCCART-3′, HxB2 position 3343;\nand 5′-AGGAAG GACACCARATGAARGA-3′, HxB2 position 2042) for the first\nround of PCR using a 50 µL reaction mixture. Thermal cycling conditions\nfor the first round of PCR were initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min,\nfollowed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 50°C for 20 s and 72°C for 60 s;\nthe final elongation step was done at 72°C for 5 min.\n\n#### Nested PCR\n\nThe second round of PCR was performed using a 50 µL volume of reaction\nmixture, the same as the first-round PCR reaction mixture and two inner\nprimers (5′-GCTTCCCTCARATCACTCTT-3′, HxB2 location 2248; and\n5′-CCACTAAYT TCTGTA TRTCATTGAC-3′, HxB2 location 3309) with an expected\nfragment size of 1086 bp. Amplification started with initial\ndenaturation at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at\n94°C for 20 s, annealing at 50°C for 20 s and elongation at 72°C for 60\ns. The final elongation step was done at 72°C for 5 min and products\nwere stored at 4°C until further use.\n\n### HIV-1 integrase gene amplification\n\nAmplification of the HIV-1 IN gene was carried out by following the\nmethod used by Sachithanandham *et al.* ^\\ \\ 12^ in 2016.\n\n### Sequencing\n\nSamples were processed after gel purification using the QIAquick gel\nextraction kit (Cat. No. 28704). Sequencing was done by a third-party\ncommercial organization (Medauxin) using an Applied Biosystem 3730xl DNA\nAnalyzer.\n\n### Sequence analysis and subtyping\n\nFollowing sequencing, we used the Recall software to build a contig\nusing https://recall.bccfe.ca/ and the drug resistance pattern was\ndetermined by the Stanford University HIV Genotypic Resistance\nInterpretation Algorithm version 9.0 (\nhttps://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-mutations/ ). HIV-1 subtyping was\nperformed on all of the samples in accordance with the recommendations\nof the REGA HIV-1 subtyping tool version 3.0 (\nhttp://dbpartners.stanford.edu:8080/RegaSubtyping/stanford-hiv/typingtool/\n).\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nThe statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the\nSocial Sciences (SPSS, Version 23.0; IBM Corp., NY, USA). Descriptive\nstatistics were used---mean ± SD for quantitative variables, and\nfrequency with percentage distribution for categorized variables. For\ncategorical variables, chi-squared and Fischer's exact tests were used,\nand for comparing two groups of mean or median, Student's *t* -test and\nMann--Whitney *U* -test were used. Probability of significance ( *P*\nvalue) of  ≤0.05 was considered as statistically significant. A\nmultivariate analysis was done to assess the predictors of death in\nthird-line patients using the binary logistic regression model,\nincluding all variables that were associated with the outcome ( *P*\n\\< 0.05) in univariate analysis.\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Baseline characteristics\n\nEighty-seven patients were started on third-line ART between July 2016\nand December 2019. Out of the 87 patients, 2 were initiated on\nthird-line therapy from a private clinic and were not on the\nstandardized third-line treatment recommended by the programme, thus\nonly 85 patients were included in the analysis. The baseline\ncharacteristics (at the time of diagnosis of second-line failure) of the\n85 patients initiating third-line ART are summarized in Table 1 . The\nmean age at initiation of third-line ART was 40.98 ± 10.25 years, and\n74% were male. The mean duration of first-line and second-line ART\ntreatment was 56.52 ± 34.16 and 36.93 ± 22.37 months, respectively, and\nthe mean duration of third-line ART was 42.08 ± 18.82 months. The median\nCD4 count and VL at third-line ART initiation were 267 (IQR 175--402.5)\ncells/mm ^\\ \\ 3^ and 37 593 (IQR 6870.50--194876.50) copies/mL,\nrespectively. Four patients had TB at the start of treatment.\n\nAt the time of the start of this study, the initial regimen for\nthird-line therapy was raltegravir (400 mg) + darunavir (600\nmg) + ritonavir (100 mg); given as one tablet twice daily. In May 2020,\nthe national programme replaced raltegravir with dolutegravir for all\npatients.\n\n### Survival outcomes\n\nAt 12 month follow-up of third-line therapy, 72/85 (85%) patients were\nalive on ART, 6/85 (7%) patients died, and 7/85 (8%) were LFU. At the\nend of follow-up in March 2022, 61/85 (72%) patients were alive and on\nART, which included 1 patient who was LFU after 1 year of therapy and\nlater restarted therapy. Thirteen of the 85 patients (15%) died during\nthird-line therapy. (Figure 1 ) Eleven of the 85 patients (13%) were LFU\nat the end of follow-up of the study (Figure 1 ). Out of the seven\npatients who died beyond 1 year, only two had virological failure (Table\n2 ).\n\n### Virological outcomes\n\nOut of 72 patients who were alive at 12 month follow-up, 59/72 (82%)\npatients had suppressed VL (\\<150 copies/ml), while 13/72 (18%) did not\nattain virological suppression. At the end of follow-up of the study in\nMarch 2022, VL could be done in 67 patients, out of which 59 (88%) had\nvirological suppression. Five out of 13 patients (39%) who failed\ntherapy at 12 months were virologically suppressed at the end of\nfollow-up. One patient who restarted therapy after 1 year did not attain\nvirological suppression at the end of follow-up of the study (Figure 2\n).\n\nFigure 2.\n\nVirological outcomes of patients started on third-line therapy.\n\nOpen in new tab Download slide\n\n### HIV DRMs\n\nOut of 85 patients started on third-line therapy, 40 samples were\nsuccessfully sequenced for the IN gene and 38 for the PR and RT genes at\nbaseline (start of third-line therapy). All specimens were subtype C,\nexcept two, which were subtype B. At baseline, 35% (14/40) of these\npatients had major mutations associated with the IN gene: \\[E92D ( *n*\n= 5); T66P ( *n* = 2); Y143C/S/ *N* ( *n* = 7); N155H/T ( *n* = 4);\nQ148K/L ( *n* = 2); G140A ( *n* = 1); and G118R ( *n* = 1)\\], while 7\nhad accessory IN mutations. Out of these 14 patients, 5 died, 8 patients\nwere still on ART and virologically suppressed and 1 patient was LFU in\n2022. Seventeen out of 38 (45%) patients had major PI mutations (with a\nhigher frequency of N88S, M46I and L90M) at baseline, out of which 5\npatients died, 1 patient was LFU and 11 patients were virologically\nsuppressed and on ART at the end of follow-up. NRTI- and\nNNRTI-associated mutations were found in 25/38 (66%) and 28/38 (74%)\npatients, respectively.\n\nAmong the 13 patients who did not attain virological suppression at 12\nmonths, genotyping could be done in only 12. At the initiation of\nthird-line therapy among these 12 samples, 10 samples were successfully\nsequenced for the IN gene and 11 were sequenced for PR and RT genes.\nDetails of DRMs at baseline and during virological failure are shown in\nTable 3 . After 1 year of follow-up, out of these 12 samples of\nvirological failure patients, 11 were successfully sequenced for the IN\ngene and 10 were sequenced for PR and RT genes. Four patients (4/11;\n36%) had major IN mutations and 3/11 (27%) patients had IN accessory\nmutations. We did not detect any major PI mutations, while PI accessory\nmutations were found in 1/10 (10%) patient only (Table 3 ).\n\nDetails of the DRMs of the 13 patients who died during treatment are\ngiven in Table 2 . At baseline, out of these 13 samples, 11 were\nsequenced for the IN gene and 10 samples were sequenced for PR and RT\ngenes. Five (5/11; 46%) patients had major IN mutations and 2/11 (18%)\npatients had IN accessory mutations. Five (5/10; 50%) patients had major\nPI mutations and 5/10 (50%) patients had PI accessory mutations. Six\npatients had NRTI mutations and seven patients had NNRTI mutations.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis is the first study from India that has observed the long-term\noutcome of third-line ART (median follow-up was 42 months) of patients\nin programmatic settings and mutational analysis in those failing\ntreatment at 1 year. The survival of our patients at 1 year was 85%.\nThis was similar to third-line treatment studies done under programmatic\nconditions from India (81%), ^\\ \\ 9^ Zimbabwe (79%) ^\\ \\ 13^ and South\nAfrica (83%), ^\\ \\ 6^ while it was slightly lower than that of a private\nclinic in western India. ^\\ \\ 14^ At the end of follow-up in March 2022,\n15% of our patients had died. Although there is no study on long-term\noutcome of third-line ART in real-time settings, this was very high\ncompared with 4% death, observed in the ACTG A5288 clinical trial done\nin low- and middle-income countries. ^\\ \\ 15^ However, it was\nencouraging to observe that in our own centre, survival at the end of\nfollow-up in highly treatment-experienced patients on third-line ART\n(72%) was better that those on second-line therapy (65%). ^\\ \\ 16^ In\nour third-line cohort, 46% (6/13) of the deaths occurred within 12\nmonths; beyond that, among the 7 patients who died only 2 had\nvirological failure, suggesting the treatment was still working for most\nPLHIV. Risk factors for death were poor WHO clinical stage and low\nweight at the time of starting third-line therapy, which suggests\ndelayed diagnosis of second-line treatment failure. Baseline mutational\nanalysis among those who died showed that 50% (5/10) had major PI\nmutations, while 45% (5/11) had major IN mutations, suggesting that the\npatients may have been on a failing regimen for a long time before\nthird-line therapy was initiated. Thus, the best way to improve survival\nis by detecting patients with second-line failure and initiating\nthird-line therapy early. This can be done by ensuring ART centres do\nregular VL monitoring as per guidelines and early referral to higher\ncentres for initiation of third-line therapy. As all the third-line\npatients have to be referred to CoEs or ART Plus centres for evaluation.\nEfforts should also be made to make the referral process of these\npatients more efficient. This can be done easily by using virtual\nplatforms for referring patients.\n\nRetention in care is another critical component of HIV care\ninterventions and the 12% LFU in the cohort needs to be addressed for\nthe success of the programme. Out of the eleven patients who were LFU, 7\nwere from the neighbouring state of Bihar and rest were from other\ndistricts of Uttar Pradesh. One of the main reasons for high LFU may be\nthe fact that patients from distant areas come for third-line ART to our\ncentre, as third-line drugs are only available through the CoEs and ART\nPlus centres in the programme. These centres may be far from a patient's\nresidence, therefore improving accessibility of these drugs would\ndefinitely improve retention in care.\n\nAt 1 year follow-up, 82% of patients (59/72) in our study attained\nvirological suppression, similar to studies from both India\n^\\ \\ 4\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 9^ and other low- and middle-income countries.\n^\\ \\ 6\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 13^ VL suppression was maintained at the end of follow-up\nof the study in 88% of patients (59/67). This finding is similar to the\nACTG A5288 trial, where 83% and 80% of the participants had VL\nsuppression at Weeks 144 and 168, where the patients were not given a\nstandardized third-line regimen like our setup but antiretrovirals were\nbased on their genotyping results. This suggests that standardized\nrobust regimens for highly treatment-experienced PLHIV in public health\nprogrammes are as effective as regimens guided by genotyping results.\n\nSurprisingly, 5 out of 13 patients who had virological failure at 12\nmonths showed VL suppression at the end of the study. One reason could\nbe an adherence issue as four of these five patients showed no major PI\nor IN mutations at the time of failure. Another reason for virological\nsuppression could be the fact that there was a change in integrase\ninhibitor in the programme from raltegravir to dolutegravir in 2020 and\ndolutegravir is known to be effective, even in patients with raltegravir\nfailure.\n\nAt the start of the third-line regimen, 35% (14/40) had major INSTI\nDRMs, even when they had never been on an INSTI-based regimen, similar\nto the study by Gill *et al* . ^\\ \\ 14^ As the national programme has\nadopted dolutegravir-based regimens as first-line treatment in 2020, the\npresence of INSTI DRMs in INSTI-naive PLHIV is concerning and should be\nexplored further. Among those who had virological failure at 1 year, 33%\n(4/12) patients had major IN mutations but we did not detect any major\nPI mutations. None of the patients had resistance against darunavir and\nonly two had resistance against dolutegravir. There are no real-world\ndata of DRMs acquired in patients with third-line failure in the\nprogramme. However, in contrast to our findings, in a study conducted at\na tertiary care private HIV clinic in Pune, India, 90% of PLHIV failing\nraltegravir-based ART had at least one IN resistance associated\nmutation. ^\\ \\ 17^ The INSTI DRMs identified in our study both at\nbaseline and at treatment failure were similar to this study. The low\nprevalence of DRMs, even after failing third-line therapy, bodes well\nfor the programme. It reiterates the fact that the standardized\nthird-line antiretrovirals provided free in the programme are highly\neffective.\n\nThe limitation of our study is that data are from a single centre;\nhowever, as standardized ART is given throughout the programme, overall\noutcome should not be different from this study.\n\nTo conclude, this study shows good long-term treatment outcome for\npatients on standardized third-line therapy in programmatic conditions.\nTo further improve outcomes, priority needs to be given to early\ndetection of treatment failure and retention in care in the programme.\nTimely VL monitoring, along with decentralization and easy accessibility\nof third-line drugs in the peripheral ART centres, will definitely\ndecrease death and LFU patients on third-line ART in the programme.\n\n\n## Funding\n\nThis work was supported by the Centre of Excellence (CoE; Scheme 4080)\nin HIV Care, National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), government of\nIndia.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 29026792\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: Patients were referred who were on ART treatment above 12 months and immunologically suspicious of treatment failure.

We\nevaluated the impact of different baseline variables in the RESPOND\ncohort.\n\n### Methods\n\nWe included treatment-naive participants aged ≥18 who initiated 3-drug\nART, in 2014--2020. We assessed the odds of virological suppression (VS)\nat weeks 48 and 96 using logistic regression. Viral blips, low-level\nviremia (LLV), residual viremia (RV), and virological failure (VF) rates\nwere assessed using Cox regression.\n\n### Results\n\nOf 4310 eligible participants, 72% started integrase strand transfer\ninhibitor (INSTI)-based regimens. At 48 and 96 weeks, 91.0% and 93.3%\nachieved VS, respectively. At 48 weeks, Kaplan-Meier estimates of rates\nwere 9.6% for viral blips, 2.1% for LLV, 22.2% for RV, and 2.1% for VF.\nBaseline HIV-1 RNA levels \\>100 000 copies/mL and CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts\n≤200/µL were negatively associated with VS at weeks 48 (adjusted odds\nratio, 0.51 \\[95% confidence interval, .39--.68\\] and .40 \\[.27--.58\\],\nrespectively) and 96 and with significantly higher rates of blips, LLV,\nand RV. CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts ≤200/µL were associated with higher risk\nof VF (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.12 \\[95% confidence interval,\n2.02--4.83\\]). Results were consistent in those starting INSTIs versus\nother regimens and those starting dolutegravir versus other INSTIs.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nInitial high HIV-1 RNA and low CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts are associated with\nlower rates of VS at 48 and 96 weeks and higher rates of viral blips,\nLLV, and RV. Low baseline CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts are associated with\nhigher VF rates. These associations remain with INSTI-based and\nspecifically with dolutegravir-based regimens. These findings suggest\nthat the impact of these baseline determinants is independent of the ART\nregimen initiated.\n\n\n\n## METHODS\n\n### Study Design and Data Sources\n\nThe International Cohort Consortium of Infectious Diseases (RESPOND) is\na collaboration among 19 cohorts from Europe and Australia, using the\nHIV Cohorts Data Exchange Protocol for data collection (details at\nhttps://hicdep.org/ ) \\[ 25 \\]. Clinical and demographic data were\ncollected retrospectively back to 2012 at RESPOND enrollment and\nprospectively since 2017.\n\n### Study Population\n\nParticipants consented to share data according to local requirements.\nAll cohorts had approval to share data with RESPOND according to\nnational requirements. We included all ART-naive adults aged ≥18 years\nwho started ART between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2020, from 17 of\n19 cohorts. Participants had a CD4 ^+^ T-cell count measured and a\ndetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA value at ART initiation and a minimum\nfollow-up time of 36 weeks.\n\n### Virological Outcome Definitions\n\nVS was defined as HIV-1 RNA levels \\<50 copies/mL at weeks 48 and 96,\nwith a 12-week window on either side; LLV, as the first of ≥ 2\nconsecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA measurements of 50--199 copies/mL,\nfollowing VS; viral blip, as an isolated plasma HIV-1 RNA level of\n50--199 copies/mL with previous and subsequent HIV-1 RNA levels \\<50\ncopies/mL, following VS; RV, as any detectable and quantifiable plasma\nHIV-1 RNA between 20 and 49 copies/mL, among participants with a HIV-1\nRNA measurement with a limit of detection of 20 copies/mL, following VS;\nand VF, as the first of 2 consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA measurements ≥50\ncopies/mL, with 1 measurement ≥200 copies/mL, following VS.\n\n### Statistical Methods\n\nA descriptive analysis of participants' demographic and\nimmunovirological characteristics at ART initiation was carried out\nusing frequency tables for categorical variables and median and\ninterquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables. The outcomes were\nassessed in an intention-to-treat-exposed analysis including all\nparticipants starting their first ART regimen regardless of subsequent\ndiscontinuations and/or switches.\n\nWe used a logistic regression model to assess the impact of multiple\nbaseline predictor variables on VS at weeks 48 and 96, expressed as\nadjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Kaplan-Meier\ncurves were used to estimate the time to viral blips, LLV, RV and VF,\nstratified by the third drug, and the comparison among curves was\nperformed using log-rank tests. We performed a survival analysis using\nCox regression to assess the impact of baseline variables on virological\nnonsuppression outcomes (ie, viral blips, LLV, RV, and VF). Associations\nwere expressed as adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CIs.\n\nBaseline variables were defined a priori. Models were adjusted for sex,\nage, year of ART initiation, race, hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus\nantibodies), European Australian region, prior AIDS-defining illness,\nHIV-1 RNA, CD4 ^+^ T-cell count and initial ART classes. The latter\nincluded: a 2--nucleos(t)ide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)\nbackbone (abacavir-lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate\n\\[TDF\\]--emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide \\[TAF\\]--emtricitabine)\nplus 1 of the following third agents: cobicistat- or ritonavir-boosted\ndarunavir (protease inhibitor \\[PI\\]), rilpivirine (nonnucleoside\nreverse-transcriptase inhibitor \\[NNRTI\\]), and cobicistat-boosted\nelvitegravir, dolutegravir, or raltegravir (INSTI).\n\nSensitivity analyses were performed for viral blips, LLV, RV, and VF,\nrestricted first only to participants who started treatment with INSTIs\nand further restricted to those who started dolutegravir versus other\nINSTIs. A category was included for missing data for confounders where\nrequired. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software\n(Statistical Analysis Software), version 9.4. All tests were 2 tailed,\nand the significance level α was set at .05.\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Baseline Characteristics\n\nWe included 4310 eligible ART-naive participants ( Figure 1 ). Of these,\n84% were male, 69.2% were white, 61.2% were men who had sex with men,\n42.6% were from Central Europe, 89.8% were without prior AIDS, and 43.3%\nstarted ART in year 2014--2015. Their median age (IQR) was 38 ( 30--47)\nyears, and 812 (18.8%) were \\>50 years old ( Table 1 ). The median\nfollow-up time (IQR) since starting ART was 3.8 (2.4--5.1) years, with\n16 106 person-years of follow-up, with a median (IQR) of 8 (5--12) CD4\n^+^ T-cell counts and 10 (6--14) HIV-1 RNA measurements.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nInternational Cohort Consortium of Infectious Diseases (RESPOND) flow\nchart. Abbreviations: ART, antiretroviral treatment; HIV-1, human\nimmunodeficiency virus type 1; LLV, low-level viremia; NRTI,\nnucleos(t)ide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor; RV, residual viremia; VF,\nvirological failure; VS, virological suppression.\n\n\nBaseline CD4 ^+^ T-cell count and HIV-1 RNA level were defined as the\nlast measurement in the 12 months preceding the ART initiation date,\nand, where this was not available, the first measurement up to 14 days\nafter ART initiation.\n\nThe median (IQR) CD4 ^+^ T-cell count was 378/µL (199--560/µL). Overall,\n1971 participants (45.7%) had CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts ≤350/µL at\npresentation, and 1092 (25.3%) had severe immunosuppression (CD4 ^+^\nT-cell count, ≤200/µL); 36.1% had HIV-1 RNA levels ≥100 000 copies/mL.\nOverall, 72.3% of participants initiated an INSTI-based regimen, of whom\n1970 (63.3%) started dolutegravir ( Table 1 ).\n\n### Virological Outcomes\n\nVS at weeks 48 and 96 was achieved in 3306 of 3638 (90.9% \\[95% CI,\n89.9%--91.8%) and 2908 of 3118 (93.3% \\[92.4%--94.1%\\]) participants,\nrespectively. At 48 weeks, Kaplan-Meier estimates of the proportions\nwere 9.6% (95%, CI, 8.7%--10.5%) for viral blips, 2.1% (1.6%--2.5%) for\nLLV, 22.2% (20.0%--24.3%) for RV, and 2.1% (1.7%--2.6%) for VF.\n\n### Virological Suppression\n\nIn multivariate analysis, darunavir (vs dolutegravir), baseline HIV-1\nRNA levels \\>100 000 copies/mL and CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts ≤350/µL at ART\ninitiation were associated with significantly lower VS rates at week 48\n( Table 2 ). At week 96, abacavir-lamivudine (vs TDF-emtricitabine),\nraltegravir (vs dolutegravir), HIV-1-RNA levels \\>100 000 copies/mL, and\nCD4 ^+^ T-cell counts ≤350/µL were associated with significantly lower\nVS rates ( Table 2 ).\n\nBaseline CD4 ^+^ T-cell count and HIV-1 RNA level were defined as the\nlast measurement in the 12 months preceding ART initiation date and,\nwhere this was not available, the first measurement up to 14 days after\nART initiation.\n\n### Viral Blips Analysis\n\nIn the time-to-blip analysis ( Figure 2  * ​ A A * ), differences among\nthird drugs favored rilpivirine ( *P* \\< .001) with a time to blip\nlonger than raltegravir ( *P* \\< .001). Darunavir and dolutegravir had\nsimilar times to blip ( *P* = .16).\n\nFigure 2.\n\nTime-to-virological outcomes estimated by Kaplan-Meier curves.

Factors associated with a higher rate of blips were age 41--50\nyears, Central European region, prior AIDS, and CD4 ^+^ T-cell count\n≤350/µL. Baseline HIV-1 RNA levels paralleled blip incidence, with\nvalues ≤10 000 copies/mL associated with lower rates, whereas those\n\\>100 000 copies/mL had the highest blip risk. We found no association\nbetween NRTIs or the third drug and blip incidence ( Figure 3  * ​ A A *\n).\n\nFigure 3.\n\nMultivariate analysis of viral blip ( *A* ) and low-level viremia ( *B*\n) rates.

The same analysis restricted to dolutegravir-based regimens\nshowed an association between HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts\nand blips ( Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 ).\n\n### LLV Analysis\n\nIn the time-to-LLV analysis ( Figure 2  * ​ B B * ), differences among\nall third drugs favored rilpivirine ( *P* = .004) overall, with a longer\ntime than raltegravir ( *P* = .001) or dolutegravir ( *P* \\< .001) and\nsimilar results as for darunavir and dolutegravir ( *P* = .90).\n\nFemale sex and Eastern European region were associated with lower LLV\nrates in multivariate analysis. Baseline HIV-1 RNA levels ≤10 000\ncopies/mL were associated with lower LLV rates and levels \\>100 000\ncopies/mL with the highest rates. CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts ≤500/µL were\nassociated with a higher LLV risk. We found no association between NRTIs\nor the third drugs and LLV ( Figure 3  * ​ B B * ).\n\nThese associations remained in the subset receiving INSTI-based regimens\n(female sex, Eastern European region, HIV-1 RNA level \\>100 000\ncopies/mL, CD4 ^+^ T-cell count ≤350/µL). In the dolutegravir subset,\nHIV-1 RNA levels \\>100 000 copies/mL and CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts ≤500/µL\nremained associated with LLV ( Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 ).\n\n### RV Analysis\n\nThe time-to-RV analysis across third drugs favored rilpivirine ( *P* \\<\n.001) ( Figure 2  * ​ C C * ). Darunavir showed a similar time to RV as\nrilpivirine ( *P* = .28) and a longer time than dolutegravir ( *P* =\n.01). Eastern European region was associated with lower RV rates in\nmultivariate analysis. TAF-emtricitabine (vs TDF-emtricitabine) was\nassociated with a higher RV incidence. Baseline HIV-1 RNA levels ≤10 000\ncopies/mL were associated with a lower RV rate, whereas those \\>100 000\ncopies/mL and CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts ≤200/µL were associated with the\nhighest RV rates ( Figure 4  * ​ A A * ). Within the subset treated with\nINSTI and specifically dolutegravir, Eastern European region and HIV-1\nRNA levels, but not CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts, remained associated with RV (\nSupplementary Tables 1 and 2 ).\n\nFigure 4.\n\nMultivariate analysis of residual viremia ( *A* ) and virological\nfailure ( *B* ) rates.

Raltegravir had a\nshorter time to VF than rilpivirine ( *P* \\< .001), dolutegravir ( *P* =\n.002), and darunavir (borderline significance, *P* = .056).\n\nIn multivariate analysis, factors associated with higher VF rates (\nFigure 4  * ​ B B * ) were female sex, nonwhite race, chronic hepatitis C\nvirus, prior AIDS, and Central European region, whereas age 31--50 years\nwas associated with lower VF rates. Low baseline CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts\n(≤200/µL or 351--500/µL) were associated with higher VF rates ( Figure 4\n* ​ B B * ), but, intriguingly, HIV-1 RNA levels were not. Raltegravir\nuse was associated with higher VF rates in multivariate analysis\ncompared to dolutegravir, whereas rilpivirine was not. TAF-emtricitabine\n(vs TDF-emtricitabine) was associated with lower rates of VF.\n\nThe subset of any INSTI- and dolutegravir-based regimen showed an\nincreased risk of VF associated with lower CD4 ^+^ T-cell count. No\nassociation was found with HIV-1 RNA levels or TAF-emtricitabine (\nSupplementary Tables 1 and 2 ).\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nPWH who initiated ART beyond 2014 in the multinational prospective\nRESPOND cohort, with 72% of participants receiving INSTI-based regimens,\nhad high VS rates at weeks 48 and 96 (91.0% and 93.3%, respectively).\nUsing stringent definitions for virological nonsuppression outcomes, at\n48 weeks the proportions with viral blips, LLV, RV, and VF were 9.6%,\n2.1%, 22.2%, and 2.1%, respectively.\n\nHigh baseline HIV-1-RNA and low CD4+ counts were strongly associated\nwith lower rates of VS at 48 and 96 weeks. The use of darunavir (vs\ndolutegravir) was associated with a significantly lower probability of\nVS at week 48, but this association was lost at week 96. PIs have slower\ninitial viral load decay kinetics compared with INSTIs, particularly\nwith high baseline HIV-1 RNA levels, as shown in randomized clinical\ntrials \\[ 26 , 27 \\] and cohort studies \\[ 28 \\]. In our study,\nabacavir-lamivudine, higher HIV-1 RNA and lower CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts\nwere associated with lower rates of VS at 96 weeks. Abacavir-lamivudine\nwas associated with a significantly shorter time to VF than\nTDF-emtricitabine combined with either boosted atazanavir or efavirenz\nin the AIDS Clinical Trials Group A5202, in strata of HIV-1 RNA levels\n≥100 000 copies/mL and CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts \\<200/µL \\[ 29 \\]. However,\nthis has not been reproduced in pivotal dolutegravir studies in initial\ntreatment \\[ 26 , 30 \\].\n\nWe found a significant association between high baseline plasma HIV-1\nRNA level or low CD4 ^+^ T-cell count and the blip incidence in the\noverall cohort and in participants starting an INSTI- and\ndolutegravir-based regimen. This is consistent with findings in previous\ncohorts \\[ 23 , 24 \\]. In turn, blip rates were higher with PI-based and\nlower with INSTI-based ART. However, there could have been a channeling\nprescription bias of PIs to higher-risk PWH based on their perceived\nhigher barrier to resistance \\[ 24 \\]. We found no association between\nviral blips and NRTI or third drug types in our analysis. These data are\nconsistent with results from a randomized trial comparing dolutegravir\nwith ritonavir-boosted darunavir \\[ 26 \\].\n\nA significant association between high baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA level\nand low CD4 ^+^ T-cell count was also seen with LLV overall, with any\nINSTI- and dolutegravir-based regimens. These findings are in agreement\nwith those in a Spanish cohort \\[ 31 \\] showing that a plasma HIV-1 RNA\nlevel \\>100 000 copies/mL was an independent predictor of LLV, an\nassociation that remained for participants starting any INSTI-based\nregimen. Conversely, other cohorts have reported a higher risk of LLV\nwith PI-based than with NNRTI- and INSTI-based regimens \\[ 6 \\].\nHowever, these analyses had a low proportion of darunavir use among PIs\n(most participants received atazanavir or lopinavir) \\[ 6 \\]. It is\nlikely that the risk of LLV could be different for darunavir versus\nother PIs. In our study the only PI included was darunavir, the only\ncurrently recommended PI \\[ 1 , 14 \\].\n\nThe rate of RV in our study (22.2%) was similar to that described in a\nDutch cohort (24.7%) \\[ 12 \\]. High baseline HIV-1 RNA level and low CD4\n^+^ T-cell count were also associated with increased rates of RV. In our\nanalysis, the association with HIV-1 RNA level remained in participants\nreceiving any INSTI and dolutegravir in particular, consistent with\nfindings in a previous French cohort \\[ 32 \\].\n\nInterestingly, while low CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts were significantly\nassociated with VF, high baseline HIV-1 RNA levels were not. This\nfinding is consistent with findings in a French cohort \\[ 11 \\], with no\nrelationship between baseline HIV-1 RNA level and VF. In addition, HIV-1\nRNA \\>100 000 copies/mL did not affect risk of VF in a European cohort\n\\[ 28 \\]. These results differ from those observed in a Spanish cohort\n\\[ 31 \\] in which a HIV-1 RNA \\>100 000 copies/mL was a consistent\npredictor of VF. Different definitions of VF and time points for HIV-1\nRNA measurements could lead to noncomparable results. Similarly, other\ncohorts \\[ 33 , 34 \\] found a higher risk of VF with HIV-1 RNA levels\n≥100 000 copies/mL on INSTI-based regimens. However, because both\ncohorts used thresholds of 50 copies/mL for VF, many VFs could have been\nLLV. Another recent analysis has found an association between baseline\nHIV-1 RNA level and VF (hazard ratio, 1.1 \\[95% CI, 1.0--1.2\\]) \\[ 2 \\],\nbut for a broader definition of VF.\n\nIn our analysis, compared to TDF, TAF was associated with higher rates\nof RV but a lower risk of VF. TAF showed superior virological efficacy\ncompared with TDF in a clinical trial \\[ 35 \\]; however, there were no\ndata on its impact on RV.\n\nRaltegravir had a significantly shorter time to VF than rilpivirine,\ndarunavir, or dolutegravir. This association remained significant in\nmultivariate analysis. This is consistent with findings of the SPRING-2\ntrial, showing fewer participants who met protocol-defined VF with\ndolutegravir versus raltegravir \\[ 30 \\]. Indeed, raltegravir showed\nlower VS rates at week 96 in our multivariate analysis. Unmeasured\nresidual confounding could exist regarding raltegravir dosing\nnotwithstanding. Raltegravir once daily is associated with higher rates\nof VF, particularly with high HIV-1 RNA and low CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts,\nbut we did not have access to dosing data for raltegravir in RESPOND \\[\n36 , 37 \\]. In a recent European cohort analysis, INSTI- and NNRTI-based\nART had similar rates of VF, whereas PI-based ART was associated with an\nincreased risk of VF \\[ 2 \\]. However, not every drug within a class was\nassessed owing to the limited number of virological outcome events.\n\nResults were consistent regarding HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4 ^+^ T-cell\ncounts in those starting INSTIs versus other ART classes or those\nstarting dolutegravir (compared with other individual INSTIs), for every\nvirological nonsuppression outcome. These findings strongly suggest that\nHIV-1 RNA level and CD4 ^+^ T-cell count are baseline determinants\nassociated with long-term consequences, including higher rates of viral\nblips, LLV, and RV, independent of the ART regimen initiated.\nAlternatively, VF was associated only with a low baseline CD4 ^+^ T-cell\ncount. All of these findings indicate that the interaction between the\nHIV reservoir established before ART initiation and the rates of viral\nblips, LLV, and RV seems to be closely related to baseline HIV-1 RNA\nlevel but not to the type of ART administered, including the\nsecond-generation INSTIs \\[ 18 , 38--40 \\]. HIV-1 integrated into silent\nchromosomal sites in the deep latency of clonally expanded infected T\ncells can harbor defective proviruses and, less likely, intact\n(replication-competent) viruses, which are not affected by ART \\[ 41 ,\n42 \\]. Nonsuppressible RV has been associated with large HIV reservoir\nsize \\[ 43 , 44 \\]. In addition, the nadir CD4 ^+^ T-cell count was\ninversely correlated with levels of both cell-associated DNA and\ncell-associated RNA in a pooled analysis of AIDS Clinical Trials Group\ntreatment interruption studies \\[ 38 \\].\n\nIn the current study, the time to virological nonsuppression outcomes\n(viral blips, LLV, RV, and VF) was significantly and consistently longer\nfor rilpivirine. The fact that this association disappeared after\nadjustment reflects the imbalance in baseline characteristics between\nthe different treatments. The use of rilpivirine plus 2 NRTIs has been\napproved only for PWH with HIV-1 RNA levels \\<100 000 copies/mL and is\nnot recommended for those with CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts \\<200/µL,\nsupporting a likely channeling prescription bias, as it is\npreferentially prescribed in PWH with characteristics associated with\nbetter virological outcomes \\[ 14 , 45 \\]. The Italian Italian cohort\nnaive antiretrovirals cohort compared rilpivirine- and INSTI-based\nfirst-line regimens in participants with HIV-1 RNA levels \\<100 000\ncopies/mL and CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts \\>200/µL and found no differences in\nvirological rebound rates \\[ 46 \\].\n\nWe identified higher rates of VF in nonwhite PHW. This association\nprobably reflects higher rates of immigration, socioeconomic\ndeprivation, and lower treatment adherence rates in this group \\[ 47 \\].\n\nOur study has limitations. RESPOND does not systematically collect data\non HIV subtypes and genotypic resistance analysis, which could affect\nthe choice of initial ART or the virological outcome. The\nsecond-generation INSTI bictegravir, the 2-drug regimen\ndolutegravir-lamivudine and the new NNRTI doravirine were not included\nowing to an insufficient number of participants or short follow-up.\nDespite adjustment for a wide range of variables, confounding by\nindication and residual uncontrolled confounders might still introduce\nunknown biases in drug comparisons.\n\nA strength of the current study is the inclusion of a large number of\nINSTI-based participants and the ability to compare individual drugs\nwithin ART classes. In addition, we describe virological nonsuppression\noutcomes not explored in randomized trials, using strict definitions.\n\nIn conclusion, baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA levels \\>100 000copies/mL and\nCD4 ^+^ T-cell counts ≤350/µL were associated with lower rates of VS at\n48 and 96 weeks, and higher rates of viral blips, RV, and LLV. CD4 ^+^\nT-cell counts ≤200/µL were associated with a higher risk of VF.\nImportantly, the association between HIV-1 RNA levels or CD4 ^+^ T-cell\ncount and these virological outcomes persisted in participants\ninitiating INSTI-based and specifically dolutegravir-based regimens.\nThese data suggest that baseline HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4 ^+^ T-cell\ncounts are determinants associated with virological nonsuppression\noutcomes regardless of the antiretroviral regimen initiated and point to\nunderlying mechanisms established before ART initiation, likely focused\non the HIV reservoir size. Further research is warranted to explore the\nimpact of bictegravir-emtricitabine-TAF, doravirine, and INSTI-based\n2-drug regimens on long-term virological nonsuppression outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Financial support* .** The International Cohort Consortium of\nInfectious Disease (RESPOND) is supported by ViiV Healthcare, Gilead\nSciences, and Merck Sharp & Dohme.

Despite\nthis, resistance to DTG and BIC can occur through the development of the\nR263K integrase substitution. Failure with DTG has also been associated\nwith the emergence of the G118R substitution. G118R and R263K are\nusually found separately but have been reported together in highly\ntreatment-experienced persons who experienced treatment failure with\nDTG. We used cell-free strand transfer and DNA binding assays and\ncell-based infectivity, replicative capacity, and resistance assays to\ncharacterize the G118R plus R263K combination of integrase mutations.\nR263K reduced DTG and BIC susceptibility \\~2-fold, in agreement with our\nprevious work. Single-cycle infectivity assays showed that G118R and\nG118R plus R263K conferred \\~10-fold resistance to DTG. G118R alone\nconferred low levels of resistance to BIC (3.9-fold). However, the G118R\nplus R263K combination conferred high levels of resistance to BIC\n(33.7-fold), likely precluding the use of BIC after DTG failure with the\nG118R plus R263K combination. DNA binding, viral infectivity, and\nreplicative capacity of the double mutant were further impaired,\ncompared to single mutants. We propose that impaired fitness helps to\nexplain the scarcity of the G118R plus R263K combination of integrase\nsubstitutions in clinical settings and that immunodeficiency likely\ncontributes to its development.\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Effects of G118R and R263K substitutions on integrase strand transfer activity.\n\nTo characterize the integrase proteins carrying the G118R, R263K, and\nG118R plus R263K substitutions, we performed two types of assays, which\nare schematized in Fig. 1 . We used preprocessed LTR DNA for the strand\ntransfer assay and blunt LTR DNA for the LTR DNA binding assay. Strand\ntransfer assays with 300 nM preprocessed LTR DNA, 60 nM target DNA, and\nvarious concentrations of integrase proteins (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400,\n800, and 1,600 nM) showed that wild-type (WT), G118R, R263K, and G118R\nplus R263K proteins displayed maximal integration activities between 100\nand 400 nM ( Fig. 2A ). Additional strand transfer assays with 300 nM\npreprocessed LTR DNA, 400 nM integrase proteins, and various\nconcentrations of target DNA substrate (0, 1.88, 3.75, 7.5, 15, 30, 60,\nand 120 nM) showed that R263K and G118R individually decreased target\nDNA binding affinity (pseudo- *K ~m~* ) and maximal strand transfer\nactivity (pseudo- *V* ~max~ ) ( Fig. 2B and Table 1 ), in agreement with\nprevious reports ( 14 , 20 ). Combining G118R with R263K further\ndecreased target DNA binding, compared to G118R ( Table 1 ).\nSpecifically, the increase in pseudo- *K ~m~* values was 2.5-fold for\nthe G118R protein and 4.4-fold for the G118R plus R263K protein,\ncompared to the WT protein. Maximal integration (pseudo- *V* ~max~ )\ndecreased by 60% for the R263K protein and by 85% for the G118R protein.\nHowever, maximal integration was significantly higher for the G118R plus\nR263K protein than for the G118R protein. Overall, enzymatic\nefficiencies were similar for G118R and G118R plus R263K integrase\nproteins.\n\nFIG 1\n\nSchematic representation of the strand transfer and DNA binding assays.\n(A) The strand transfer assay was performed with a preprocessed LTR DNA\n(red) that lacked a GT dinucleotide and carried a reactive hydroxyl\ngroup (-OH) at the 3′ terminus. The complete method is described in\nMaterials and Methods. Briefly, immobilized preprocessed LTR DNA (red)\nwas incubated with integrase (multicolor) and different concentrations\nof biotin-labeled target DNA (black) for 1 h at 37°C. After washes, the\namount of integrated target DNA was measured via biotin (green)\nquantification with europium-labeled streptavidin (dark blue).\nTime-resolved fluorescence was plotted against the target DNA\nconcentrations to produce pseudo- *V* ~max~ (maximum integration) and\npseudo- *K ~m~* , which accounted for target DNA binding affinity. (B)\nDNA binding assays were performed with a blunt LTR DNA (red) labeled\nwith rhodamine (green). The complete method is described in Materials\nand Methods. Immobilized integrase proteins (multicolor) were incubated\nwith various concentrations of LTR DNA for 1 h at 37°C. After washes,\nthe amount of bound DNA was measured by quantifying fluorescence.\nResults were plotted against LTR DNA concentrations to produce *K ~d~*\nvalues.\n\nFIG 2\n\nStrand transfer activities of WT, R263K, G118R, and G118R plus R263K\nrecombinant HIV-1 integrase proteins. (A) Relative strand transfer\nactivity in the presence of various protein concentrations. Results from\ntwo separate experiments performed with two different protein batches\n(four experiments) were compiled after normalization against the mean\nfluorescence value (from triplicates) obtained with the WT protein at\n400 nM, arbitrarily set at 100%. Means ± standard deviations are\npresented. (B) Relative strand transfer activity in the presence of\nincreasing target DNA concentrations (0, 1.8, 3.75, 7, 15, 30, 60, and\n120 nM). Results from three separate experiments performed with two\ndifferent protein batches (six experiments) were compiled after\nnormalization against the mean fluorescence value (from triplicates)\nobtained with the WT protein and 120 nM target DNA, arbitrarily set at\n100%. Means ± standard deviations are presented.\n\n### Combining G118R and R263K reduces LTR DNA binding more than single substitutions.\n\nWe previously demonstrated that R263K and G118R individually decreased\nintegrase-viral DNA binding ( 14 , 20 ). To further explore the effects\nof these two substitutions combined, we measured the direct interaction\nbetween WT, R263K, G118R, and G118R plus R263K integrase proteins and\nthe viral DNA, using a binding assay that we developed previously with\nan LTR-mimetic DNA as ligand ( 21 ). In agreement with previous work,\nour results showed that R263K and G118R individually decreased\nintegrase-viral DNA binding affinity 2- and 1.8-fold, respectively (\nTable 1 ). Combining R263K with G118R reduced integrase-viral DNA\nbinding 5-fold.\n\n### Combining G118R and R263K decreases HIV-1 infectivity and replicative capacity and increases resistance to DTG and BIC.\n\nBased on our cell-free assays, we suspected that combining G118R with\nR263K might further impair the infectivity of HIV-1, compared to single\nmutants. To test this hypothesis, we performed single-cycle infectivity\nand multicycle replication assays. Short-term infectivity assays in\nTZM-bl reporter cells showed that G118R and R263K reduced infectivity by\n64% and 33%, respectively ( Fig. 3 and Table 1 ). The G118R plus R263K\ncombination of substitutions was associated with a 70% reduction in\ninfectivity. We measured the replicative capacity of the WT, G118R,\nR263K, and G118R plus R263K HIV-1 viruses in multicycle infections of\nPM1 cells, as published previously ( 22 , 23 ). We monitored HIV-1\nreplication by measuring the release of active reverse transcriptase\n(RT) enzymes in the cell culture fluids over 20 days. The results were\nplotted against time, and areas under the curves were calculated to\nestimate the overall relative replicative capacity of the viruses (\nTable 1 ). This analysis showed that R263K reduced HIV-1 replicative\ncapacity minimally (91%, compared to the WT virus). G118R significantly\ndecreased the replicative capacity (34%; *P* \\< 0.05). G118R plus R263K\nfurther impaired viral replication (\\<10% of the value for the WT\nvirus), compared to G118R. RT values peaked at day 11 for WT and R263K\nviruses and at day 20 for G118R and G118R plus R263K viruses ( Fig. 4 ).\nSince G118R plus R263K virus has been reported in patients failing\nDTG-based antiretroviral therapy, we performed resistance assays with\nDTG. However, we also included BIC since this drug may be considered\nafter failure with DTG, given that resistance levels can be lower for\nBIC than for DTG ( 24 , 25 ) ( Table 1 ). We confirmed that R263K\nconfers low-level resistance against DTG (1.9-fold) and BIC (2.4-fold),\nin agreement with previous reports ( 25 , 26 ). G118R conferred higher\nresistance levels against DTG (10.9-fold) and BIC (3.9-fold) ( 27 , 28\n). G118R plus R263K further increased resistance levels against DTG\n(13.9-fold) and BIC (33.7-fold), compared to G118R, but only the latter\nincrease was statistically significant ( Table 1 ).\n\nFIG 3\n\nRelative infectivity of WT, R263K, G118R, and G118R plus R263K HIV-1.\nTZM-bl reporter cells were infected for 24 h with various HIV-1 forms at\ndifferent concentrations. Results from two separate experiments with two\ndifferent viral stocks were compiled after normalization against the\nmean maximal and minimal RLU values (from triplicates), arbitrarily set\nat 100% and 0%, respectively. Infectivity curves were plotted against\nthe log viral concentrations in RT units using GraphPad Prism v9.4.1.\nMeans ± standard deviations are presented.\n\nFIG 4\n\nMulticycle replication assay results. PM1 cells were infected with WT,\nR263K, G118R, and G118R plus R263K HIV-1, and replication was monitored\nby quantifying the RT activity in the cell culture fluids 2, 4, 6, 9,\n11, 13, 16, 18, and 20 days postinfection. Results from two separate\nexperiments with two different viral stocks were compiled after\nnormalization against the maximal RT values obtained with the WT virus\nafter 11 days of infection, arbitrarily set at 100%. A logarithmic scale\nwas used to allow visualization of the G118R plus R263K virus\nreplication curve. Areas under the curves were calculated using GraphPad\nPrism v9.4.1, and results are presented in Table 1 . Means ± standard\ndeviations are presented.\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nOur observation that combining G118R and R263K was detrimental to\nintegration and viral infectivity helps to explain why this combination\nhas been found only rarely in clinical settings. We already showed that\nG118R and R263K reduced HIV-1 subtype B integrase strand transfer\nactivity when considered individually ( 14 , 27 ) and that cell-free\nintegration and infectivity assays typically showed similar trends ( 29\n). When we carefully examined our data, we found that adding R263K to\nG118R (from G118R to G118R plus R263K) reduced HIV-1 replicative\ncapacity by 24% ( Table 1 ). Reciprocally, adding G118R to R263K (from\nR263K to G118R plus R263K) reduced the replicative capacity by 81%. The\nlarger negative impact of G118R on integration and fitness is explained\nby *in silico* structural modeling showing that G118R occludes the\nintegrase catalytic site. The G118R substitution also clashed\nconformationally with BIC when this inhibitor was bound to integrase (\nFig. 5 ). These observations are consistent with previous observations (\n14 , 18 , 20 ). Congruent with our cell-based and cell-free experiments,\nmolecular modeling did not reveal conformational changes that could\nsuggest that G118R and R263K compensate for each other. Reciprocally to\nintegration and fitness, the increase in resistance against DTG\nassociated with adding R263K to G118R (from G118R to G118R plus R263K)\n(+3-fold) was smaller than that caused by adding G118R to R263K (from\nR263K to G118R+R263K) (+12-fold). Given the latter significant benefit\nin terms of resistance, it seems difficult to explain why G118R does not\narise from R263K-positive viruses more often in clinical settings\nwithout considering the critical connection between viral fitness and\nimmunological pressure.\n\nFIG 5\n\nEffect of G118R on BIC binding to the HIV-1 integrase catalytic site.\nThe WT protein is shown in red and the *in silico* -modeled G118R mutant\nin green. BIC is colored by standard elements (nitrogen in blue, carbon\nin gray, oxygen in red, and fluorine in green). The overlap between\nG118R and BIC suggests a conformational clash between the substituted\namino acid and the small molecule.\n\nThe rarity of cases with G118R plus R263K is not merely a consequence of\nthe individual scarcity of G118R and R263K. For example, although they\nwere individually reported for 6 participants, R263K and G118R were not\nfound in combination in the IMPAACT P1093 clinical trial ( 30 ).\nSimilarly, none of the 9 participants in the NADIA clinical trials who\ndeveloped DTG resistance mutations, including 5 with G118R and 4 with\nR263K, had a G118R plus R263K combination ( 31 ). G118R plus R263K was\npreviously reported without evidence of the two substitutions coexisting\nin single genomes ( 17 ). Instead, G118R and R263K representation in the\nretroviral population was compatible with their segregation on distinct\ngenomes. G118R occurrence rates varied from 0% to 45% after emergence,\nwhile R263K rates antagonistically varied from 99% to 30%. The total\nrepresentation of the two mutations was consistently \\<100% ( 17 ).\n\nIn contrast, three participants in the DAWNING clinical trial\nexperienced virological failure with G118R plus R263K, and clonal\nanalysis found the two mutations together in single HIV-1 genomes in two\ncases ( 18 ). In those cases, high viral loads (1,248,517 and 852,142\nHIV RNA copies/mL of plasma in the DAWNING trial) and non-B subtypes\n(subtypes C and A1) might have favored the emergence of this combination\nof mutations ( 18 ).\n\nWhen the combination of G118R plus R263K occurs, the current report and\nprevious publications suggest that none of the other integrase\ninhibitors may be used. Indeed, we show that this combination of\nsubstitutions confers high levels of resistance against BIC. In\naddition, neither raltegravir nor elvitegravir should be considered,\nsince G118R alone confers resistance to both drugs ( 27 , 32 ). This\nsituation is different from that when R263K is found alone, since that\nsubstitution is predicted to retain susceptibility to raltegravir ( 33\n). We cannot speculate on the effectiveness of twice-daily 50 mg DTG, or\nhigher doses, after G118R plus R263K has emerged. Further\ncharacterization of HIV resistance pathways evolving from G118R and\nR263K is required to improve the treatment management of the few\nindividuals who will progress through these pathways.\n\nBased on the DAWNING observations and given that viral fitness is\ncritical to the control of HIV-1 ( 34 ), we hypothesize that low CD4 ^+^\ncell counts and high viral loads provide a weak immunological\nenvironment favorable to the development of highly drug-resistant,\npoorly replicative combinations of mutations such as G118R plus R263K.\nReciprocally, however, we also think that developing such combinations\nof substitutions may not preclude future virological suppression with\nDTG- or BIC-based antiretroviral regimens once immune competency has\nbeen restored. Clinical data are needed to test this hypothesis, which\nis supported by our previous publication, in which progression to high\nlevels of resistance to DTG through the S153F plus R263K combination\n(fold change \\[FC\\] in resistance to DTG of \\>100) did not lead to\ntreatment failure ( 23 ).\n\n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Cells and antiviral compounds.\n\nTZM-bl and PM1 cells were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and\nReference Reagent Program, and 293T cells were obtained from the\nAmerican Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (CRL-11268). TZM-bl and 293T\ncells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) with\n10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), 50 units/mL penicillin, and\n50 μg/mL streptomycin. PM1 cells were grown in Roswell Park Memorial\nInstitute (RPMI) 1640 medium with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin.\nDTG and BIC were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto,\nCanada) (D528800 and B382095, respectively).\n\n### Recombinant integrase protein expression and purification.\n\nR263K and G118R coding mutations were combined via site-directed\nmutagenesis using the previously described G118R primers and pET15b-INB\n~R263K~ plasmid ( 27 ). Plasmids were amplified in XL-10 Gold bacteria\n(Stratagene), and proper mutagenesis was verified by Sanger sequencing.\nThe resulting pET15b-INB ~G118R+R263K~ plasmid was transformed in\nparallel with pET15b-INB ~R263K,~ pET15b-INB ~G118R~ , and pET15b-INB\n~WT~ into BL21(DE3) bacterial cells to produce recombinant integrase\nproteins, using methods described previously ( 13 , 14 , 23 , 27 , 28 ,\n35 , -- 37 ). Transformed BL21 cells were grown overnight at 37°C in\nLuria-Bertani (LB) broth with 100 μg/mL ampicillin, in 5-mL shaken\nprecultures. Sixteen to 20 h later, the precultures were used to seed\ncultures in 500 mL LB with ampicillin. Bacterial growth was monitored\nuntil the optical density at 600 nm (OD ~600~ ) reached 0.4 to 0.6, when\n1 mM isopropyl-β- d -1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to the\nculture to induce integrase protein expression for 2 h at 37°C.\nBacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation, dried, and frozen at\n−80°C for 16 to 20 h. All subsequent procedures were conducted on ice or\nat 4°C. Recombinant integrase proteins were expressed in fusion with a\npolyhistidine tag that permitted their purification via its interaction\nwith nickel-nitriloacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose beads. Pellets were\nthawed and lysed by sonication in prechilled 1 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole,\n50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 500 μM MgCl ~2~ , 500 μM MnCl ~2~ , 2 mM\ndithiothreitol (DTT), 50 μM ZnCl ~2~ , supplemented with complete\nEDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche). Cell lysates were bound to Ni-NTA\nagarose beads for 1 h with agitation at 4°C. Elution was performed using\npolypropylene columns and increasing concentrations of imidazole (0 to 2\nM) at 4°C. Fractions with purified full-length integrase proteins were\nidentified by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, digested with\nthrombin (Sigma) as described previously ( 38 ), and dialyzed against a\nstorage buffer (20 mM HEPES \\[pH 7.5\\], 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT,\n10% glycerol) for 16 to 20 h, using a molecular weight cutoff value of\n30 kDa to remove the His tag. Dialyzed proteins were checked by SDS-PAGE\nfollowed by Coomassie staining, which showed that full-length\nrecombinant integrase proteins were consistently \\>90% pure (see Fig. S1\nin the supplemental material). Purified proteins were stored at −80°C\nfor several months without loss of activity. The WT, G118R, R263K, and\nG118R plus R263K recombinant proteins were purified simultaneously in\nparallel to ensure that the same buffers and conditions applied to\ndifferent enzymes. We purified two separate batches of WT, G118R, R263K,\nand G118R plus R263K integrase proteins to ensure the reproducibility of\nour cell-free experiments. Strand transfer and DNA binding assays were\nperformed with the two protein batches, and results were compiled after\nnormalization, which was performed as detailed below.\n\n### Integrase strand transfer assays.\n\nThe target DNA for integration was prepared by annealing the\noligonucleotides 5′- *TGACCAAGGGCTAATTCACT* -3′-biotin and 5′-\n*AGTGAATTAGCCCTTGGTCA* -3′-biotin (target DNA) using low-chelating\nTris-EDTA (TE) buffer. The same method was used to produce preprocessed\nHIV-1 LTR DNA with the oligonucleotides 5′-Am-MC12-\n*ACCCTTTTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCA* -3′ and 5′-\n*ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGACTAAAAG* -3′, where Am-MC12 indicates a\nreactive amino group linked to the DNA by 12 carbon atoms. This LTR DNA\nhad a 2-nucleotide 5′ staggered end and mimicked the 3′-processed HIV-1\nDNA LTR that is the target for integrase. By using this substrate, we\nensured that our assay measured only strand transfer. Another enzymatic\nactivity of integrase, called 3′-processing, was not assessed. First,\nannealed preprocessed LTR DNA (100 nM) was linked covalently to DNA-BIND\n96-well plates (2498; Corning) in PBS (pH 7.4) for 4 h at room\ntemperature. Unbound DNA was removed, and the plates' reactive surface\nwas blocked by incubation with 0.5% FBS in PBS overnight at 4°C. The\nfollowing day, DNA-coated plates were washed twice with 200 μL of PBS\n(pH 7.4) and assay buffer (50 mM morpholinopropanesulfonic acid \\[MOPS\\]\n\\[pH 6.8\\], 50 μg/mL bovine serum albumin \\[BSA\\], 50 mM NaCl, 30 mM\nMgCl ~2~ , 0.15%\n3-\\[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio\\]-1-propanesulfonate \\[CHAPS\\]).\nPurified integrase proteins were thawed on ice, diluted to their working\nconcentrations in assay buffer with 5 mM DTT, and added to the\nDNA-coated plates within 15 min (100 μL/well), with three wells per\ncondition. Annealed target double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) was diluted in\nassay buffer and added to the plates (50 μL). Strand transfer reactions\nwere allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37°C. Negative controls included\nwells without LTR DNA, integrase proteins, or target DNA. After strand\ntransfer, the plates were washed three times with 200 μL 50 mM Tris-HCl\n(pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 2 mg/mL BSA, to remove the free\ntarget DNA. Covalently bound biotinylated target DNA was detected by\nadding 0.025 μg/mL Eu-labeled streptavidin (1244-360; Perkin Elmer) and\n50 μM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic dianhydride (DTPA) (284-025;\nSigma-Aldrich) diluted in wash buffer. After two washes with the wash\nbuffer, 150 μL DELFIA enhancement solution (4001-0010; Perkin Elmer) was\nadded to the plate, and the time-resolved fluorescence was measured on a\nFLUOStar Optima plate reader. Experiments were performed with two\nseparate batches of purified recombinant proteins, twice for experiments\nwith different integrase protein concentrations (25, 50, 100, 200, 400,\n800, and 1,600 nM) plus 60 nM target DNA and three times for experiments\nwith a fixed integrase protein concentration (400 nM) and different\ntarget DNA concentrations (1.875, 3.75, 7.5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 nM).\nFluorescence values were normalized against results obtained with 400 nM\nWT protein (arbitrarily set at 100%) for each experiment in which we\nvaried protein concentrations. For the experiments in which we varied\nthe target DNA concentrations, fluorescence values were normalized\nagainst those obtained with the WT protein plus 120 nM target DNA\n(arbitrarily set at 100%) for each experiment. This normalization\nallowed us to compile the results from repeat experiments with two\ndifferent batches of recombinant proteins. The combined normalized\nresults obtained with various target DNA concentrations were fitted to\nbinding saturation curves and used to determine the enzymatic parameters\nreported in Table 1 , namely, the maximal integration (pseudo- *V* ~max~\n), half-maximal substrate concentration (pseudo- *K ~m~* ), and\nenzymatic efficiency (pseudo- *V* ~max~ /pseudo- *K ~m~* ).\n\n### DNA binding assay.\n\nWe measured the direct interactions between purified recombinant\nintegrase proteins and HIV LTR DNA using a previously published protocol\n( 20 , 21 , 23 ). The HIV LTR-mimetic dsDNA was prepared by annealing\nthe oligonucleotides 5′- *CTTTTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT* -3′ and\n5′-RhoR- *ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGACTAAAAG* -3′, where RhoR stands for\nrhodamine red. Annealing was performed in low-chelating TE buffer, as\ndescribed previously ( 27 ). Purified recombinant integrase proteins\nwere thawed on ice and immobilized on 96-well high-bind microplates\n(3925; Corning) overnight at 4°C. Unbound proteins were washed away\ntwice with PBS (pH 7.4), and plates were blocked with 5% BSA\n(Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 2 h. Excess BSA was removed with two PBS\nwashes, and plates were equilibrated with 150 μL binding buffer (20 mM\nMOPS \\[pH 7.2\\], 20 mM NaCl, 7.5 mM MgCl ~2~ , 5 mM DTT). Various\nconcentrations of dsDNA substrate (0 to 535 nM in 1:2 serial dilutions)\nwere added, followed by 1 h of incubation at room temperature. After\nthree washes with PBS, 100 μL PBS was added to each well, and\nRhoR-mediated fluorescence was measured at 544-nm excitation and 590-nm\nemission wavelengths using a FLUOStar Optima plate reader. Background\nfluorescence from integrase-negative wells was subtracted to yield\nspecific relative fluorescent units. Each data point was produced in\ntriplicate (three separate wells). Two batches of enzymes were used, and\nresults were compiled via normalization against DNA binding values\nobtained with the WT protein and 120 nM viral DNA, arbitrarily set at 1.\nResults were plotted against DNA concentrations, binding saturation\ncurves were produced using GraphPad Prism v9 software, and binding\naffinity ( *K ~d~* ) values were derived from these curves.\n\n### Virus production.\n\nThe pNL4.3-INB ~G118R+R263K~ plasmid was derived from the pNL4.3-INB\n~R263K~ plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis, as described above. Proper\nsite-directed mutagenesis was validated by Sanger sequencing. The\npNL4.3-INB ~G118R~ and pNL4.3-INB ~R263K~ plasmids have been described\nelsewhere ( 14 ). WT, G118R, R263K, and G118R plus R263K HIV-1 viruses\nwere produced by transfection in 293T cells ( 13 ). Briefly, 7.5 million\n293T cells were seeded on day 0 in a 75-cm ^2^ flask in Opti-MEM\nsupplemented with 10% FBS without antibiotics. Eighteen to 24 h later,\ncells were checked to have reached approximately 75% confluence.\nTwenty-five micrograms of proviral plasmid DNA was transfected using\n150 μL of Lipofectamine 2000, according to the manufacturer's\nrecommendations. Four hours after transfection, cell culture medium was\nrenewed with Opti-MEM with 10% FBS. Virus production for 48 h was\nfollowed by the harvesting of the cell culture fluids (12 mL).\nSupernatants were centrifuged for 10 min at 3,500 rpm, decanted to a new\n15-mL tube, and filtered gently through a 0.2-μm filter with a 15-mL\nsyringe. Filtered viruses were treated with benzonase (Millipore),\naliquoted into 500 μL aliquots, and frozen at −80°C for at least 24 h\nbefore they were used for infectivity assays and RT quantification.\n\n### Cell-based single-cycle infectivity assays.\n\nInfectivity and resistance assays were performed as described via\nsingle-round infections of reporter TZM-bl cells ( 23 ). For infectivity\nassays, 30,000 TZM-bl cells were plated in 50 μL DMEM supplemented with\n10% FBS plus penicillin-streptomycin in 96-well white opaque cell\nculture plates. Sixteen to 24 h later, viral stocks were rapidly thawed\nat 37°C and serially diluted 1:3 in DMEM with 10% FBS and\npenicillin-streptomycin 10 times, and 50 μL/well was added to TZM-bl\ncells in triplicate. Outside wells were filled with 200 μL/well of\nsterile PBS to limit evaporation. Twenty-four hours later, cell culture\nmedium was removed by aspiration, and 60 μL reporter lysis buffer\n(Promega) was added to each well. Within 15 min, 30 μL lysate was\ntransferred to a 96-well white opaque plate, and 30 μL of luciferase\nreagent (Promega) was added. Plates were immediately analyzed for\nluminescence on a MicroBetaTriLux microplate luminescence counter\n(Perkin-Elmer). Each data point was produced in triplicate. Relative\nluminescence units (RLUs) were plotted against viral titers and\nnormalized using GraphPad Prism v 9.4.1 (GraphPad Software, LLC), with\nmaximal and minimal luminescence arbitrarily set at 100% and 0%,\nrespectively. This allowed us to compile the results from three separate\nexperiments, two with the same virus batch and another one with a\nseparate batch of viruses. In all cases, experiments were performed with\nall viruses simultaneously.\n\n### Antiretroviral drug susceptibility.\n\nFor antiretroviral drug susceptibility assays, a similar approach was\nused with some modifications. Thirty thousand TZM-bl cells per well were\nplated on a 96-well cell culture plate. Eighteen to 24 h later, 1:10\nserial dilutions of DTG (0.16 pM to 1.6 μM) or BIC (0.14 pM to 1.4 μM)\nwere added to the cells in triplicate. After 1 h of incubation, the\ncells were infected with the equivalent of 30,000 RT units of WT, G118R,\nR263K, or G118R plus R263K virus per well, as reported previously ( 23\n). After 24 h, luciferase production was measured as described above,\nand RLU values were plotted against drug concentrations. Normalization\nwas performed as described above for infectivity assays using GraphPad\nPrism. The results from three separate experiments (two with one batch\nof viruses and one with another batch of viruses) were compiled thanks\nto normalization. This compilation was used to calculate FCs in 50%\ninhibitory concentrations (IC ~50~ s) relative to the WT virus using\nGraphPad Prism.\n\n### Multicycle replication assays.\n\nThe ability of the WT, G118R, R263K, and G118R plus R263K viruses to\nreplicate over time was tested by infecting PM1 cells and measuring the\nRT activity released in the cell culture fluids 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 16,\n18, and 20 days postinfection. Briefly, 30,000 PM1 cells per well were\nplated in triplicate in a 96-well plate. Eighteen to 20 h later, the\ncells were infected with the equivalent of 30,000 RT units per well for\n1 h. Unbound viruses were removed, and 200 μL fresh complete RPMI 1640\nmedium was added to the cells. At the indicated time, 100 μL of\ncell-free medium was collected for RT quantification, and 10,000\nuninfected PM1 cells in 100 μL fresh medium were added. This experiment\nwas performed twice, with two different viral preparations. To compile\nthe results of the two experiments, RT values were normalized against\nresults for the WT virus at day 11, arbitrarily set at 100%. Compiled\nnormalized RT results were plotted against time, and areas under the\ncurves were calculated using GraphPad Prism and expressed relative to\nthe value for the WT virus as relative replicative capacity.\n\n### Molecular modeling.\n\nThe tetrameric integrase complex with DNA and BIC (PDB code 6PUW ) was\nused as a template to examine the effects of G118R on the integrase\nstructure ( 6 ). *In silico* modeling effects of the individual R263K\nand G118R substitutions have been published previously ( 14 , 18 , 27 ).\nWe used a published approach to examine the structure of the G118R\nmutant by modeling the mutated protein against chain A from PDB code\n6PUW ( 18 , 27 ). Proper conformation was validated by pairwise\nstructure alignment on the RCSB PDB website (\nhttps://www.rcsb.org/alignment ). We used AceDock to model BIC binding\nto the G118R-mutated integrase ( 39 ). Visualization and illustration\ncreation were performed using Maestro v2022-2 software (Schrodinger\nLLC).\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 36347497\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \" 3.3. Molecular virology\n\nClonal analysis of retroviruses circulating at month 36 showed that M184V and integrase mutations co-existed on single viral genomes in 42% of viruses (not shown).

Although the primary H51Y substitution did not confer resistance against DTG or RAL (FC values of 1.25 and 0.98, respectively), consistent with previous results ( 11 ), the addition of R262K did result in low-level but significant biochemical resistance to DTG but not to RAL (FC values of 1.9 and 0.92, respectively).\"\nRationale: The paper includes in vitro drug susceptibility data, specifically examining the susceptibility of HIV-1 to dolutegravir (DTG) and raltegravir (RAL) using short-term resistance assays with TZM-bl cells.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 25552724\nQuestion ID: 13\nQuestion: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\nEvidence: Generation of recombinant HIV subtype C and CRF02_AG integrase enzymes.

Key amino acid changes observed in these selection studies are presented in Table 1.

As in previous studies, protein calibration confirmed that maximum protein activity occurred with 300 nM protein for all subtypes (not shown). Therefore, subsequent experiments utilized 300 nM integrase protein.

However, despite the\nintroduction of these drugs, data concerning their resistance mutations\n(RMs) is still limited in Ethiopia. Thus, this study aimed to assess\nINSTI RMs and polymorphisms at the gene locus coding for Integrase (IN)\namong viral isolates from ART-naive HIV-1 infected Ethiopian population.\nThis was a cross-sectional study involving isolation of HIV-1 from\nplasma of 49 newly diagnosed drug-naive HIV-1 infected individuals in\nAddis-Ababa during the period between June to December 2018. The IN\nregion covering the first 263 codons of blood samples was amplified and\nsequenced using an in-house assay. INSTIs RMs were examined using\ncalibrated population resistance tool version 8.0 from Stanford HIV drug\nresistance database while both REGA version 3 online HIV-1 subtyping\ntool and the jumping profile Hidden Markov Model from GOBICS were used\nto examine HIV-1 genetic diversity. Among the 49 study participants, 1\n(1/49; 2%) harbored a major INSTIs RM (R263K). In addition, blood\nspecimens from 14 (14/49; 28.5%) patients had accessory mutations. Among\nthese, the M50I accessory mutation was observed in a highest frequency\n(13/49; 28.3%) followed by L74I (1/49; 2%), S119R (1/49; 2%), and S230N\n(1/49; 2%). Concerning HIV-1 subtype distribution, all the entire study\nsubjects were detected to harbor HIV-1C strain as per the IN gene\nanalysis. This study showed that the level of primary HIV-1 drug\nresistance to INSTIs is still low in Ethiopia reflecting the cumulative\nnatural occurrence of these mutations in the absence of selective drug\npressure and supports the use of INSTIs in the country. However,\ncontinues monitoring of drug resistance should be enhanced since the\nvirus potentially develop resistance to this drug classes as time goes\nby.\n\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Study population\n\nThis is a cross-sectional health facility-based study involving\ndrug-naive HIV-1 infected study participants. Study participants who\nwere asymptomatic at the time of recruitment, above the age of 18, and\nwilling to take part in the study were sequentially enrolled. This\nresearch did not include pregnant women, those with known chronic\nconditions, or anyone who had ever used ART. For detailed patients\nscreening and enrollment, please refer to our previous publication\n^^14^^ . Accordingly, forty-nine volunteered adult (≥ 18 years old)\nstudy participants from voluntary VCT centers in Addis Ababa were\nconsecutively enrolled in this study from June to December 2018. Blood\nsamples (10 ml) were collected at the time of HIV diagnosis before\ninitiation of ART for genotypic assay of the IN gene region from these\nparticipants using an EDTA tube. Plasma was then separated by\ncentrifugation for 10 min at 3000 rpm and stored in deep freeze\n(− 80 °C) till required for laboratory investigation.\n\n### Nucleic acid extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing\n\nViral RNA extraction and viral load were performed consecutively from\n200 μL of thawed participants\\' plasma sample input using the Abbott\nReal-time HIV-1 M2000 system (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, USA).\nFor sequencing purpose, cDNA was synthesized from the extracted RNA in a\n20 microliter (µL) reaction mixture using Superscript IV Reverse\nTranscriptase enzyme and HIVpcrRev1 primer (Table ​ (Table1). 1 ). The\nmixture constituted; 1 µL of HIVpcrRev1 outer primer, 1 µL of dNTPs, 1\nµL of DDT, 1 µL of RiboLock, 4 µL of 5X superscript IV buffer, 1 µL of\nsuperscript IV (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA, USA), 5 µL of RNA, and 6 µL of\nmolecular grade water. The thermal cycling for this cDNA synthesis was;\n50 °C for 1 h ^^13^^ .\n\n\nThis was followed by a first-round PCR, which was performed in a 50 µL\nreaction mix composed of 1 µL of each outer primer (HIVpcr For1 and\nHIVpcr Rev1; Table ​ Table1), 1 ), 27.8 µL of nuclease‐free water, 10 µL\nof 5X GoTaq buffer, 4 µL of 25 mM MgCl ~2~ , 1 µL of 10 mM dNTPs, 0.2 µL\nof GoTaq polymerase (Promega, USA), and 5 µL of cDNA. The PCR cycling\nconditions were 98 °C for 2 min followed by 39 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C,\n25 s at 64 °C, 40 s at 72 °C, and a final extension of 72 °C for 5 min\n^^13^^ .\n\nThe DNA product from the first round PCR was then re-amplified by a\nnested PCR. This nested PCR was carried out in another 50 µL reaction\nmix utilizing 1 µL of the first-round PCR product, 1 µL of each inner\nprimer (HIVpcr For2 and HIVpcr Rev2; Table ​ Table1), 1 ), 31.8 µL of\nnuclease‐free water, 10 µL of 5X GoTaq buffer, 4 µL of 25 mM MgCl ~2~ ,\n1 µL of 10 mM dNTPs, and 0.2 µL of GoTaq polymerase (Promega, USA). This\nfinal re-amplified PCR product (793 bp) was verified by agarose gel\nelectrophoresis (using 1.5% agarose gel) and was then purified\nconsecutively using the GenepHlow™ Gel/PCR Kit (Geneaid biotech ltd.,\nTaiwan), following the manufacturer's instruction. Purified amplicons\nwere then sequenced with Sanger DNA sequencing using the BigDye\nTerminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems), and run on\nthe ABI PRISM® 3500 xL automated Genetic Analyzer. At each step of the\nlaboratory procedures, both positive and negative controls were\nincorporated in order to keep the procedures quality assurance.\n\n### Primary INSTI resistance mutation analysis and HIV-1 subtype determination\n\nSequences were first collected from the ABI PRISM® 3500 xL automated\nGenetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and transferred to separate\npersonal computer. Sequence edition and alignment were then made using\nGeneious prime® software v.2020.2.1 ( https://www.geneious.com/academic/\n). The quality of the sequence data was checked using an online sequence\nquality control tool found in the Los Alamos HIV sequence database (\nhttp://hiv-web.lanl.gov ). Calibrated Population Resistance (CPR) tool\nversion 8.0, which is available at Stanford University HIV Drug\nResistance Database (HIVdb) ( http://cpr.standford.edu/cpr/index.html )\nwas used to assess the drug RMs. The susceptibility of HIV to ARV drugs\nwas determined using the HIVdb program ( http://hivdb.stanford.edu ).\n\nAll sequences were thoroughly examined for the presence of primary\nmutations, nonpolymorphic \\[NoP\\] and polymorphic mutations associated\nwith resistance to INSTI. Each aminoacid prevalence at each IN position\nwas calculated and compared to the HIV-1 subtype B reference sequence\n(GenBank accession number: K03455 ). For this study, NoP was defined as\nsubstitutions within the HIV-1 IN that occurred in ≥ 1% of the\nsequences. Positions with ≥ 20% substitutions were considered as highly\npolymorphic, while those with ≤ 0.5% substitution were considered highly\nconserved.\n\nHIV-1 subtype determination was performed using two online HIV-1\nsubtyping tools; the REGA version 3 online HIV-1 subtyping tool from the\nStanford HIVdb ( http://hivdb.stanford.edu ) and the jumping profile\nHidden Markov Model (jpHHM) at GOBICS ( http://jphmm.gobics.de/ ). The\nsubtypes were also further confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using\nreference sequences from Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV Sequence\nDatabase ( http://hiv-web.lanl.gov ). The analysis was made using\nMolecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) v.10.0.5 software ^^15^^\n.\n\n### Statistical analyses\n\nEpi data v3.1 software was used for data entry while SPSS version 25.0\n(SPSS Inc. the United States) was used for analysis. A logistic\nregression model was used to determine the presence of any associations\nbetween drug RMs and sociodemographic variables. Thus, variables having\na *p* value \\< 0.05 were considered to have a statistically significant\nassociation. All isolates are deposited in GenBank with accession number\nMW560010 to MW560058 .\n\n### Ethics approval and consent to participate\n\nThis study was approved by the institutional ethical review committee of\nthe Armauer Hansen Research Institute (Protocol Number: PO16/18). All\nparticipants provided their written informed consent to participate in\nthis study and that this study was conducted following the declaration\nof Helsinki.\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Characteristics of the study population\n\nNear full-length HIV-1 IN region, (263 codons) of the 49 study\nparticipants were successfully sequenced and analyzed. Of these, 59.2%\n(n = 29) were females (Table ​ (Table2). 2 ). The mean ± SD age of the\nparticipants was 32 ± 1.2 years ranging from 20 to 57 years old. The\nmedian (IQR) viral load was 69,625 copies/mL (32,219--208,299). The\ndetailed demographic and clinical information of the study participants\nis summarized in Table ​ Table2 2 .\n\n\n### The level of primary INSTI resistance mutation and HIV-1 Subtype distribution\n\nAs per the INSTI RMs analysis, one (n = 1/49; 2%) participant harbored\none major INSTIs RM R263K (Fig. 2 .). Concerning the HIV-1 subtype\ndistribution, both the REGA version 3 online HIV-1 subtyping tool and\nthe jumping profile Hidden Markov Model from GOBICS indicated that the\nentire 49 subjects were harboring HIV-1C virus as per the IN\nregion analysis. This was further confirmed by a maximum likelihood\nphylogenetic analysis along with the reference sequences (A--K) and CRFs\nfrom the Los Alamos National Library database ( www.lanl.gov ) (Fig. 1\n.). As indicated in the phylogenetic tree, sequences from this study\nwith GenBank accession number ( MW560010 to MW560058 ) were clustered\nwith HIV-1C with a bootstrap value of 93% (Fig. 1 ).\n\nFigure 1\n\nMaximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of the HIV-1 integrase sequences\nfrom the 49 drug-naive HIV-infected individuals. The ML tree was\nconstructed using MEGA version 10.0.5 with the Kimura 2 parameter.\nBootstrapping was performed with 1,000 replicates and only those that\nhave a bootstrap value \\> 70% are shown on the tree. HIV-1 reference\nsequences (A---K and CRFs) that were retrieved from the HIV-1 LANL HIV\nSequence Database (green color) are indicated by subtype followed by the\ncorresponding country name, year, and accession number. All of the\nsequences from this study that are indicated in blue color (\nMW560010-MW560058 ) were clustered with HIV-1 subtype C strain with a\nbootstrap value of 93%. The one sequence ( MW560010 ) that harbored a\nmajor INSTI RM R263K is shown with a red rectangular node. *INSTI*\nIntegrase strand transfer inhibitor, *LANL* Los alamos national library,\n*MEGA* Molecular evolutionary genetics analysis, *ML* Maximum\nlikelihood.\n\nFigure 2\n\nFrequency of major and accessory INSTI-RMs detected. The major INSTI-RM\nwas R263K while the accessory RMs were M50I, L74I, S119R, and S230N.\n*RMs* Resistance mutations.\n\n### Accessory INSTI RMs and/or polymorphisms\n\nBesides the major INSTI RM observed, 14 (14/49; 28.5%) patients in the\ncurrent study harbored at least one accessory RMs. Among these, almost\n93% of the accessory mutations observed were M50I (13/49; 28.3%)\nfollowed by L74I (1/49; 2%), S119R (1/49; 2%), and S230N (1/49; 2%)\n(Fig. 2 .). Two patients had two simultaneous accessory RMs (M50I and\nS119R; M50I and S230N). Furthermore, other naturally occurring\npolymorphisms that indicate variability between HIV-1 subtypes were also\nobserved.\n\n\n\n## Discussions\n\nINSTIs have rapidly become an important class in the arsenal of ARV\ndrugs due to their higher genetic barrier ^^6^\\ ,\\ ^16^^ . The world\nhealth organization (WHO) recommended one of the INSTI drugs, DTG, as a\npreferred first-line ART in 2017 ^^17^^ . This drug classes is now\nbecoming the best choice in many countries due to an increase in\nresistance rates against NNRTIs, NRTIs as well as PIs in the past years\n^^18^^ .\n\nIn Ethiopia, where no routine genotyping testing nor routine drug\nresistance surveillance is present, this drug was introduced in 2018\nfollowing the aforementioned WHO recommendation ^^12^^ . However,\nstudies on primary HIV-1 drug resistance related to these drugs are\nlimited in the country. So far, only a single study that indicated a\nlack of a major INSTI RM was reported ^^13^^ . Therefore, the current\nstudy was intended to provide an update on INSTI RM prevalence among\nuntreated HIV-1 infected people in Ethiopia after 10 years of a previous\nstudy ^^13^^ . Accordingly, this study found out that the prevalence of\nbaseline major INSTI RM among untreated patients is 2%. This observation\nof low level resistance is in line with the previous studies from\nEthiopia ^^13^^ , Brazil ^^19^^ , South Africa ^^18^\\ ,\\ ^20^^ , India\n^^21^^ , Cameroon ^^22^^ , Europe ^^23^^ , and Taiwan ^^4^^ .\n\nThe only major INSTI RM detected in the current study is a\nnon-polymorphic mutation R263K that can be selected in vivo during\na treatment with DTG and RAL, where it is capable of causing a 2 to\n5-fold reduction in susceptibility to DTG, EVG, and RAL ^^6^^ . In\naddition, R263K has been observed to be selected in vitro under pressure\nwith BIC and the INSTI investigational drug CAB ^^6^^ .\n\nCompared to high-income settings, where it is primarily associated with\nsubtype B-infected individuals treated with ABC/3TC/DTG, this R263K\nmutation, along with other DTG RMs, is reported to be more common in\nlow-middle-income settings, where patients with treatment failure use an\nalternative NRTI drug class, leading to the accumulation of multi-NRTI\nresistance ^^24^^ .\n\nIn this study, we have also further detected accessory RMs that have\nlittle effect unless they present with other major mutations. The\noverall magnitude of these polymorphic accessory RMs was 28.5%, which is\nhigher than detection rate in studies from Cameroon 8.1--10%\n^^22^\\ ,\\ ^25^^ , India 10.1% ^^26^^ , and sub-Saharan Africa 8.7%\n^^27^^ . Among the minor RMs detected in the current study, M50I was the\nmost common accessory RMs (13 of the 14 (93%) minor mutations detected\nfrom 13/49 (28.3%) participants, which is in line with the magnitude of\nits global distribution ^^28^^ (Fig. 3 ). Moreover, this detection rate\nis higher relative to the report from previous study in Ethiopia ^^13^^\n, indicating the increases this variant\\'s circulation in the country.\nM50I polymorphic mutation is selected in vitro by DTG and BIC in\ncombination with R263K, a combination that appears to reduce DTG\nsusceptibility ^^6^^ .\n\nFigure 3\n\nComparision on accessory mutations.\n\nThe other minor RMs detected were L74I (1/49; 2%), S119R (1/49; 2%), and\nS230N (1/49; 2%). L74M alone has minimal, if any, effect on INSTI\nsusceptibility. However, they contribute to reduced susceptibility to\neach of the INSTIs when present in combination with major mutations\n^^6^^ . S119R is a polymorphic mutation that is weakly selected by\nINSTIs usually in combination with several major INSTI-associated\ndrug RMs. Alone, it has little, if any effect, on INSTI susceptibility\n^^28^^ . While all these three accessory RMs were previously reported\nfrom other countries like South Africa ^^18^^ and India ^^28^^ in line\nwith the current study, only the former (L74I) was detected previously\nin Ethiopia ^^13^^ . The overall comparative summary of these accessory\nmutations detected in the current study with HIV-1 isolates from\nuntreated patients from South Africa ^^18^^ , India ^^28^^ , Ethiopia\n^^13^^ , and worldwide ^^28^^ is presented in Fig. 3 .\n\nRegarding the HIV-1 integrase diversity observed, this study found out\nthat all 49 (100%) study subjects harbored HIV-1C subtype, which is in\nline with previous reports from Ethiopia. This confirms that the HIV-1\nstrain circulation in Ethiopia is still dominated by HIV-1C despite the\nearly introduction of the clade ^^29^^ .\n\n\n\n## Conclusions and recommendations\n\nIn conclusion, this study confirmed homogeneity in the circulating HIV-1\nclade C and indicated that the level of primary HIV-1 resistance to\nINSTIs among treatment naive population is still low in Ethiopia, which\nsupports the use of INSTIs in the country. However, the observation from\nthis study does not support the need for performing INSTI resistance\ntesting at baseline, as the prevalence is low. Nevertheless, further\nlarger studies are necessary to assess the impact of accessory INSTI RMs\non INSTI-based ART regimens.\n\n\n\n## Funding\n\nThis research project was funded by the Armauer Hansen Research\nInstitute (AHRI).\n\n\n## Data availability\n\nAll nucleotide sequences from this study have been deposited in the\nGenbank (ncbi) repository with accession numbers from MW560010 to\nMW560058 .\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 36578581\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \" Abstract\n\nIntegrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-containing regimens in HIV-1-infected patients have experienced a global increase. Recently, WHO has emphasized the need to fast-track the transition to dolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral (ARV) treatments. However, continued surveillance of INSTI resistance is recommended. In this study, clinical, epidemiological, and virological features associated with INSTI resistance diagnosed in Spain were analyzed. Samples collected between 2008 and 2021 from HIV-1-infected patients were analyzed in integrase, protease, and reverse transcriptase using Sanger population sequencing. ARV drug resistance was evaluated with the Stanford University HIVdb program. Among 2,696 patients, 174 (6.5%) had INSTI resistance, all of them to first-generation INSTIs, and 71 (2.6%) had also resistance to second-generation INSTIs. Of these, only 5 individuals were exposed to DTG as the only INSTI, in whom resistance development was associated with poor treatment adherence and/or resistance to other ARV classes. Of newly HIV-1-diagnosed individuals, 0.92% harbored INSTI-resistant viruses, with low prevalences maintained along time, and only one had low-level resistance to DTG. Persons who inject drugs, age over 39 years, resistance to other ARV classes, and longer time from diagnosis were associated with INSTI resistance (p < 0.001). Non-subtype B INSTI-resistant viruses lacked the Q148H + G140S resistance pathway and showed lower INSTI resistance levels than subtype B viruses. In conclusion, INSTI resistance is uncommon and associated with long-term infections, older age and additional resistance to other ARV drug classes, and is rare in newly diagnosed HIV-1 infections. Our results also support the preferential use of DTG-containing regimens in first-line treatments, although surveillance of INSTI resistance is encouraged.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the analysis of drug resistance mutations and their prevalence in patient samples, but it does not mention conducting in vitro drug susceptibility tests.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 36298841\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: In an effort to evaluate the accuracy of HIV-1 phylogenies based on genomes of increasing length, we developed a comprehensive near-full-length HIV-1 genome RT–PCR assay and performed a comparative evaluation via phylogenetic analyses. To this end, we conducted comparative analyses of HIV-1 phylogenies derived based on HIV-1 PR/RT (2253–3359 in the HXB2 genome) and pol region (2253–5250 in the HXB2 genome) sequences isolated from 134 HIV-1-infected patients in Cyprus (2017–2019). The HIV-1 genotypic subtypes determined using six subtyping tools (REGA 3.0, COMET 2.3, jpHMM, SCUEAL, Stanford, and Geno2pheno) were compared to investigate the discrepancies generated among different tools. To evaluate the accuracy of defined HIV-1 phylogenies, the samples exhibiting at least one discrepant subtyping result among different subtyping tools in both PR/RT and pol regions or only in the pol region (n = 38) were selected for near-full-length HIV-1 genome (790–8795 in HXB2 genome) sequencing using a newly developed RT–PCR/sequencing assay. The obtained sequences were employed for HIV-1 genotypic subtype determination and subjected to comparative phylogenetic-based analyses. It was observed that 39.6% of the 134 samples presented discrepancies in the PR/RT region, while 28.4% presented discrepancies in the pol region. REGA 3.0 produced the fewest discrepancies collectively in both regions and was selected for subsequent subtyping and comparative phylogenetic analyses of near-full-length HIV-1 genome sequences. The analyses of near-full-length HIV-1 genome sequences identified 68.4% of the 38 ‘discrepant samples’ (n = 26) as belonging to uncharacterized recombinant HIV-1 strains, while 21.1% were circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) (n = 8) and 10.5% belonged to pure group M subtypes (n = 4). The findings demonstrated a significant reduction of 11.2% in discrepancies when pol region sequences were used compared to PR/RT region sequences, indicating that increased nucleotide sequence lengths are directly correlated with more consistent subtype classification. The results also revealed that if the discrepancy in pol region subtyping results persists, then there is a high likelihood (89.5%) that the query sequence is a recombinant HIV-1 strain, 68.4% of which belong to uncharacterized recombinant HIV-1 strains. The results of this study showed that REGA 3.0 presented the best performance in subtyping recombinant HIV-1 strains, while Stanford performed better in defining phylogenies of pure group M subtypes. The study highlights that, especially in populations with polyphyletic HIV-1 epidemics resulting in a high prevalence of recombinant HIV-1 strains, neither PR/RT nor pol region sequences are reliable for the determination of HIV-1 genotypic subtypes in samples showing discrepancies among different subtyping tools, and only near-full-length or full-length HIV-1 genome sequences are sufficiently accurate.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the phylogenetic analysis and subtyping of HIV-1 sequences from patient samples.

Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

We determined the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity in Bulgaria during 2012--2020 using polymerase sequences from 1053 of 2010 (52.4%) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. Sequences were analyzed for DRM using the WHO HIV SDRM list implemented in the calculated population resistance tool at Stanford University. Genetic diversity was inferred using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetics. Cluster detection and characterization was performed using MicrobeTrace. The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%). Most (34/60, 56.7%) of the SDRMs were present in transmission clusters of different subtypes composed mostly of male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC), including a 14-member cluster of subtype B sequences from 12 MMSC and two males reporting heterosexual contact; 13 had the L90M PI mutation and one had the T215S NRTI SDRM. We found a low SDRM prevalence amid high HIV-1 diversity among ART-naive patients in Bulgaria during 2012--2020. The majority of SDRMs were found in transmission clusters containing MMSC, indicative of onward spread of SDRM in drug-naive individuals. Our study provides valuable information on the transmission dynamics of HIV drug resistance in the context of high genetic diversity in Bulgaria, for the development of enhanced prevention strategies to end the epidemic.\n\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity using sequences from ART-naive individuals. It does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing or data.\nAnswer: No"}

Sanger and ultra-deep\nsequencing (UDS) were performed on the HIV-1 genome (Illumina\ntechnology) according to the ANRS consensus. A generalized estimation\nequation with a Poisson distribution was used to compare changes in the\nproportion of residual viraemia, detectable semen HIV RNA and HIV DNA\nwithin and between the two groups over time.\n\nResults\n\nThe proportion of participants with residual viraemia at Day 0 (D0) and\nWeek 48 (W48) was 16.7% and 25.0% in the 4/7 days group and 22.4% and\n29.7% in the 7/7 days group, respectively (+8.3% versus +7.3%, *P* =\n0.971). The proportion of detectable DNA (\\>40 copies/10 ^6^ cells) at\nD0 and W48 was 53.7% and 57.4% in the 4/7 days group and 56.1% and 51.8%\nin the 7/7 days group, respectively (+3.7% versus −4.3%, *P* = 0.358).\nSemen HIV RNA was detectable (≥100 copies/mL) in 2.2% of participants at\nD0 and 4.5% at W48 in the 4/7 days group versus 6.1% and 9.1% in the 7/7\ndays group, respectively (+2.3% versus +3.0%, *P* = 0.743). Emerging\nresistance at failure was more frequent in the 4/7 days group detected\nby Sanger sequencing: 3/6 participants versus 1/4 in the 7/7 days group,\nand similar with the UDS assay: 5/6 versus 4/4, respectively.\n\nConclusions\n\nThese findings support the potency of a 4/7 days maintenance strategy on\nvirological suppression at the reservoirs and emergent resistance level,\nincluding minority variants.\n\n\n## Participants and methods\n\n### Participants\n\nANRS 170 QUATUOR was an open-label, randomized, multicentre,\nnon-inferiority Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of a\nmaintenance 4D/week therapy (4/7 days) versus daily intake (7/7 days) in\nthose who are virally suppressed for 48 weeks. The study was approved by\nthe French Sud-Ouest OM III ethics committee. The study was registered\nin ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03256422) and EudraCT (2017-000040-17).\n\nAt W48, all participants on standard continuous triple therapy with\nvirological suppression had their treatment switched to the intermittent\nstrategy, and all participants were followed for an additional 48 weeks,\nuntil W96. Adults with plasma VL \\<50 copies/mL for \\>12 months and no\nresistance mutations to current ART (cART) were randomly assigned (1:1),\nwith stratification by third agent class. Total blood samples for HIV\nDNA VL measurements and semen samples for seminal plasma VL evaluations\nwere collected at D0 and W48 for the first 121 participants who agreed\nto participate in these virological substudies ( *n* = 54 in 4/7 arm and\n*n* = 67 in 7/7 arm) (Table S1 , available as Supplementary data at\n*JAC* Online). Blood plasma samples for ultra-sensitive plasma VL\n(USpVL) were collected at D0, W4, W12, W24, W36 and W48. Samples were\ncollected at all visits and at the end of the 3D-off-treatment period\nbefore participants reinitiated ART, except at W12 and W36, at which\ntime samples were collected on the third or fourth day of treatment.\nParticipants were screened from 7 September 2017 to 22 January 2018, and\nthe W48 analysis included data collected up to 4 April 2019.\n\n### Virological analyses\n\nAt D0 and W48, HIV total DNA was measured using the real-time PCR kit\nGENERIC HIVDNA Cell ^®^ (Biocentric ^®^ , Bandol, France), with a limit\nof quantification (LOQ) of 10 copies/PCR, as previously described.\n^\\ \\ 21^ USpVL was determined at D0 and W48 using the COBAS ^®^ HIV-1\nassay, v2.0 (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ, USA). This assay\nprovides quantitative results for HIV RNA values ≥20 copies/mL. For\nmeasurements of plasma HIV-1 RNA \\<20 copies/mL, qualitative readings of\nVL were denoted as target detected (TD), corresponding to residual\nviraemia, and measurements not qualitatively observable as target not\ndetected (TND). The measure of USpVL was centralized in Saint Antoine\nHospital when a centre did not use Roche technology.\n\nSemen samples were collected after at least 3 days of sexual abstinence\nusing Clinisperm (Labelians) by self-masturbation at home within 4 h\nbefore the visit. HIV RNA was quantified in seminal plasma at D0, W24\nand W48 using the COBAS ^®^ HIV-1 assay, v2.0 (Roche Molecular Systems),\nwith an LOQ of 100 copies/mL because of 1/5 dilution. ^\\ \\ 22^\n\nResistance was retrospectively evaluated for participants with VF (pVL\n\\>50 copies/mL, confirmed within 4 weeks), numbering six and four in the\n4/7 and 7/7 days groups, respectively, at failure in RNA samples (on the\nconfirmed test), and at D0 in DNA samples. Sanger and ultra-deep\nsequencing (UDS) were performed for the reverse transcriptase (RT),\nprotease (PR) and integrase (INT) regions, according to the Agence\nNationale de Recherche sur le SIDA et les Maladies Infectieuses\nEmergentes (ANRS-MIE) consensus, using Illumina technology (Illumina,\nSan Diego, CA, USA). The sequence reads were analysed using IDNSVR\nsoftware v3_8_0r4 (VCSmartGene), and resistance was interpreted using\nthe latest ANRS resistance algorithm (version 24,\nhttp://hivfrenchresistance.org/ ). We also analysed sequences with the\nStanford algorithm ( https://hivdb.stanford.edu/ ). For UDS, the minimum\ncoverage was set to 50 and the ambiguity filter to 2%. According to the\nsignature APOBEC-mediated mutations list of Stanford University (\nhttps://hivdb.stanford.edu/page/apobecs/ ), five G-to-A drug resistance\nmutations (DRMs) in the RT gene were considered in the HIV-1 sequences:\nD67N, E138K, M184I, G190E/S and M230I; and six in the integrase gene:\nG118R, E138K, G140R/S, G163K/R, D232N and R263K.\n\n### Pharmacological analyses\n\nPlasma ARV residual concentrations for the 'ON period,' collected at D0,\nW12 and W36, and 'OFF period,' collected at W4, W24 and W48, of the 4/7\nstrategy ^\\ \\ 17^ were measured using a validated turbulent flow\nchromatography method \\[TurboFlow ^®^ online extraction system and a CTC\n^®^ auto sampler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Les Ulis, France)\\] coupled\nwith triple quadrupole MS detection, with an electrospray ionization\ninterface, derived from a previously described method. ^\\ \\ 23^\n\n### Statistical analyses\n\nThe demographic and HIV infection characteristics are presented using\nmedians and IQRs for continuous variables and numbers with percentages\nfor categorical variables. Comparisons between groups were tested using\nFisher's exact test or Pearson's chi-squared test for categorical\nvariables and the Mann--Whitney *U* -test for continuous variables. We\nestimated the proportion of participants with USpVL detectable (detected\nsignal) over time. The 95% CI for binomial distribution was constructed\nusing the exact Clopper--Pearson method. A generalized estimating\nequation was used to compare the changes from D0 in blood plasma\nresidual viraemia within and between the two groups at W48.\n\nWe estimated the unadjusted and adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95%\nCIs for potential risk factors of USpVL detectable over time using a\ngeneralized estimating equation with a Poisson distribution, log\nfunction and unstructured covariance matrix. In addition to the\ntreatment group and the stratification factor (third agent class),\nvariables with univariate *P* values \\<0.20 were retained for\nmultivariable analysis.\n\nWe also estimated the probability of occurrence of USpVL detectable up\nto W48 among participants with USpVL undetectable at D0 using the\nKaplan--Meier method. The associated 95% CIs were constructed using the\nPrentice--Kalbfleisch method. A log rank test was used to compare the\nincidence rates between the two treatment groups. The change from D0 to\nW48 in total cell HIV DNA was compared between the two treatment groups\nusing the Mann--Whitney test. Total cell HIV DNA values below the LOQ\nwere replaced by the LOQ. Unadjusted and adjusted RRs and 95% CIs of\nchanges in detectable HIV DNA (\\>LOQ) from D0 to W48 were calculated\nusing a generalized estimating equation.\n\nThe change in the percentage of participants with detectable plasma HIV\nseminal VL (≥100 copies/mL) from D0 to W48 was compared between the two\ntreatment groups using a generalized estimating equation.\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Characteristics of the substudy population\n\nThe baseline characteristics of the participants enrolled in the\nsubstudy are shown in Table 1 . The characteristics of the substudy\npopulation were similar to those of the population not included in the\nsubstudy (Table 1 ). The two treatment groups of the substudies were\nalso very similar at D0. Most of the participants were men (84.3%), 69%\nwere MSM, the median (IQR) age was 49 years (40--53) and 10% were from\nsub-Saharan Africa. The median (IQR) duration of suppressed HIV RNA\n(\\<50 copies/mL) at D0 was 5.3 years (3.6--8.5). The median CD4 nadir\nand baseline CD4 counts were 324 and 669 cells/mm ^3^ , respectively,\nthe baseline CD4/CD8 ratio was 1.1, and the pre-ART VL was 4.8 log ~10~\ncopies/mL. The cART regimens were based on INSTIs for 47.1%, NNRTIs for\n47.1% and PIs for 5.8% of participants. The baseline NRTI backbone\nconsisted of tenofovir/emtricitabine or tenofovir\nalafenamide/emtricitabine for 76.0% of participants and\nabacavir/lamivudine for 24.0%.\n\n### Reservoir analyses\n\n#### Longitudinal change of USpVL during the first 48 weeks\n\nThe USpVL was not found to change significantly over time, with a\nproportion of participants with a detectable USpVL at D0 and W48 of\n16.7% (9/54) and 25.0% (13/52) in the 4/7 days group and 22.4% (15/67)\nand 29.7% (19/64) in the 7/7 days group, respectively \\[+8.3% versus\n+7.3%, *P* = 0.971 and adjusted RR (aRR) of 0.9 (95% CI 0.4--2.0), *P*\n= 0.813\\] (Figure 1a and Table 2 ). The probability of finding a\ndetectable USpVL during the first 48 weeks among participants with an\nundetectable D0 USpVL was similar between the two groups ( *P* = 0.926)\n(Figure 1b ). Univariate and multivariate analysis of factors associated\nwith the change in the proportion of USpVL \\>1 copy/mL from D0 to W48\nshowed that participants with a pre-ART HIV VL \\>500 000 copies/mL had a\nhigher risk of having a USpVL \\>1 copy/mL at W48, with an aRR of 6.6\n(95% CI 1.0 to 44.8) relative to those whose pre-ART HIV VL was\n\\<100 000 copies/mL (Table 2 ). Interestingly, there was no association\nwith the group or ART regimen. We observed no significant association\nbetween the rate of detectable baseline HIV DNA and the occurrence of\nresidual viraemia.\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\\(a\\) Longitudinal changes of the proportion of detectable USpVL until\nW48 ( *N* = 121).

The\nproportion of detectable DNA (\\>40 copies/10 ^6^ cells) at D0 and W48\nwas 53.7% (29/54) and 57.4% (31/54) in the 4/7 days group and 56.1%\n(37/66) and 51.8% (34/66) in the 7/7 days group, respectively (+3.7%\nversus −4.3%, *P* = 0.358). There was no significant difference in the\nmedian HIV DNA levels between the two groups and no significant change\nof the HIV DNA level between D0 and W48 in either group (Figure 2 ).\nThere was no significant difference in change of detectable HIV DNA\nlevels at D0 and W48 between the 4/7 days group with median (IQR) 227\n(108--345) and 296 (108--382), respectively, and the 7/7 days group with\nmedian (IQR) 172 (88--365) and 167 (71--344), respectively \\[+41 (−2 to\n+122) versus +2 (−66 to +76), *P* = 0.087\\].\n\nFigure 2.\n\nLongitudinal changes of HIV DNA rate in the two groups until W48. This\nfigure appears in colour in the online version of *JAC* and in black and\nwhite in the print version of *JAC* .\n\nOpen in new tab Download slide\n\nUnivariate and multivariate analysis of factors associated with changes\nin the rate of undetectable HIV DNA (\\<40 copies/10 ^6^ cells) from D0\nto W48 confirmed that the effect of the study treatment strategy did not\ndiffer between the groups in terms of the change in this parameter from\nD0 to W48 (Table 3 ).\n\n#### Longitudinal changes of the percentage of a detectable HIV seminal VL during the first 48 weeks\n\nSemen HIV RNA was measured for 78 participants, with the proportion of\ndetectable semen VL being 2.2% (1/45) at D0 and 4.5% (2/45) at W48 in\nthe 4/7 days group versus 6.1% (2/33) and 9.1% (3/33) in the 7/7 days\ngroup, respectively (+2.3% versus +3.0%, *P* = 0.743), with no\nsignificant evolution between D0 and W48 within either group. All\nparticipants with a detectable semen VL (three participants at D0 and\nsix at W48) harboured plasma HIV VL \\<50 copies/mL, without a difference\nin detectable USpVL (2/3 at D0 and 5/6 at W48) (Table S2 ).\n\n### UDS resistance analyses of HIV DNA and RNA at initiation and failure\n\nAll 10 VFs are presented in Table 4 . At D0, no DRMs were detected in\nthe HIV DNA by Sanger sequencing. However, by UDS, 2/6 participants with\nVF in the 4/7 days group harboured a DRM, one T215S involved in\nresistance to tenofovir/tenofovir alafenamide and one Y188L associated\nwith resistance to rilpivirine. Moreover, three participants presented\nviruses with APOBEC mutations. At failure, 3/6 participants with VF in\nthe 4/7 days group showed resistance to at least one drug of their\ncurrent treatment by RNA Sanger sequencing (two participants with\ntenofovir/emtricitabine and rilpivirine DRMs and one with\nabacavir/lamivudine and raltegravir DRMs) as previously described.\n^\\ \\ 17^ UDS revealed two additional participants with resistant\nvariants (one participant harbouring DRMs to tenofovir\nalafenamide/emtricitabine and elvitegravir/cobicistat and one harbouring\na DRM to tenofovir alafenamide). At failure in the 7/7 days group, 1/4\nparticipants with VF had a virus resistant to rilpivirine (K101E) by\nSanger sequencing, and UDS revealed three additional participants with\nresistant variants to at least one drug of their current treatment: one\nwith DRMs to tenofovir/emtricitabine and rilpivirine, one with a DRM to\nrilpivirine, and one with a DRM to once-daily dolutegravir.\n\nTwo participants showed non-efficient plasma concentrations. One, with a\ntenofovir alafenamide concentration of 7 ng/mL (N = 7--14 ng/mL) and an\nelvitegravir concentration of 11 ng/mL (N = 190--710 ng/mL), was in the\n4/7 days group during the 'ON period.' The other was in the 7/7 days\ngroup, with a tenofovir concentration of 6 ng/mL and rilpivirine\nconcentration of 4 ng/mL (N \\> 50 ng/mL). These two participants showed\nresistance at failure and detectable DRMs only by UDS.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nARV strategies with fewer drug regimens as maintenance therapy for\nparticipants who achieve virological suppression are increasingly being\nused. This change has been triggered by the desire to improve tolerance\nto new regimens and to increase the adherence and durability of\ntreatments. Several recent clinical trials with short-cycle ART\n^\\ \\ 12\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 16\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 24^ or two-drug regimens\n^\\ \\ 8\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 9\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 25^ have shown that such strategies could be\neffective and safe.\n\nThe impact of such reduced ART strategies on the blood reservoir is\nstill an important question. Indeed, an increase in reservoir size could\nresult from treatment simplification, since drug penetration for many\ncommonly used ARV drugs is lower in lymphoid tissue cells than in blood\ncells. ^\\ \\ 26^ Such undesirable growth of the viral reservoir could\nlater hamper or complicate treatment.\n\nIn virological substudies of the ANRS 170 QUATUOR trial, which are\nrepresentative of the total trial population, we measured the viral\nreservoir as total HIV DNA, as well as residual plasma viraemia and\nsemen VL as surrogate markers of the size of the HIV infection\nreservoir, which could influence long-term suppression.\n^\\ \\ 21\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 27\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 28^ There was no significant difference after\n1 year of a 4/7 days maintenance strategy versus a 7/7 days regimen in\nterms of blood HIV DNA level (as previously described ^\\ \\ 17^ ) or the\npercentage of participants with residual plasma viraemia. In a substudy\non the seminal compartment based on 78 participants, we showed that\nseminal plasma HIV was detectable in \\<10% of participants at D0 and W48\nand in non-significantly different proportions in the two groups.\n\nThe blood HIV DNA level was highly stable during the follow-up, showing\nno impact of 4/7 days maintenance therapy on the size of the cellular\nreservoir. Our findings are in accordance with those of the ANRS 162-4D\ntrial, which evaluated a pilot 4D/week strategy. ^\\ \\ 16^ Another\nproof-of-concept study with a 3D/week efavirenz/tenofovir disoproxil\nfumarate/emtricitabine regimen showed no significant change in the size\nof the HIV reservoir over 24 weeks. ^\\ \\ 24^ We observed a great\nproportion of participants harbouring HIV DNA \\< LOQ (44%) in our study,\nbut our participants had a long duration of ART (median 6.6 years) and a\nlong duration of suppressed HIV viraemia (median 5.3 years). Similar\nfindings have been reported for other maintenance strategies, which\nevaluated dolutegravir plus lamivudine maintenance dual therapy.\n^\\ \\ 29\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 30^ Such stability of the HIV cellular reservoir is\nconsistent with the results of previous studies, which showed similar\nstability of HIV DNA in chronically ART-controlled people living with\nHIV, even after very prolonged virological suppression, ^\\ \\ 21^\nalthough a greater change in residual viraemia has also been observed.\n^\\ \\ 11^\n\nWe found no significant change in the proportion of participants with\nresidual plasma viraemia during the first year, as in a study that\nassessed the efficacy of a switch to a\ntenofovir/emtricitabine/rilpivirine single-tablet regimen in\nvirologically suppressed participants on residual viraemia. ^\\ \\ 31^ In\nthe aforementioned study, 70% of participants had no residual viraemia\nat baseline before switching to the single-tablet regimen, and this\nproportion remained stable during the follow-up, with 74% of\nparticipants with no residual viraemia at W48. In another maintenance\nstrategy, USpVL quantification in a subgroup of 72 participants from the\nASPIRE trial (dolutegravir + lamivudine) also showed a non-significant\ndifference in residual viraemia at baseline and after 24 and 48 weeks\nfrom the switch. ^\\ \\ 32^ In studies of another two-drug strategy, the\nproportion of participants with detectable VL in the SWORD 1 and 2\ntrials was similar for the dolutegravir + rilpivirine and cART groups at\nall timepoints analysed. ^\\ \\ 33^ In our study, we observed a large\nproportion of participants without residual plasma viraemia at D0\n(80.2%), but our participants had a very long duration of suppressed HIV\nviraemia, with 88.2% of participants having experienced no prior VF, and\nall carried viruses susceptible to all ongoing ARV drugs based on\nprevious plasma RNA or PBMC DNA genotypes.\n\nIn seminal plasma, semen VL was detectable for 3.8% of participants at\nD0 and 6.4% at W48, with no concordance between viraemia and genital\nshedding. The frequency of genital shedding in each of these groups fell\nwithin the lower limit of the range reported for three-drug regimens in\nother studies (2%--20%). ^\\ \\ 34--39^ This finding is in accordance with\nthe reported rate of the dolutegravir/lamivudine therapy study, ^\\ \\ 29^\nwhere the proportion was 5.9% at baseline to 11.8% at W48. In another\nstudy, ^\\ \\ 35^ the frequency of genital HIV RNA shedding while\nvirologically suppressed in blood was similar (around 5%) between those\nwho were on standard three-drug ART and those who were on\ndolutegravir-lamivudine in maintenance therapy. Overall, these results\nsuggest that short-cycle therapy is effective in controlling genital HIV\nshedding. Episodic genital HIV RNA expression occurs in certain\nindividuals with suppressed viraemia, possibly due to genital viral\ncompartmentalization, with poor drug penetration, ^\\ \\ 40\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 41^ or\nthe stimulation of viral replication by sexually transmitted infections\nand genital inflammation. ^\\ \\ 38\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 42\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 43^\n\nAnother important concern about our strategy is the emergence of\nresistance in cases of VF. Resistance mutations related to current ART\nwere detected more frequently by UDS. ^\\ \\ 19\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 20^ Among the 10\nparticipants with VF, two showed resistant minority variants at D0,\nwhich could have favoured VF but without data on D0 UDS for persons\nwithout VF, the impact of baseline minority resistance-associated\nmutations cannot be fully assessed. At failure, the UDS method revealed\nan additional five participants with variants resistant to their current\ntreatment, especially for drugs with a low genetic barrier to\nresistance, such as rilpivirine and raltegravir. Two participants showed\nnon-efficient plasma concentrations, reflecting probable poor\nobservance, and showed resistance at failure and detectable DRMs only by\nUDS.\n\nUltrasensitive analyses of reservoir and minority resistant variants\nwere performed in the context of intermittent maintenance therapy. Our\nresults are in agreement with the majority of simplification dual trials\n^\\ \\ 29\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 30\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 32\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 33^ but contribute original\ninformation concerning the short-cycle ART strategy. The fact that no\nchange was observed during the first year of 4/7 days maintenance\ntherapy in residual plasma viraemia levels or the size of the HIV\ncellular reservoir compared with the 7/7 days regimen, regardless of\ndrug class, is reassuring concerning not only the potency of virological\nsuppression in terms of residual viraemia but also in terms of the\ncellular reservoir in the blood and the male genital reservoir. Emerging\nresistance at failure was more frequent in the 4/7 days group detected\nby Sanger sequencing: 3/6 participants versus 1/4 in the 7/7 days group,\n^\\ \\ 17^ and similar with the UDS assay: 5/6 versus 4/4, respectively.\nResistance mutations were selected under drugs with lower genetic\nbarrier such as rilpivirine, raltegravir or elvitegravir. Longer\nevaluation of virological reservoirs at W96 under the 4/7 days\nmaintenance strategy is warranted to consolidate these results.\n\nIn summary, these virological substudies of the QUATUOR trial confirm\nthe virological efficacy of the 4/7 days reduction strategy by showing\nno increase in residual viral replication, no change in the reservoir\nmeasured by total HIV DNA, and no viral replication in the genital\ncompartment, in long-time controlled persons receiving triple therapy\nwith few prior VF and no resistance mutations to current ART; these\nresults will be interesting to confirm in the wider population. In order\nto prevent the selection of related resistance mutations in the event of\nVF, it may be more prudent to use high genetic barrier molecules in this\nstrategy.\n\n\n## Funding\n\nThe trial was sponsored and funded by the ANRS \\| Emerging Infectious\nDiseases.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 32027734\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Molecular dating and viral load growth rates suggested that the eclipse phase lasted about a week in HIV-1 infected adults in East Africa and Thailand\nAbstract\nMost HIV-1 infected individuals do not know their infection dates. Precise infection timing is crucial information for studies that document transmission networks or drug levels at infection. To improve infection timing, we used the prospective RV217 cohort where the window when plasma viremia becomes detectable is narrow: the last negative visit occurred a median of four days before the first detectable HIV-1 viremia with an RNA test, referred below as diagnosis. We sequenced 1,280 HIV-1 genomes from 39 participants at a median of 4, 32 and 170 days post-diagnosis. HIV-1 infections were dated by using sequence-based methods and a viral load regression method. Bayesian coalescent and viral load regression estimated that infections occurred a median of 6 days prior to diagnosis (IQR: 9--3 and 11--4 days prior, respectively). Poisson-Fitter, which analyzes the distribution of hamming distances among sequences, estimated a median of 7 days prior to diagnosis (IQR: 15--4 days) based on sequences sampled 4 days post-diagnosis, but it did not yield plausible results using sequences sampled at 32 days. Fourteen participants reported a high-risk exposure event at a median of 8 days prior to diagnosis (IQR: 12 to 6 days prior).

Women were enrolled at 22 clinical research sites in nine countries (Botswana, Brazil, India, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, USA, and Zimbabwe). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three oral regimens: dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate; dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; or efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Up to 14 days of the antepartum ART before enrolment was permitted. Women with known multiple gestation, fetal anomalies, acute significant illness, creatinine more than 2·5 times the upper limit of normal, or estimated creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL/min were excluded. Primary safety analyses were pairwise comparisons between ART regimens of the proportion of maternal and infant adverse events of grade 3 or higher up to 50 weeks post partum. Secondary efficacy analyses at 50 weeks post partum included comparison of the proportion of women with plasma HIV-1 RNA of less than 200 copies per mL in the combined dolutegravir-containing groups versus the efavirenz-containing group. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned participants with available data.

The aim of this study\nwas to investigate the patterns and temporal trends in HIV DR as well as\nthe prevalence of genetic variants in treatment-naïve patients from 2006\nto 2022, using data from the Russian database (4481 protease and reverse\ntranscriptase and 844 integrase gene sequences). HIV genetic variants,\nand DR and DR mutations (DRMs) were determined using the Stanford\nDatabase. The analysis showed high viral diversity, with the\npredominance of A6 (78.4%), which was the most common in all\ntransmission risk groups. The overall prevalence of surveillance DRMs\n(SDRMs) was 5.4%, and it reached 10.0% in 2022. Most patients harbored\nNNRTI SDRMs (3.3%). The prevalence of SDRMs was highest in the Ural\n(7.9%). Male gender and the CRF63_02A6 variant were association factors\nwith SDRMs. The overall prevalence of DR was 12.7% and increased over\ntime, primarily due to NNRTIs. Because baseline HIV genotyping is\nunavailable in Russia, it is necessary to conduct surveillance of HIV DR\ndue to the increased ART coverage and DR prevalence. Centralized\ncollection and unified analysis of all received genotypes in the\nnational database can help in understanding the patterns and trends in\nDR to improve treatment protocols and increase the effectiveness of ART.\nMoreover, using the national database can help identify regions or\ntransmission risk groups with a high prevalence of HIV DR for\nepidemiological measures to prevent the spread of HIV DR in the country.\n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1. Study Population and Data Collection\n\nWe analyzed sequences and linked demographic, clinical, and\nepidemiological data uploaded to the RuHIV database ( https://ruhiv.ru/\n, accessed on 1 December 2022) from 4481 treatment-naïve HIV-infected\npatients. The sequences covered the HIV-1 protease (PR), and part of the\nreverse transcriptase (RT) was available for all patients; additionally,\nsequences covering the HIV-1 integrase (INT) were available for 844 of\nthem.\n\nThe sequences from the RuHIV database were obtained as a part of routine\nHIV DR testing, research and clinical projects, and outbreak\ninvestigations from 2006 to 2022 in ten laboratories in different\nregions in Russia.\n\nIn order to avoid distortion of the results, in the case of multiple\navailable sequences for one patient, the nucleotide sequences from the\nearliest blood sampling were used.\n\n### 2.2. RNA Extraction and HIV-1 Sequencing\n\nCommercial genotyping kits (the AmpliSens ^®®^ HIV-Resist-Seq kit\n(Central Research Institute of Epidemiology, Russia), the ViroSeq™ HIV-1\nGenotyping System kit (Celera Diagnostics, Alameda, CA, USA)), and\nin-house methods were used for RNA extraction from the blood plasma\nsamples and Sanger-based or NGS-based (with 20% detection threshold)\nsequencing of the HIV pol gene regions encoding the PR-RT (2253--3369 bp\naccording to the HXB-2 strain, GenBank accession number K03455 ), and\nthe INT (4230--5093 bp according to HXB-2, GenBank accession number\nK03455 ).\n\n### 2.3. Sequence Quality Control\n\nQuality assurance of HIV-1 sequences was carried out using the WHO BCCfE\nHIVDR QC tool ( http://pssm.cfenet.ubc.ca/who_qc/ , accessed on 1\nDecember 2022) and quality control tool of Calibrated Population\nResistance (CPR) ( https://hivdb.stanford.edu/cpr/ , accessed on 1\nDecember 2022) before data analysis. The sequences, identified as\nfailing in at least one tool, were excluded from the analysis. All\nsequence pairs with a genetic distance \\<0.5% within the same sequencing\nbatch were excluded.\n\n### 2.4. HIV-1 Subtyping\n\nHIV-1 genetic variants were determined using PR-RT sequences by the\nStanford HIV Drug Resistance Database ( https://hivdb.stanford.edu/ ,\naccessed on 10 December 2022) and subsequently clarified by the HIV\nBLAST tool (\nhttps://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/BASIC_BLAST/basic_blast.html ,\naccessed on 10 December 2022).\n\n### 2.5. HIV-1 Drug Resistance Interpretation\n\nThe Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (HIVdb Program v 9.4 and\nCalibrated Population Resistance Tool) was used to describe and\ninterpret the HIV DR level and DRMs, including SDRMs \\[ 17 \\].\n\nThe DR level was classified according to the Stanford Penalty Score as\nhigh (60), intermediate (30--59), or low (15--29) to:\n\n-\nnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs): abacavir (ABC),\nzidovudine (AZT), emtricitabine (FTC), lamivudine (3TC), tenofovir\n(TDF), stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI);\n\n-\nnon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): doravirine\n(DOR), efavirenz (EFV), etravirine (ETR), nevirapine (NVP),\nrilpivirine (RPV);\n\n-\nprotease inhibitors (PIs): atazanavir (ATV), darunavir (DRV),\nlopinavir (LPV), fosamprenavir (FPV), indinavir (IDV), nelfinavir\n(NFV), saquinavir (SQV), tipranavir (TPV);\n\n-\nintegrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs): bictegravir (BIC),\ncabotegravir (CAB), dolutegravir (DTG), elvitegravir (EVG),\nraltegravir (RAL).\n\nSequences with DR were defined as sequences with a Stanford Penalty\nScore of 15 or higher.\n\n### 2.6. Statistical Analysis\n\nEstimates of the prevalence of DR and DRMs were calculated with 95%\nconfidence intervals (CIs). Fischer's exact test was used for the\nanalysis of differences between proportions. A two-tailed *p* -value \\<\n0.05 was considered significant. All analyses were performed using STATA\n(v 15).\n\n### 2.7. Ethics\n\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the Central\nResearch Institute of Epidemiology (Moscow, Russia).\n\nThe informed written consent of each HIV-infected patient or the\npatient's legal guardian was obtained prior to the sampling and\ncollection of clinical, demographic, and epidemiological data. All the\ndata were anonymized and coded at a national level before being uploaded\nto the RuHIV database.\n\n\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. Characteristics of the Study Population\n\nWe studied the genotype results of 4481 HIV-1-infected treatment-naïve\npatients from all Russian FDs. Most of the study patients were from the\nCentral FD (1661; 37.1%), followed by Southern (666; 14.9%), and Volga\n(617; 13.8%) FDs ( Table 1 ). The smallest number of patients with\navailable genotypes was from the North Caucasian FD (18; 0.4%).\n\nOf the 4481 study patients, the majority were male (2510; 56.0%) and\nreported heterosexual contact as the main risk factor (1951; 43.5%),\nfollowed by IDU (967; 21.6%).\n\nThe median age of the patients was 33 years (range 27--39). The study\npopulation included 20 (0.4%) HIV-infected individuals aged \\<18 years.\n\nAll patients had detectable VL at genotyping test. The median plasma\nHIV-1 RNA was 4.6 log10 copies/mL (range 4.0--5.2), and the median CD4+\nT-cell count was 401 cells/mm ^3^ (range 264--559.5).\n\nThe years of diagnosis based on first HIV-positive immune blotting\nranged between 1997 and 2022, and blood sampling years ranged between\n2006 and 2022.\n\n### 3.2. Prevalence of HIV-1 Genetic Variants\n\nThe vast majority of the study PR-RT sequences (n = 4481) were\nclassified as sub-subtype A6 (3514; 78.4%). The circulating recombinant\nform (CRF) 63_02A6 (414; 9.2%), B (295; 6.6%), CRF03_A6B (73; 1.6%),\nCRF02_AG (70; 1.6%), and G (58; 1.3%) were also detected at low\nprevalence. In addition, 57 (1.3%) sequences were found to belong to\nother genetic variants, including CRF01_AE, A1, 19_cpx, 14_BG,\nCRF01_AE/B, CRF20_BG, 56_cpx, C, 11_cpx, CRF06_cpx, and F1, each with a\nprevalence of less than 1%.\n\nWe analyzed the prevalence of HIV-1 genetic variants in patients living\nin different FDs ( Figure 1 ), across time ( Figure S1 ) and belonging\nto different transmission risk groups ( Table 2 ).\n\nFigure 1\n\nPrevalence of HIV-1 genetic variants in the FDs of Russia. \\* Others\n(other HIV-1 genetic variants) include CRF01_AE, A1, 19_cpx, 14_BG,\nCRF01_AE/B, CRF20_BG, 56_cpx, C, 11_cpx, CRF06_cpx, and F1.\nAbbreviation: CRF, circulating recombinant form.\n\n\nSub-subtype A6 was the most common genetic variant circulating among\nresidents of all FDs. The exception was the study patients from the\nNorth Caucasian FD, who were mainly infected with CRF63_02A6, which does\nnot reflect the actual situation due to the small sample size (n = 18).\nIn the Siberian FD, there was also a high prevalence of CRF63_02A6\n(36.0%). In the Ural and Northwestern FDs, the prevalence of CRF03_A6B\nwas 6.7% and 10.8%, respectively, which is higher than in other\ndistricts (0--1.6%) ( *p* \\< 0.0001). The highest genetic diversity was\nobserved in the Central, Northwestern, and Southern FDs.\n\nDue to the small sample size in some years of blood sampling, we\ncombined data to analyze temporal trends of HIV genetic variants. The\ntemporal trends of sub-subtype A6 have decreased, whereas CRF63_02A6,\nCRF02_AG and other genetic variants (CRF01_AE, A1, 19_cpx, 14_BG,\nCRF01_AE/B, CRF20_BG, 56_cpx, C, 11_cpx, CRF06_cpx, F1) have been on an\nincreasing trend since 2012 ( Figure S1 ). The proportion of subtype B\nhas not changed since 2009. The proportion of CRF03_A6B and subtype G\ndid not change throughout the study period.\n\nSub-subtype A6 was the most common genetic variant among patients\nbelonging to all transmission risk groups. In addition to sub-subtype\nA6, subtype B was also noted among men with sexual transmission without\nclarification (A6: 71.8%; B: 15.3%). Among men having sex with men\n(MSM), a high frequency of subtype B was also found (A6: 51.0%; B:\n33.7%), and among IDUs: CRF63_02A6 (A6: 81.6%; CRF63_02A6: 12.5%).\n\n### 3.3. Prevalence of Major DRMs and SDRMs\n\nWe studied the prevalence of all major DRMs and SDRMs using PR-RT (n =\n4481) and INT (n = 844) sequences for NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs, and INSTIs,\nrespectively.\n\nThe overall prevalence of SDRMs in treatment-naïve patients with the\n2006--2022 sampling years was 5.4% (95% CI, 4.7--6.1%). Most of these\npatients harbored SDRMs to NNRTIs (3.3% (95% CI, 2.8--3.8%)), followed\nby NRTIs (1.4% (95% CI, 1.0--1.7%)), PIs (1.4% (95% CI, 1.0--1.7%)), and\nINSTIs (0.1% (95% CI, 0.0--0.7%)).\n\nThe most frequent NNRTI SDRMs were K103N/S (100/4481; 2.2%) and G190A/S\n(27/4481; 0.6%), which cause high-level resistance to both EFV and NVP,\nand K101E (17/4481; 0.4%), which confers resistance to all NNRTIs. For\nNRTIs, M184V/I (30/4481; 0.7%) and T215D/Y/S/I/E (15/4481; 0.3%) were\nthe most commonly observed SDRMs. M184V/I was associated with DR to 3TC,\nFTC, and ABC. T215Y confers a high level of DR to AZT, and other\nrevertant mutations in this position do not reduce NRTI susceptibility\nbut arise from viruses that contain T215Y/F. Of the PI SDRMs, M46I/L\n(28/4481; 0.6%) and I85V (14/4481; 0.3%) were the most frequently found,\nwhich individually have minimal effects on PI susceptibility. For\nINSTIs, only one SDRM was found, R263K (1/844; 0.1%), which reduced the\nsusceptibility of the virus to all drugs of this class \\[ 24 \\].\n\nThe most common DRM was A62V (1787/4481; 39.9%), which is non-SDRM and\nwell-known as polymorphic in sub-subtype A6 and, alone, probably confers\nlittle to no NRTI resistance. The most prevalent NNRTI-associated DRM\nincluded E138A (239/4481; 5.3%), which is also polymorphic in\nsub-subtype A6 and associated with reduced susceptibility to RPV. Other\ncommonly observed NNRTI DRMs included V179D/E/T (70/4481; 1.6%) and\nV106I (57/4481; 1.3%), which are associated with minimal reduction in\nNNRTI susceptibility \\[ 24 \\].\n\nThe prevalence of all DRMs, including SDRMs, is shown in Table S1 .\n\nThe yearly prevalence of SDRMs varied from 2006 to 2022 but generally\nincreased over time ( Figure 2 ). The highest prevalence of SDRMs was\ndetermined in patients in the 2021 and 2022 sampling years: 10.2% (95%\nCI, 6.6--15.1%) and 10.0% (95% CI, 5.2--17.5%), respectively.\n\nFigure 2\n\nTemporal trends in SDRMs in Russia in the 2006--2022 sampling years. The\nrange of the 95% confidence interval is represented as a blue cloud\naround a line. Abbreviation: SDRMs, surveillance drug resistance\nmutations.\n\nAdditionally, we explored the association between SDRMs and the\ndemographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of patients.\nStatistical analysis revealed that SDRMs were observed significantly\nmore often in male patients than female patients (6.1% vs. 4.5%, *p* =\n0.0181) and patients infected with CRF63_02A6 compared to other variants\n(11.4% vs. 5.0%, *p* \\< 0.0001), whereas patients infected with\nsub-subtype A6 are less likely to have SDRMs than those infected with\nother variants (4.7% vs. 8.8%, *p* \\< 0.0001). There were no significant\nassociations between the SDRMs in study patients and the median age,\ntransmission risk group, VL, and CD4+ T-cell count.\n\nHowever, significant differences were found in the prevalence of DR\nacross FDs ( Figure 3 ). The prevalence of SDRMs was significantly\nhigher in the North Caucasian (33.3% (95% CI, 6.1--56.4%)) ( *p* =\n0.0003) and Ural (7.9% (95% CI, 5.7--10.8%)) ( *p* = 0.0376) FDs.\nConversely, the prevalence of SDRMs was significantly lower in the Volga\nFD (3.2% (95% CI, 2.1--5.0%)) ( *p* = 0.0247).\n\nFigure 3\n\nPrevalence of SDRMs in FDs of Russia in the 2006--2022 sampling years.\nThe range of the 95% confidence interval is enclosed in square brackets.\n\nIt is important to clarify that the extremely high prevalence of SDRMs\nin the North Caucasian FD was related to both a small sample (n = 18)\nand bias. For six patients from this FD, sequences were obtained during\nthe investigation of a nosocomial outbreak; all of them had identical\nviruses with K103S SDRM.\n\n### 3.4. Prevalence of DR\n\nWe studied the prevalence of DR to all ART drugs using PR-RT (n = 4481)\nand INT (n = 844) sequences for NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs, and INSTIs,\nrespectively.\n\nThe overall prevalence of DR to any drug classes in the 2006--2022\nsampling years was 12.7% (95% CI, 11.6--13.7%). Considering individual\ndrug classes, the prevalence of DR was 10.0% (95% CI, 9.1--10.9%) to any\nNNRTIs, 1.4% (95% CI, 1.1--1.8%) to any NRTIs, 2.1% (95% CI, 1.7--2.5%)\nto any PIs, and 0.6% (95% CI, 0.2--1.4%) to any INSTIs ( Figure 4 a).\n\nFigure 4\n\nHIV DR prevalence in Russia in the 2006--2022 sampling years by ( **a**\n) drug class and ( **b** ) antiretroviral drugs with DR levels. PR-RT (n\n= 4481) and INT (n = 844) sequences were used to analyze DR to NRTIs,\nNNRTIs, PIs, and INSTIs, respectively.

Notably, the DR to NVP/EFV in all FDs,\nexcept for the North Caucasian FD due to sampling bias, did not exceed\n10% and was the highest in the Ural FD (5.6% to NVP, 4.9% to EFV) (\nTable S2 ).\n\nLess than 1% of the viruses were resistant to any of the PIs with the\nexception of NFV, to which DR was found in 1.8% of treatment-naïve\npatients. The prevalence of DR to NRTIs and INSTIs did not exceed 1% for\neach drug individually ( Figure 4 b).\n\nDR presented an overall increasing trend between the 2006 and 2022\nsampling years, which was driven primarily by NNRTI resistance ( Figure\n5 ). The DR to PIs, NRTIs, and INSTIs showed no trends and was low\nacross all years, never exceeding 4%.\n\nFigure 5\n\nTemporal trends in HIV DR in Russia in the 2006--2022 sampling years by\ndrug class.

Discussion\n\nThe HIV epidemic in Russia continues to pose a threat to public health.\nWide use of ART has substantially reduced HIV-related morbidity,\nmortality, and HIV transmission \\[ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 \\]. The number of PLWHs\nreceiving ART in Russia has been constantly growing since the ART\nnational program started in 2006, and in 2021, it reached 58% \\[ 10 \\].\nHowever, the ART coverage is far from achieving the levels needed to\ncontrol the HIV epidemic and remains unsatisfactory due to the large\nnumber of newly diagnosed cases \\[ 25 \\]. Therefore, it is expected that\nART coverage among those who are HIV-positive will significantly\nincrease.\n\nUnfortunately, the expanding ART coverage, especially in the absence of\nroutine HIV DR testing, can lead to an increase in the HIV DR prevalence\n\\[ 26 , 27 \\]. The presence of HIV DR is associated with poorer\nvirological outcomes on first-line ART \\[ 28 , 29 \\], which could\ncontribute to the further emergence of DR and increasing mortality, HIV\nmorbidity, and the cost of epidemic control programs \\[ 26 , 30 , 31 ,\n32 \\]. Therefore, knowledge of HIV DR patterns and trends is critical to\neffectively treating patients at both individual and national levels.\n\nFurthermore, in Russia, there is a problem of the coverage of PLWH with\nHIV VL and DR tests that can lead to an increase in HIV DR and\njeopardize ART success. In addition to limited access to laboratory\nmonitoring of the treatment efficacy, there are some other prerequisites\nfor the emergence of HIV DR, such as high HIV prevalence, poor adherence\nto ART, and the use of NNRTI-based regimens with a low genetic barrier.\n\nWhereas baseline HIV genotyping is not available in Russia, as well as\nHIV DR surveillance studies at the country level, centralized collection\nand analysis of all received HIV nucleotide sequences can help\nunderstand the patterns and trends in DR.\n\nIn the current study, we investigated the patterns and temporal trends\nin HIV-1 DR as well as the prevalence of genetic variants in\ntreatment-naïve patients since the scaling up of ART in Russia started\nin 2006 using data from the Russian national database (\nhttps://ruhiv.ru/ , accessed on 1 December 2022). To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the largest HIV DR study in Russia, including 4481\ntreatment-naïve patients (4481 PR-RT and 844 INT sequences), covering\nthe longest period (17 years). The number of analyzed sequences exceeds\nthe number of available genotypes from Russian treatment-naïve patients\nin The Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database (\nhttps://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index , accessed on 1 December 2022)\nand is linked with full demographic, clinical, and epidemiological data.\n\nThe present study showed that the majority of patients within the\n2006--2022 sampling years reported heterosexual contact as the main risk\nfactor (43.5%), followed by IDU (21.6%) and MSM (6.8%). This reflects\nthe main trends in the epidemic, including an increase in the proportion\nin the transmission risk group of heterosexuals and MSM, and a decrease\nin IDUs \\[ 2 \\].\n\nWhile the proportion of transmission risk groups has changed over time,\nso has the distribution of genetic variants within them. Our data\nrevealed that sub-subtype A6 (formerly FSU-A or IDU-A) (78.4%), whose\ndistribution began in the mid-1990s in Odessa, Ukraine, with an outbreak\namong IDUs \\[ 33 , 34 , 35 \\], remains the dominant HIV-1 genetic\nvariant in all parts of Russia. Although nowadays this genetic variant\nis actively spreading not only among IDUs (81.6%) but also among all\ntransmission risk groups (sexual without clarification (71.8%),\nheterosexual (84.5%), MSM (51.0%), mother-to-child (94.4%), and outbreak\n(69.6%)), this could be a consequence of intermingling between them. The\nrecent study \\[ 36 \\] has already demonstrated the high distribution of\nsub-subtype A6 among IDUs as well as heterosexuals and MSM.\n\nThe following identified genetic variant was CRF63_02A6 (9.2%), which\nhas spread in the Central Asian countries \\[ 37 \\] and the Siberian FD\n\\[ 38 \\]. According to our data, this genetic variant was also most\ncommon among patients living in the Siberian FD (36.0%) and among IDUs\n(12.5%).\n\nOne of the commonly observed genetic variants was subtype B (6.6%), with\nthe highest prevalence among MSM (33.7%). Other genetic variants were\nfound with a frequency of less than 5%.\n\nPrevious studies report that sub-subtype A6 is also the predominant or\nmain genetic variant in the former Soviet Union countries \\[ 21 , 36 \\],\nreflecting economic and cultural relationships between countries,\nwhereas subtype B dominates in European countries, and subtype A\naccounts for less than 10% \\[ 39 \\].\n\nOverall, the analysis of HIV-1 genetic variants in Russia showed a high\ngenetic diversity of the virus with multiple subtypes and CRFs,\nespecially in the Central, Northwestern, and Southern FDs. In isolated\ncases (1.3%), genetic variants atypical for Russia were found, including\nA1, 19_cpx, CRF14_BG, CRF20_BG, 56_cpx, C, 11_cpx, CRF06_cpx, and F1.\n\nIn addition, the increase in the proportion of CRF63_02A6 and CRF02_AG,\nand the decrease in the proportion of the A6 subtype in the Russian\nepidemic, previously described for Russia and the countries of the\nformer Soviet Union countries \\[ 40 , 41 \\], is shown.\n\nOur study demonstrated a moderate level of SDRM prevalence (5.4%) in\ntreatment-naïve Russian patients throughout the 2006--2022 study period,\nwhich was similar (5.3%) to that observed in the previous nationwide\nstudy during the 1998--2017 sampling years \\[ 20 \\]. However, we show a\nconstantly increasing rate of SDRMs. The prevalence of SDRMs reached\n10.2% and 10.0% in the 2021 and 2022 sampling years, respectively,\nsuggesting the need for continuous surveillance.\n\nThe highest SDRM prevalence was observed for NNRTIs (3.3%). This fact\nmay reflect the widespread use of NNRTI-containing regimens and their\nlow genetic barrier. Additionally, we found a low prevalence of SDRMs to\nNRTIs (1.4%), PIs (1.4%), and INSTIs (0.1%).\n\nOf the SDRMs, K103N/S (2.2%) was the most frequently observed. That fact\ncan be related to the wide use of EFV with low genetic barriers as a\npart of first-line ART regimens or the result of effective transmission\ndue to the high ability of variants with these mutations to persist for\nyears \\[ 42 \\]. Other SDRMs were found in less than 1% of the study\npatients.\n\nA significant proportion of patients harbored the A62V NRTI mutation\n(39.9%), which is polymorphic in sub-subtype A6, and it does not cause\nDR but contributes to its development. Another polymorphic mutation in\nsub-subtype A6 E138A (5.3%) was the most common NNRTI mutation detected\nin treatment-naïve Russian patients. In vitro data from site-directed\nmutagenesis showed that E138A causes a two-fold reduction in\nsusceptibility to RPV \\[ 43 , 44 \\]; however, this does not appear to\naffect the effectiveness of RPV-containing treatment in real practice \\[\n45 , 46 \\].\n\nThe prevalence of SDRMs was uneven across Russia, with the highest in\nthe Ural FD (7.9%) and lowest in the Volga FD (3.2%). It is critical to\nstate that the high prevalence of SDRM found in the North Caucasian FD\nis a result of the small sample size (n = 18) and the bias of this\nsample, 33.3% of which consisted of patients infected with the same DR\nvirus variants during a nosocomial outbreak. Thus, future DR\nsurveillance studies in the Ural FD due to the highest rate of SDRMs, as\nwell as in the North Caucasian FD due to the small sample and bias, are\nnecessary.\n\nAdditionally, we have shown factors that are associated with an\nincreased risk of SDRMs: male gender and the CRF63_02A6 genetic variant.\n\nIn the present study, the overall prevalence of DR to any drug classes\nin the 2006--2022 sampling years was 12.7%, mainly due to NNRTI DR\n(10.0%). Furthermore, we noted a temporal trend in the spread of DR due\nto NNRTI DR. The predominance of NNRTI DR is related not only with\nwidespread and longer use of these drugs in Russia and the low genetic\nbarrier of drugs, but also with features of the A6 genetic variant.\nThus, most of the patients with NNRTI DR have DR to RPV (7.4%), mainly\ndue to polymorphic mutation E138A.\n\nMost importantly, the DR to NVP and EFV was 4.3% and 3.7%, respectively,\nand in all FDs, except for the North Caucasian FD due to sampling bias,\nit did not reach 10%, the threshold defined by the WHO at which to\nrecommend urgent public health action, including the implementation of\nan NNRTI-free first-line regimen \\[ 47 , 48 \\].\n\nWe show that the prevalence of DR to PIs and NRTIs was low,\nrespectively, 2.1% and 1.4%. The prevalence of DR to INSTIs was even\nlower, at 0.6% overall. Thus, we suggest that routine DR testing to\nINSTIs prior to treatment is currently not required in Russia.\n\nAdditionally, our analysis revealed that the prevalence of DR to\nfirst-line ART-preferred regimen drugs in Russia was low: TDF (0.3%) +\n3TC (0.7%) or FTC (0.7%) + EFV (3.7%) or DTG (0.2%). Thus, the current\nART regimen among treatment-naïve patients can be expected to be\neffective.\n\nNotably, most of the patients harbored an HIV variant with DR to only\none drug class; triple-class DR was observed in 0.02% of treatment-naïve\npatients.\n\nPrevious studies in treatment-naïve patients from the former Soviet\nUnion countries, where baseline genotyping is also not available, showed\na prevalence of pretreatment DR between 2.8% in Uzbekistan and 16.7% in\nTajikistan \\[ 21 \\]. Among European countries where a long history of\nART and high ART coverage, but at the same time, baseline genotyping is\na part of routine clinical practice, the overall prevalence of\ntransmitted DR in treatment-naïve patients ranged from 12.8% to 14.5%\nand presented a decreasing trend \\[ 39 , 49 \\].\n\nOne of the limitations presented by the study was the risk of biased\nassessments due to the dataset. The restricted number of patients from\nthe North Caucasian FD, most of whom consisted of outbreak investigation\nsequences, skewed the results for the prevalence of genetic variants and\nHIV DR. We consider that it is also important to analyze sequences\nobtained not only from routine HIV DR testing but also from clinical\ntrials or outbreak investigations; as long as these patients remain\nuntreated, they are a potential source of new infections. However,\nincreasing the sample size would help offset these problems.\n\nIt is also necessary to note the uneven distribution of the sample size\nacross years of blood sampling, with the largest coverage in 2018\n(15.2%), and the smallest in 2006 (0.2%).\n\nDespite these sampling limitations, we believe that, until obstacles to\nthe expansion of DR testing in Russia such as the large number of\nHIV-infected people and insufficient funding are overcome, the analysis\nof the national database is optimal for understanding the HIV DR\npatterns and trends.\n\nThe centralized data collection of HIV-1 sequences linked with\nepidemiological data is crucial for the development of a public health\nresponse and can be used not only to understand HIV DR but also for the\nmolecular epidemiology of HIV-1.\n\nUsing the national database, it is possible to roughly identify regions\nor transmission risk groups with a high prevalence of HIV DR and conduct\nfurther directed surveillance studies. However, it is necessary to\ncarefully approach the study sample in order to avoid bias in the\nresults.\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThis research was supported by the Central Research Institute of\nEpidemiology grant, the funding number is VG-NIR33-F (24 March 2022).\n\n## Data Availability Statement\n\nThe data presented in this study are available on request from the\ncorresponding author.

HIV Pretreatment DR (PDR) and drug resistance mutation (DRM) prevalence was estimated using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database. The PDR level was interpreted according to the WHO standard PDR survey protocols. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database and subsequently confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Transmission clusters were determined using Cluster Picker.\nResults\nAnalyses of HIV subtypes showed that EECA, in general, has the same HIV genetic variants of sub-subtype A6, CRF63_02A1, and subtype B, with different frequencies and representation for each country.\nThe prevalence of PDR to any drug class was 2.8% in Uzbekistan, 4.2% in Azerbaijan, 4.5% in Russia, 9.2% in Armenia, 13.9% in Belarus, and 16.7% in Tajikistan. PDR to protease inhibitors (PIs) was not detected in any country. PDR to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) was not detected among patients in Azerbaijan, and was relatively low in other countries, with the highest prevalence in Tajikistan (5.6%). The prevalence of PDR to nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was the lowest in Uzbekistan (2.8%) and reached 11.1% and 11.4% in Tajikistan and Belarus, respectively.\nGenetic transmission network analyses identified 226/1071 (21.1%) linked individuals, forming 93 transmission clusters mainly containing two or three sequences. We found that the time since HIV diagnosis in clustered patients was significantly shorter than that in unclustered patients (1.26 years vs 2.74 years). Additionally, the K103N/S mutation was mainly observed in clustered sequences (6.2% vs 2.8%).\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance and the genetic analysis of HIV-1 sequences from patient samples. It does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 37112921\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Transmitted HIV Drug Resistance in Bulgaria Occurs in Clusters of Individuals from Different Transmission Groups and Various Subtypes (2012--2020)\nAbstract\nTransmitted HIV drug resistance in Bulgaria was first reported in 2015 using data from 1988--2011. We determined the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity in Bulgaria during 2012--2020 using polymerase sequences from 1053 of 2010 (52.4%) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. Sequences were analyzed for DRM using the WHO HIV SDRM list implemented in the calculated population resistance tool at Stanford University. Genetic diversity was inferred using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetics. Cluster detection and characterization was performed using MicrobeTrace. The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%). Most (34/60, 56.7%) of the SDRMs were present in transmission clusters of different subtypes composed mostly of male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC), including a 14-member cluster of subtype B sequences from 12 MMSC and two males reporting heterosexual contact; 13 had the L90M PI mutation and one had the T215S NRTI SDRM. We found a low SDRM prevalence amid high HIV-1 diversity among ART-naive patients in Bulgaria during 2012--2020. The majority of SDRMs were found in transmission clusters containing MMSC, indicative of onward spread of SDRM in drug-naive individuals. Our study provides valuable information on the transmission dynamics of HIV drug resistance in the context of high genetic diversity in Bulgaria, for the development of enhanced prevention strategies to end the epidemic.\n\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity using sequences from ART-naive individuals.

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals.

Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

We employed state-of-art maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylodynamic analyses to comprehensively describe the evolutionary dynamics of the HIV-1 epidemic in Ethiopia. We used Bayesian phylodynamic models to estimate the dynamics of the effective population size (N) and reproductive numbers (Re) through time for the HIV epidemic in Ethiopia.\nResults:\nOur analysis revealed that the Ethiopian HIV-1 epidemic originated from two independent introductions at the beginning of the 1970s and 1980s from eastern and southern African countries, respectively, followed by epidemic growth reaching its maximum in the early 1990s. We identified three large clusters with a majority of Ethiopian sequences. Phylodynamic analyses revealed that all three clusters were characterized by high transmission rates during the early epidemic, followed by a decline in HIV-1 transmissions after 1990. Re was high (4–6) during the earlier time of the epidemic but dropped significantly and remained low (Re < 1) after the mid-1990s. Similarly, with an expected shift in time, the effective population size (N) steadily increased until the beginning of 2000, followed by a decline and stabilization until recent years. The phylodynamic analyses corroborated the modeled UNAIDS incidence and prevalence estimates.\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing or data.

Although there has been an increased use of\nintegrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), a very low prevalence of\nTDRAMs has been documented. ^\\ \\ 2\\ ,\\ \\ \\ 4^ Recently, a prevalence of\nINSTI TDRAMs of 0.30% was described in ART-naive patients from\nMediterranean Europe. ^\\ \\ 5^\n\nThe frequency of resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) may vary in the\nviral pool, with those that are less fit identified only at a low\nfrequency in the viral quasi-species. Sanger-based sequencing (SBS), the\nmost common method used to detect all HIV-1 resistance mutations, is\nlimited in its sensitivity, enabling the identification of mutations\nonly if present in at least 15%--20% of the viral population. Thus,\nvariants that may be present in a minor proportion of the viral\nquasi-species are missed.\n\nAs far as we are aware, we have identified the first case of\ntransmission of S230R major integrase mutation at the time of primary\ninfection, using SBS and next-generation sequencing (NGS). A 22-year-old\nman presented in April 2022 to our infectious disease department as\nseropositive for HIV after a rapid test in a sexually transmitted\ninfection clinic. A fourth-generation serological test revealed a weak\nindex reactivity (9.8; Alinity i HIV Ag/Ab combo assay; Abbott, IL, USA)\nand the HIV-1 western blot was undetermined, indicating a recent\ninfection. The last negative HIV serology was 3 months prior. Baseline\nCD4 T cell count was 577/mm ^3^ and HIV-1 viral load was 2770 copies/mL.\nThe patient was infected through homosexual contact and started on a\ndolutegravir (DTG) + emtricitabine (FTC) + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate\n(TDF) regimen 7 days after diagnosis. His sexual partner was an\nHIV-1-infected man treated but experiencing difficulties in adherence to\ntreatment. SBS of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), protease and\nintegrase was performed before treatment initiation and revealed an\nS230R INSTI mutation. There were no other drug resistance mutations in\nthe RT or protease genes. Due to the INSTI mutation, the patient was\nswitched to a regimen containing doravirine + TDF + FTC. Viral load was\n\\<50 copies/mL 6 weeks after treatment initiation and remained\nundetectable 8 months later.\n\nRetrospective baseline NGS was done using the MiSeq platform (Illumina,\nSan Diego, CA, USA) and the data were analysed with PASeq software at\ntwo cut-offs (20% and 1%). NGS allowed us to obtain a mean coverage of\n41 258 per nucleotide position for the protease region, of 17 032 for RT\nand of 16 345 for integrase. Only the S230R (99.8%) mutation was\ndetected at the threshold of 20%. At the threshold of 1%, we described\nan additional RAM, Q148R (1.9%), in the integrase gene. No RAM above the\n1% detection threshold has been detected in protease and RT regions.\n\nIn this report, we describe a primary infected patient with HIV-1\nharbouring TDRAMs \\[S230R (99%) and Q148R (1.9%)\\] affecting\nsecond-generation INSTIs, as DTG, cabotegravir (CAB) and bictegravir\n(BIC). A previous case of S230R and G163R was described using NGS in an\nART-naive pregnant woman. ^\\ \\ 6^ Mutations S230R and Q148R are present\nin the Surveillance Drug Resistance Mutation Stanford list. ^\\ \\ 7^\nS230R is a non-polymorphic INSTI-selected mutation that primarily occurs\nin combination with other INSTI-resistance mutations. The S230R mutation\nis present in 0.1% of sequences obtained from antiretroviral-naive\npatients and in 2.1% of patients treated with integrase inhibitors but\nalways in association with other mutations. ^\\ \\ 7^ Pham *et al.* ,\n^\\ \\ 8^ using an infectious molecular clone with the insertion of S230R\nby site-directed mutagenesis, showed that this mutation conferred a 63%\nreduction in integrase enzyme efficiency and a fold change in mean IC\n~50~ of 3.85, 3.72, 1.52 and 1.21 for dolutegravir, cabotegravir,\nraltegravir (RAL) and elvitegravir (EVG), respectively, compared with\nvirus lacking S230R. These results demonstrated that the S230R\nsubstitution caused similar effects on viral replicative capacity as\nR263K. ^\\ \\ 9^ This may explain the low viral load for this patient at\nthe time of seroconversion. Furthermore, a minority population of\nviruses carrying a Q148R mutation was detected in association with\nS230R. Q148R is a more common non-polymorphic mutation reported in\npersons receiving RAL, EVG, CAB and DTG. This suggests that this patient\nacquired this virus from an HIV-1-infected partner experiencing\nvirological failure with INSTI and with a transmission of a majority\nS230R variants and a minority Q148R variants. As previously described,\nHIV-1-resistant strains acquired at the time of primary infection\nmassively fuel the cellular reservoir and persist for lengthy periods of\ntime. ^\\ \\ 10^ This increases the risk of virological escape from\nsecond-generation INSTIs, justifying continued epidemiological\nresistance surveillance of HIV-1.\n\n\n## Funding\n\nThis study was supported by internal funding.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 37399555\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: Of the 2 patients with early virologic failure in the viremic group, 1 patient had a decrease in viral load less than 2 log ~10~ at the first maintenance injection (from 214 540 to 39 293 copies/mL). A nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutation (L100I) was present on genotypic testing at this time, and injections were discontinued. The patient had not chosen to initiate oral ART as of database closure, and additional genotypic testing showed a new Y181I mutation in the RT gene. Risk factors for failure were a V179V/I mutation in the RT gene at baseline and rifabutin use 2 weeks before initiation of LA CAB--RPV. The second patient with failure was also noted to have a decrease in viral load of less than 2 log ~10~ at the first maintenance injection (from 137 134 to 4371 copies/mL) and, although the HIV viral load at the third injection was less than 30 copies/mL, genotypic testing was successful and showed an E138K mutation in the RT gene and an R263K mutation in the integrase gene. The baseline genotype resistance test had a minor integrase strand transferase inhibitor (INSTI) mutation (T97A).\nRationale: The paper mentioned that patients received LA (long-acting) cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV).

The baseline genotype resistance test had a minor integrase strand transferase inhibitor (INSTI) mutation (T97A).\nRationale: The paper detected drug-related mutations from patients using genotypic testing, hence it is most likely that the sequenced patients received ARV drugs before.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 29415189\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Patients and methods\nART-naive HIV-2-infected patients with detectable plasma viral load (>100 copies/mL) included in the ANRS HIV-2 CO5 Cohort were assessed. We performed ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) of protease, RT, integrase and gp105 regions. Only mutations in the HIV-2 ANRS list >1% were considered. HIV-2 tropism was assessed by V3 loop region UDS, and each read was interpreted with determinants of CXCR4-coreceptor use.\nResults\nAmong the 47 patients assessed, three displayed plasma viruses with a resistance-associated mutation (RAM) above the 20% detection threshold, all in RT, resulting in a prevalence of transmitted drug resistance for NRTI of 7.9% (95% CI 0.0%--16.5%). No RAM above the 20% detection threshold was found in protease or integrase. At the 1% detection threshold the transmitted drug resistance prevalence was 9.8% (95% CI 0.6%--19.0%), 13.2% (95% CI 3.5%--22.9%) and 4.5% (95% CI 0%--17.5%) for PI, NRTI and integrase inhibitors. The most prevalent MRV was the PI RAM I50V detected in three samples. Tropism analysis showed that 21% of patients (4 of 19) exhibited X4-tropic viruses: two in majority proportion and two in minority proportions (1.5% and 1.9%).\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of minority resistant variants (MRV) and resistance-associated mutations (RAM) in ART-naive HIV-2-infected patients using ultra-deep sequencing (UDS).

To delineate the effect of resistance mutations on viral susceptibility to integrase inhibitors, in vitro resistance selections with raltegravir and with MK-2048, an integrase inhibitor with a second-generation-like resistance profile, were performed. Mutation Q148R arose in four out of six raltegravir-selected resistant viruses. In addition, mutations Q148K and N155H were selected. In the same time frame, no mutations were selected with MK-2048. Q148H/K/R and N155H conferred resistance to raltegravir, but only minor changes in susceptibility to MK-2048. V54I, a previously unreported mutation, selected with raltegravir, was identified as a possible compensation mutation. Mechanisms by which N155H, Q148H/K/R, Y143R and E92Q confer resistance are proposed based on a structural model of integrase. These data improve the understanding of resistance against raltegravir and cross-resistance to MK-2048 and other integrase inhibitors, which will aid in the discovery of second-generation integrase inhibitors.\nRationale: The paper mentioned in vitro reistance selection, and all sequences were generated using site-directed mutation technology, which means the sequence were not from clinical samples.\nAnswer: Not reported\n\nPMID: 37399555\nQuestion ID: 1\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\nEvidence: Of the 2 patients with early virologic failure in the viremic group, 1 patient had a decrease in viral load less than 2 log ~10~ at the first maintenance injection (from 214 540 to 39 293 copies/mL).

We evaluated the\nten-year change in ARV resistance in people with HIV (PWH) in Korea.\n\n### Materials and Methods\n\nAdults aged ≥19 years and diagnosed with HIV infection between January\n2010 and December 2020 at a 750-bed municipal hospital were\nretrospectively reviewed. Data on clinical characteristics and\nresistance mutation test results were collected. The study population\nwas divided into three-year intervals according to diagnosed year and\ntheir clinical characteristics were compared.\n\n### Results\n\nA total of 248 PWH were analyzed, and ARV resistance was detected in 30\nof them (12.1%). Resistance was detected most frequently in PWH aged ≤29\nyears (16, 6.5%), and the median percentage of resistance detection per\nyear was 14.3% (interquartile range, 12.7 - 16.1). The trend of the\noverall prevalence of ARV resistance mutations slightly decreased and\nthen increased over time (15.3% in 2012 - 2014, 9.6% in 2015 - 2017, and\n12.9% in 2018 - 2020). The prevalence of the non-nucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance markedly decreased over time\n(15.3% in 2012 - 2014, 8.7% in 2015 - 2017, and 2.4% in 2018-2020),\nwhile that of protease inhibitor (PI) and integrase strand transfer\ninhibitor (INSTI) increased from 0 until 2018 to 3.5% and 8.2% in 2018 -\n2020, respectively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe trend of NNRTI resistance has decreased over time, and resistance to\nPIs and INSTIs increased from 2018. Therefore, continuous monitoring of\nARV resistance pattern is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### 1. Study design and data collection\n\nAll adults aged ≥19 years who were newly diagnosed with HIV infection\nbetween January 2010 and December 2020 at a 750-bed municipal hospital\nwith two infectious disease specialists were included. Clinical data\nwere retrospectively collected from electronic medical records. Data\nincluding demographics, comorbidities, and initial laboratory findings\nbefore or at the time of the first resistance test were collected.\n\nThe initial state of an HIV-infected person was evaluated using\nnon-specific laboratory data including complete blood count, hepatic and\nrenal function tests, and HIV-specific laboratory data including CD4+ T\ncell count and HIV RNA quantification by real-time reverse transcription\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results of HIV drug resistance mutation\nsequencing by PCR (AB 3500xL Dx genetic analyzer, Applied biosystem,\nWaltham, MA, USA) for each ARV class (nucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitor \\[NRTI\\], non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor\n\\[NNRTI\\], protease inhibitor \\[PI\\], and integrase strand transfer\ninhibitor \\[INSTI\\]) were reviewed, and data on gene mutation and actual\nresistance to each medication were collected and analyzed based on the\nHIV drug resistance database of Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA\n\\[ 13 \\].\n\nThe first test results from each patient were collected, and the\nenrolled patients were then divided into resistance and no resistance\ngroup based on their laboratory findings of ARV resistance. In patients\nwith ARV resistant mutation, it was confirmed whether there was an ARV\nchange in consideration of the resistance mutation. Because resistance\ntests for INSTI began only after May 30, 2018, at the research center,\nresistance data for this class were restricted. ARV resistance was\ndefined based on the test results.\n\n### 2. Ethics statement\n\nThe study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review\nBoard (IRB) of Boramae Medical Center (No. 20-2021-80), and the need for\ninformed consent was waived because of the retrospective nature of the\nstudy. All personal identifiers of the participants were anonymized\nprior to data processing. This study was conducted in compliance with\nthe principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n### 3. Statistical analysis\n\nResistance mutations were organized by year and ARV classes. In\naddition, the gene mutations detected throughout the entire study period\nwere analyzed.\n\nThe study population was divided into three-year intervals according to\ndiagnosed year and their clinical characteristics were compared.\nKruskal-Wallis test, Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used\nappropriately. The patients were also divided into resistant and\nnon-resistant groups. In the resistant group, the resistance trends were\nanalyzed by year and class of medication. Data regarding each drug, and\neach mutation were collected from both groups. A chi-square test or\nFisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables, and\nStudent's *t* test was used to compare continuous variables.\nKruskal-Wallis test were used for continuous variables when comparing\nthree separate groups. The Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to\nanalyze the prevalence of the resistance mutations trends of ARVs over\ntime. In all analyses, a *P-* value \\<0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS\nStatistics (version 28.0, IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### 1. Clinical characteristics of HIV-infected persons with ARV resistance mutation\n\nA total of 336 patients were screened, and 248 were included in the\nanalysis. A total of 86 patients were excluded, including 41 with low\nviral titers, 24 who were diagnosed with HIV before 2010, 19 who were\ndiagnosed with HIV in other institutions and had no resistance mutation\nresults, and two under 19 years of age. When the clinical\ncharacteristics were compared every 3 years by diagnosis year from 2012,\nmedian age became younger from 36 to 29 without statistical significance\n( Table 1 ). There was no statistically different prevalence of\ncomorbidities except decreased incidence of lymphoma (3/59 \\[5.1%\\] in\n2012 - 2014, and 0/104 \\[0.0%\\] and 0/85 \\[0.0%\\] in 2015 - 2020, *P* =\n0.013). Previous history of ART has been increased without statistical\nsignificance (1/59 \\[1.7%\\] in 2012 - 2014, 1/104 \\[1.0%\\] in 2015 -\n2017, and 4/85 \\[4.7%\\] in 2018 - 2020, *P* = 0.281), and there was no\nsignificant difference in CD4+ T cell count (median {interquartile range\n\\[IQR\\]}, 264 \\[60 - 473\\]/mm ^3^ in 2012 - 2014, 261 \\[124 - 419\\]/mm\n^3^ in 2015-2017, and 231 \\[84 - 341\\]/mm ^3^ in 2018 - 2020; *P* =\n0.177) and HIV viral load (median \\[IQR\\], 64,407 \\[25,508 - 183,076\\]\ncopies/mL in 2012 - 2014, 38,717 \\[11,636 - 133,834\\] copies/mL in\n2015 - 2017, and 49,789 \\[12,080 - 177,297\\] copies/mL in 2018 - 2020;\n*P* = 0.417).\n\nOverall patients were divided both resistance and no resistance group,\nand baseline characteristics were also analyzed ( Table 2 ). ARV\nresistance mutations were detected in 30/248 (12.1%) patients, and there\nwas no significant difference in CD4+ T cell count (median \\[IQR\\], 233\n\\[47 - 402\\]/mm ^3^ *vs.* 256 \\[116 - 399\\]/mm ^3^ ; *P* = 0.856)\nbetween resistant and non-resistant groups and HIV viral load (median\n\\[IQR\\], 60,320 \\[15,441 - 408,928\\] copies/mL *vs.* 48,815 \\[13,280 -\n152,005\\] copies/mL; *P* = 0.218) between the two groups. Other\ncharacteristics, including age, sex, comorbidities, and laboratory\nfindings, were not significantly different between the two groups,\nexcept for the incidence of lymphoma (2/30 \\[6.7%\\] *vs.* 1/218\n\\[0.5%\\], *P* = 0.039). ART was administered to 6 patients within 12\ndays before testing for ARV- resistance mutations, and ART resistance\nwas not detected in them.\n\n### 2. Overall resistance mutation trends of ARVs\n\nThe number of patients with ARV resistance, regardless of the ARV class,\nshowed little difference per year (median \\[IQR\\], 4 \\[ 3 , 4 , 5 \\]) (\nFig. 1 ). Resistance was detected most frequently in patients aged ≤29\nyears (16 patients, 6.5%). The median percentage of resistance detected\nper year was 14.3% (IQR, 12.7 - 16.1%). NNRTI resistance was most\nfrequently detected from 2010 to 2020, but its frequency decreased after\n2017 ( Fig. 1 ). PI or INSTI resistance was most frequently identified\nin 2019 and 2020. Resistance to only one class of ARV was detected in 27\n(10.9%) patients and resistance to two classes of ARVs were detected in\nthree (1.2%) patients. Mutations to three or more ARV classes were not\ndetected.\n\nFigure 1\n\n**Antiretroviral agent resistance mutation trends in Korea between 2012\nand 2020 according to drug classes.**\n\nARV, antiretroviral drug; NRTI, nucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitor; NNRTI, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; PI,\nprotease inhibitor; INSTI, integrase strand transfer inhibitor.\n\nThe trend of the overall prevalence of ARV resistance mutations slightly\ndecreased and then increased over time (15.3% in 2012 - 2014, 9.6% in\n2015 - 2017, and 12.9% in 2018 - 2020; *P* = 0.387) ( Fig. 2 ). The\nprevalence of the NNRTI resistance markedly decreased over time (15.3%\nin 2012 - 2014, 8.7% in 2015 - 2017, and 2.4% in 2018-2020; *P* =\n0.002), however, there was only a slight change in that of NRTI (1.7% in\n2012 - 2014, 1.9% in 2015 - 2017, and 1.2% in 2018 - 2020; *P* = 0.391)\n( Fig. 2 ). The prevalence of the PI resistance was only detected in\n2018 - 2020 (0.0% in 2012 - 2014 and in 2015 - 2017, and 3.5% in 2018 -\n2020; *P* = 0.980), and the prevalence of the INSTI resistance could not\nbe analyzed due to its initiation time. Interestingly, only the\ndecreased prevalence of the NNRTI was clinically significant.\n\nFigure 2\n\n**The prevalence of antiretroviral drug resistance mutations between\n2012 and 2020.**\n\nThe prevalence of INSTI resistance mutation was calculated from May 30,\n2018, to December 31, 2020.\n\nNRTI, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; NNRTI, non-nucleoside\nreverse transcriptase inhibitor; PI, protease inhibitor; INSTI,\nintegrase strand transfer inhibitor.\n\nAmong the 30 patients with ARV resistance mutations, 28 were started on\nART at our research hospital and two did not re-visit. Fifteen patients\nunderwent ART before the resistance results were reported and there was\nno change in the ART regimen after resistance mutations were found.\nAlthough the effects of resistance mutations were uncertain in 13\npatients beginning ART after confirmation of the results, there was no\ndifference in the initial regimen selection compared to that in patients\nwithout resistance mutations diagnosed during a similar period, and no\ncase that ART strategy was changed due to the resistant mutation\nresults. All 28 patients had been prescribed a single pill regimen since\n2015. Details of the resistance mutations, classes and ARVs of\nresistance, and effects of treatment on individual patients are\ndescribed in Supplementary Table 1 .\n\n### 3. Resistance mutation trends of ARVs: NRTI\n\nResistance to NRTI was detected in 4/248 (1.6%) patients, and NRTI\nsingle class resistance was detected only in two patients ( Fig. 1 ).\nAmong the 2 patients with NRTI single class resistance, L74I mutation,\nwhich resulted in resistance to didanosine and abacavir (ABC), was found\nin a patient, and T215D mutation, which resulted in resistance to\nzidovudine (ZDV) and stavudine (d4T), was identified in the other\npatient ( Supplementary Table 1 ). T215S mutation was detected in two\npatients with K103N mutation for NNRTI resistance. These patients were\nresistant to ZDV and d4T (NRTI), and delavirdine (DLV), nevirapine\n(NVP), and efavirenz (EFV) (NNRTI).\n\n### 4. Resistance mutation trends of ARVs: NNRTI\n\nThe proportion of resistance to NNRTI was the highest (20/248 \\[8.1%\\]),\nand all patients with resistance to two ARV classes had resistance to\nNNRTI ( Fig. 1 ). Resistance to DLV, NVP, and EFV was detected in nine\npatients ( Supplementary Table 1 ), including seven with K103N mutation\nand two with K101Q, K103R, and Y181C mutations. Simultaneous K101Q and\nK103R mutations were detected in a patient.\n\nResistance to DLV and NVP was detected in seven patients ( Supplementary\nTable 1 ). V108I, V179D, V179E, and K238T mutations were detected in\neach patient, and both V179D and V179E mutations were found in a\npatient. Resistance to NVP and EFV was identified in four patients.\nV179E mutation was detected in two patients, and two different sets of\nmutations were observed in another two patients (K103N and K103S; K103R\nand V179D). There were no patients with resistance to DLV and EFV or\nsingle ARV.\n\n### 5. Resistance mutation trends of ARVs: PI and INSTI\n\nResistances to PI (3/248 \\[1.2%\\]) and INSTI (6/248 \\[2.4%\\]) were less\ndetected, but the prevalence rates increased after 2018. Only nelfinavir\nresistance was identified in three patients, but the mutations were\ndifferent: A71T and M46L mutations in two patients and M46I mutation in\na patient ( Supplementary Table 1 ). E157Q mutation was detected in all\npatients with INSTI resistance with potential low-level resistance to\nelvitegravir (EVG) and raltegravir (RAL) ( Supplementary Table 1 ). Only\na patient had resistance to both INSTI and NNRTI with E157Q, K103R, and\nV179D mutations. This patient also had additional NVP and EFV mutations.\nThe overall INSTI resistance rate was 2.4%. However, the true percentage\nof INSTI resistance was 8.2% (6/73) because the resistance test for\nINSTI was initiated only after 2018 in the study hospital. Moreover, the\nnumber of patients with INSTI resistance has increased. After 2018,\nresistances to PI and INSTI increased, while resistance to NNRTI\ndecreased.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe WHO regularly reports global HIV drug resistance; however, Korea has\nbeen classified as a country in which such data are not available \\[ 10\n\\]. A previous report has suggested approximately 4.8% of V118I\nmutations in 42 ARV-naïve HIV patients in Korea in 2007 \\[ 12 \\]. The\npresent study confirmed different results, possibly due to the dramatic\nchanges in the treatment and prevention strategy and increase in the HIV\nincidence between the study period. Moreover, this study found that the\nresistance trends have changed within the 10- year study period.\n\nThe WHO has reported the overall prevalence of HIV drug resistance\nduring the period from 2014 to 2020 in people with HIV before initiating\nART (5.4% for NRTI, 12.9% for NNRTI \\[EFV or NVP\\], 0.4% for PI\n\\[atazanavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, or lopinavir/ritonavir\\],\nand 0.6% for INSTI) \\[ 10 \\]. In the present study, the proportions of\nARV resistance were different in Korea (1.6% for NRTI, 8.1% for NNRTI,\n1.2% for PI, and 8.2% for possible low-level resistance to INSTI). NRTI\nand NNRTI resistance rates were lower than those worldwide and decreased\nover the years ( Fig. 1 ). The proportions of resistance to PI and INSTI\nwere higher, especially a resistance of 8.2% for INSTI was observed\nafter 2018. The possible low-level resistance to EVG and RAL was high\nwhen compared to the prevalence of resistance to other ARVs, and given\nthe widespread use of these drugs, continued careful monitoring is\nnecessary. In the prevalence of ARV resistance mutations over time,\nresistance mutations of the NNRTI markedly decreased from 15.3% in\n2012 - 2014 to 2.4% in 2018 - 2020, and that of the PI (3.5%) was\ndetected for the first time in 2018 - 2020 ( Fig. 2 ). A recent study on\nthe trends in ARV resistance from another region of Korea reported the\nincreased overtime prevalence of NNRTI resistance from 1.5% in 2011 -\n2013 to 6.0% in 2017 - 2019 but no significant change of PI resistance\n(detailed numeric data were not shown) \\[ 14 \\]. Although these studies\nwere conducted in different regions of Korea, the markedly different\nresistance trends within the same country suggest the need for a\nlarge-scale, multicenter study.\n\nMechanisms of NRTI resistance are known to involve two pathways:\nimpairment of analog incorporation and removal of the NRTI from\nterminated DNA \\[ 7 , 15 \\]. It is important to evaluate NRTI resistance\ntrends because NRTI is the essential back bone of ART regimens \\[ 1 , 2\n, 3 , 4 \\]. The worldwide NRTI mutation rate was 5.4% \\[ 10 \\], but in\nthe present study, NRTI resistance was detected in only 1.4% of the\npatients, and all of those were ARV-naïve ( Fig. 1 ). M184V is a\nrepresentative mutation for impairment of analog, resulting in\nlamivudine (3TC) resistance \\[ 7 , 15 , 16 \\] and is often reported with\nL74V and Y115F mutations in patients with ABC resistance \\[ 16 , 17 \\].\nIn our result, there was no detected M184V mutation and 3TC resistance;\nL74I mutation likely associated with ABC resistance \\[ 18 \\] was\ndetected in only a patient ( Supplementary Table 1 ). T215 revertants\nrelated to virological failure to ZDV or d4T \\[ 19 \\] were found in\nthree patients, and a patient with T215 revertants had T215D and K103N\nmutations simultaneously. Thus, the frequency of NRTI mutations\ndecreased, and most of the ARVs to which resistance was detected in this\nstudy are not routinely recommended for ART \\[ 1 , 2 \\]; however, T215\nrevertants in treatment-naïve patients still need to be considered\nbecause of the relatively higher frequency of occurrence.\n\nResistance to NNRTI is the most frequently detected ARV resistance\nworldwide \\[ 10 \\], and the present study also revealed the high\nfrequency of NNRTI resistance ( Fig. 1 ); however, after 2018, the\noverall and single detection rates of NNRTI resistance reduced. K103N,\nthe most common mutation and frequently selected by EFV \\[ 7 , 20 , 21\n\\], was the one with the highest frequency, and K103R was detected in\nonly a patient after 2018 ( Supplementary Table 1 ). Y181C, a mutation\nmost frequently selected by NVP \\[ 7 , 19 \\], was detected in only a\npatient after 2018. Other mutations were less frequent and were not\ndetected after 2018, which could be due to the decreased prescription of\nNNRTIs.\n\nResistances to PI and INSTI were detected less frequently \\[ 10 \\]. In\nthe present, the overall PI or INSTI resistance rate was low, but the\nfrequency was found to be increasing. After 2019, all detected\nresistance were to PI and INSTI ( Fig. 1 ). However, the occurrence of\nA71T with M46L mutations or M46I single mutations was most frequently\ndetected; resistance to nelfinavir was detected in patients with these\nmutations. Resistance to boosted PI, known to have a higher resistance\nbarrier \\[ 21 \\], was not detected. Only E157Q mutation was detected in\nsix patients and reported possible low-level resistance to EVG or RAL (\nSupplementary Table 1 ). E157Q mutation is reported to be a natural\npolymorphism detected in HIV patients (1 - 10%) and dolutegravir (DTG)\nresistance could be elevated 10-fold in patients with E157Q and R263K\nmutations \\[ 22 \\]. Therefore, the increased frequency of E157Q mutation\ncould be a potential risk factor for increased DTG resistance in\npatients in Korea.\n\nThe selection of empirical ARV changed during the study period according\nto the development of the drug \\[ 23 \\]. Maybe, therefore, in the group\nwith resistance mutation, there was no case of confirmed resistance\nmutation to the selected empirical ARV. However, since it was confirmed\nin this study that the resistance mutation trend has changed, it is\nnecessary to continuously monitor how the resistance pattern changes.\n\nThis study has some limitations. First, the sample size was small, and\nthe study was restricted to a single center. In Korea, 10,522 Koreans\nwere newly diagnosed with HIV infection during the study period \\[ 24\n\\]. Only 2.4% of the patients were analyzed in this study. Moreover,\nmost patients lived in Seoul or Gyeonggi-do, and although half of the\npopulation in Korea lives in this area, the generalization of the\nresistance trends from these areas to the rest of the country should be\nperformed cautiously. Second, the HIV drug resistance database of\nStanford University used in this study is one of the algorithms widely\nused worldwide. However, different interpretations of ARV resistance are\npossible in other algorithms. To aid the reader\\`s understanding,\nhigh-level reduced susceptibility and reduced susceptibility to ARVs\nhave been highlighted in bold underlined text and bold text,\nrespectively, in Supplementary Table 1 .\n\nIn conclusion, the trend of the overall prevalence of ARV resistance\nmutations slightly decreased and then increased over time in Korean\npeople with HIV (15.3% in 2012 - 2014, 9.6% in 2015 - 2017, and 12.9% in\n2018 - 2020). The trend of NNRTI resistance markedly decreased over time\n(15.3% in 2012 - 2014, 8.7% in 2015 - 2017, and 2.4% in 2018 - 2020),\nand in 2018 - 2020, the prevalence of resistance PIs and INSTIs exceeded\nthose of NNRTI. Continuous monitoring for the pattern of ARV resistance\nis necessary.\n\n\n**Funding:** None.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 31600343\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: Among the 51 participants who had ARV drugs detected, 30 (58.8%) had HIV drug resistance.

Recently, WHO has emphasized the need to fast-track the transition to dolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral (ARV) treatments. However, continued surveillance of INSTI resistance is recommended. In this study, clinical, epidemiological, and virological features associated with INSTI resistance diagnosed in Spain were analyzed. Samples collected between 2008 and 2021 from HIV-1-infected patients were analyzed in integrase, protease, and reverse transcriptase using Sanger population sequencing. ARV drug resistance was evaluated with the Stanford University HIVdb program. Among 2,696 patients, 174 (6.5%) had INSTI resistance, all of them to first-generation INSTIs, and 71 (2.6%) had also resistance to second-generation INSTIs. Of these, only 5 individuals were exposed to DTG as the only INSTI, in whom resistance development was associated with poor treatment adherence and/or resistance to other ARV classes. Of newly HIV-1-diagnosed individuals, 0.92% harbored INSTI-resistant viruses, with low prevalences maintained along time, and only one had low-level resistance to DTG. Persons who inject drugs, age over 39 years, resistance to other ARV classes, and longer time from diagnosis were associated with INSTI resistance (p < 0.001). Non-subtype B INSTI-resistant viruses lacked the Q148H + G140S resistance pathway and showed lower INSTI resistance levels than subtype B viruses. In conclusion, INSTI resistance is uncommon and associated with long-term infections, older age and additional resistance to other ARV drug classes, and is rare in newly diagnosed HIV-1 infections. Our results also support the preferential use of DTG-containing regimens in first-line treatments, although surveillance of INSTI resistance is encouraged.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the analysis of drug resistance mutations and their prevalence in patient samples, but it does not mention conducting in vitro drug susceptibility tests.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 33119663\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: At least one ARV drug was detected in samples from 36 (25.0%) of 144 participants (19/94 [20.2%] from Tanzania, 17/50 [34.0%] from the DR, Figs ​Figs11 and ​and3).3).

The effect of this extensive treatment on transmitted drug resistance (TDR) of HIV is unclear.\n\nMethods\nTDR analysis was performed, based on the partial HIV-1 pol gene obtained from the newly reported HIV-1 positive cases from 2011 to 2019 in Shenzhen, China. The HIV-1 molecular transmission networks were inferred to analyse the spread of TDR. Logistic regression was used to identify the potential risk factors with TDR mutations (TDRMs) to cluster.\n\nResults\nA total of 12 320 partial pol sequences were included in this study. The prevalence of TDR was 2.95% (363/12 320), which increased from 2.57% to 3.52% after ‘treat-all’. The TDR prevalence was increased in populations with the characteristics of CRF07_BC, being single, educated to junior college level and above, MSM and male. The sensitivities of viruses to six antiretroviral drugs were decreased. The clustering rate of TDRMs remained stable, and the sequences in the three drug resistance transmission clusters (DRTCs) were mainly found during 2011–16. CRF07_BC and CRF55_01B were the factors associated with TDRMs clustering in the networks.\n\nConclusions\nThe ‘treat-all’ strategy might have contributed to a small increase in TDR, while most of the TDRMs were distributed sporadically, which implies that the ‘treat-all’ strategy is helpful for the control of TDR in high-risk populations.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\nEthics\nThe study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology (No. X190311577, approval date: 11 March 2019) and Shenzhen Center for Disease Prevention and Control (No. QS2021070037, approval date: 4 November 2021). All included patients provided written informed consent.\n\nStudy subjects and sample collection\nIn this study, we collected the blood samples and demographic data of newly diagnosed patients enrolled at Shenzhen from January 2011 to December 2019. The annual sampling rate exceeded 50% to ensure that a sufficient number of samples representing the current HIV epidemic situation were collected. All individuals were treatment naive at enrolment.\n\nSubtyping and HIV-1 drug resistance analysis\nNucleic acid extraction, PCR amplification work-up and sequencing were performed essentially as described previously.9 All available HIV-1 sequences covered a partial pol gene region (HXB2: 2252–3255). Subtyping was performed using Quality Control and COMET. A phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbour-joining method based on the Kimura 2-parameter model with 1000 bootstrap replicates in MEGA6. TDR mutations (TDRMs) were determined using the genotypic resistance interpretation algorithm of the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database.10 Mutations that could lead to low or higher resistance were judged to be TDR.\n\nHIV-1 molecular network inference\nWe inferred the HIV-1 molecular transmission network using previously described methods.9 After multiple sequence alignment, pairwise genetic distances were evaluated using the Tamura-Nei 93 (TN93)11 model by HYPHY v2.2.4. A genetic distance threshold of 0.5%12 was used to infer transmission networks using Cytoscape v3.7.2 and Gephi v0.9.0 software. Only clusters containing ≥3 sequences with the same TDRMs were defined as drug resistance transmission clusters (DRTCs).13\n\nStatistical analysis\nVariables were summarized as number and proportion for categorical variables, and median and IQR for continuous variables. Two-sample t-tests or Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric tests, and χ² or Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare continuous and categorical descriptive outcomes, respectively. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was applied to determine factors associated with TDR, such as age, sex, transmission route, subtype, marital status, education and the year of diagnosis.\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Characterization of the study population\n\nA total of 12 320 participants with demographic data and partial pol sequences (GenBank accession no. MW947591–MW957968, OP058117–OP058658) were included in this study, and 363 (2.95%, 363/12 320, 190 in 2011–16 and 173 in 2017–19) of them were identified with at least one TDRM (Table 1). The patients with TDRMs diagnosed in 2017–19 were younger than those in 2011–16 [median of 34.00 years old (IQR = 28.00–43.50) versus 38.00 years old (IQR = 31.00–44.00), P = 0.002]. Of the patients with TDRMs, the proportions of patients infected with CRF07_BC (42.77% versus 21.58%) or belonging to the population of MSM (58.38% versus 41.58%) in 2017–19 were higher than those in 2011–16 (P < 0.05 in all comparisons).\n\n### TDR prevalence in different stages\n\nThe prevalence of TDR increased from 2.57% (190/7403) in 2011–16 to 3.52% (173/4917) in 2017–19 (P = 0.002, Figure 1a), which was mainly related to resistance to NNRTIs (1.06% versus 0.66%) and PIs (1.20% versus 0.80%) (P < 0.05 in all comparisons). TDR prevalence in 2017–19 was higher than that in 2011–16 in patients with the characteristics of carrying CRF07_BC [3.40% (74/2175) versus 1.38% (41/2973)], being single [3.40% (97/2847) versus 2.36% (94/4014)], being educated to junior college level and above [3.59% (44/1245) versus 2.25% (34/1665)], being MSM [3.67% (94/2499) versus 2.14% (64/3329)] and being male [3.50% (143/4014) versus 2.55% (146/5874)], respectively (P < 0.05 in all comparisons) (Figure S1, available as Supplementary data at JAC Online). The most prevalent mutations (Figure S2) to PIs, NRTIs and NNRTIs were M46IL (n = 66), M184VI (n = 36) and K103NS (n = 50), respectively.\n\n\nThe prevalence of TDR to six drugs was increased significantly in 2017–19 (Figure S3, P < 0.05 in all comparisons): nevirapine, efavirenz, doravirine, nelfinavir, indinavir and darunavir. Of them, nevirapine and efavirenz were in the list of recommended antiretroviral drugs in China.\n\n\n### TDRMs in HIV-1 molecular transmission networks\n\nIn the analysis of the networks, no drug-resistant sequences of CRF08_BC, B and other subtypes clustered, and CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC and CRF55_01B were predominant in Shenzhen, accounting for 87.50% (10 775/12 320) of the total newly diagnosed infections. Thus, we analysed the transmission networks of CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC and CRF55_01B. 4923 sequences clustered in the networks and formed 814 transmission clusters (cluster size from 2 to 1625). There was no significant difference in the overall and each subtype sequences in the proportion of clustering rate in two stages (Figure 1b). Three DRTCs containing 33 sequences with TDRMs were identified in the transmission networks (Figure 1c), including V106M (n = 4), K103N (n = 4), N88D (n = 6), L210W (n = 16) and M46I (n = 3). Twenty-three of these 33 sequences (69.70%) were present in 2011–16.\n\n### Factors associated with clustering of TDRMs in 2017–19\n\nIn multivariable analysis, CRF07_BC (OR = 3.36, 95% CI = 1.58–7.16, P = 0.002) and CRF55_01B (OR = 7.49, 95% CI = 3.35–16.78, P < 0.001) were the factors significantly associated with TDRMs in 2017–19, while other characteristics such as gender, age, transmission route, year of diagnosis, subtype, education and marital status were not (Figure S4).\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this study, we compared TDR prevalence before and after the policy of ‘treat-all’ was implemented in Shenzhen, which facilitates the effective and timely development of optimal drug treatment regimens and interventions for newly infected HIV patients in the region.\n\nThe higher prevalence of TDR was found in 2017–19 in Shenzhen after ‘treat-all’, which is inevitable with the rapid increase in ART coverage and the decrease in treatment standards. The overall increase in TDRMs was mainly associated with NNRTIs and PIs, which may be related to the low genetic barrier of NNRTIs and their widespread implementation as first-line regimens in China since 2016.1 The proportions of TDRMs associated with nevirapine and efavirenz, which are in the first-line antiviral regimen in China, increased since 2016.\n\nAlthough the prevalence of TDR increased somewhat after 2016, the clustering rate of the sequences with TDRMs in the molecular transmission networks remained stable. The sequences that formed the DRTCs were mostly from patients diagnosed in 2011–16, which indicates that the change in treatment coverage inhibited the spread of DRTCs. The new TDR occurred sporadically and did not form clusters at high risk of transmission. The recent findings from clinical trials confirmed that the early use of ART keeps people living with HIV alive and healthier and reduces the risk of transmitting the virus to their sexual and drug-sharing partners.14\n\nCRF07_BC and CRF55_01B were the factors associated with TDRMs clustering in the transmission networks, and the TDR prevalence of patients infected with CRF07_BC was increased in 2017–19. In our previous description, CRF07_BC was the most prevalent HIV-1 strain in Shenzhen, which may be related to the higher proportion of MSM and young people associated with the subtype.13 The enhanced transmissibility and decreased virulence of HIV-1 CRF07_BC may explain its rapid expansion in China,15 and may explain its higher prevalence of TDR. CRF55_01B has the presence of the natural resistance mutation V179E,16 and more attention should be paid to the therapeutic use of drugs in patients infected with this subtype.\n\nIn this study, TDRMs were identified according to the 2009 WHO surveillance drug resistance mutation list, which implies that some newer TDRMs might have been overlooked in the analysis. But our findings revealed the changes in HIV-1 TDR in Shenzhen after ‘treat-all’ and provide important references for better HIV-1 prevention and control in the city.\n\nIn conclusion, the impact of the strategy of ‘treat-all’ on drug resistance (increased prevalence of TDR) is inevitable, while the transmission of TDRMs in Shenzhen was controlled in high-risk populations, and the prevalence of TDR remained at a relatively low level. Continuous and detailed drug resistance monitoring is still essential, and real-time molecular network monitoring is effective for precisely targeted interventions to halt the spread of TDR.13\n\n\n## Funding\n\nThis study was supported by the NSFC (31900157, 82173583), the State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity (AMMS), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2019B1515120003), San-Ming Project of Medicine in Shenzhen (SZSM201811071) and Shenzhen Key Medical Discipline Construction Fund (SZXK064).\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 35061671\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Materials and methods\nWe analyzed 1071 HIV-1 pol-gene fragment sequences (2253–3369 bp) from patients who were initiating or reinitiating first-line ART in six EECA counties, i.e., Armenia (n = 120), Azerbaijan (n = 96), Belarus (n = 158), Russia (n = 465), Tajikistan (n = 54), and Uzbekistan (n = 178), between 2017 and 2019. HIV Pretreatment DR (PDR) and drug resistance mutation (DRM) prevalence was estimated using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database. The PDR level was interpreted according to the WHO standard PDR survey protocols. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database and subsequently confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Transmission clusters were determined using Cluster Picker.\nResults\nAnalyses of HIV subtypes showed that EECA, in general, has the same HIV genetic variants of sub-subtype A6, CRF63_02A1, and subtype B, with different frequencies and representation for each country.\nThe prevalence of PDR to any drug class was 2.8% in Uzbekistan, 4.2% in Azerbaijan, 4.5% in Russia, 9.2% in Armenia, 13.9% in Belarus, and 16.7% in Tajikistan. PDR to protease inhibitors (PIs) was not detected in any country. PDR to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) was not detected among patients in Azerbaijan, and was relatively low in other countries, with the highest prevalence in Tajikistan (5.6%). The prevalence of PDR to nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was the lowest in Uzbekistan (2.8%) and reached 11.1% and 11.4% in Tajikistan and Belarus, respectively.\nGenetic transmission network analyses identified 226/1071 (21.1%) linked individuals, forming 93 transmission clusters mainly containing two or three sequences. We found that the time since HIV diagnosis in clustered patients was significantly shorter than that in unclustered patients (1.26 years vs 2.74 years). Additionally, the K103N/S mutation was mainly observed in clustered sequences (6.2% vs 2.8%).\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance and the genetic analysis of HIV-1 sequences from patient samples. It does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 36016383\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be transmitted via parenteral, sexual, or vertical exposure routes. The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals.

Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

We determined the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity in Bulgaria during 2012--2020 using polymerase sequences from 1053 of 2010 (52.4%) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. Sequences were analyzed for DRM using the WHO HIV SDRM list implemented in the calculated population resistance tool at Stanford University. Genetic diversity was inferred using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetics. Cluster detection and characterization was performed using MicrobeTrace. The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%).

This is extremely important\nin key populations such as female sex workers (FSWs), where the\nprevalence of pretreatment drug resistance (PDR) and associated risk\nfactors are unknown. In this study, we analyzed PDR and associated risk\nfactors in recently diagnosed and treatment-naive FSWs in Nairobi,\nKenya. In this cross-sectional study, we used 64 HIV-seropositive plasma\nsamples collected from FSWs between November 2020 and April 2021. To\nidentify HIVDRM, the *pol* gene was amplified and genotyped using sanger\nsequencing. The effects of age, tropism, CD4 ^+^ T cell count, subtype,\nand location on HIVDRM counts were examined using Poisson regression.\nOverall, the prevalence of PDR was 35.9% (95% CI: 24.3--48.9), which was\nstrongly influenced by K103N and M184V mutations, which confer\nresistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)\nand nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), respectively.\nSubtype A1 was predominant followed by subtype D with a notable increase\nin inter-subtype recombinants. We found statistically significant\nevidence that age was inversely related to HIVDRM. A FSW who is 1 year\nolder had 12% less HIVDRM (incidence rate ratios \\[IRR\\]: 0.88; 95% CI:\n0.82--0.95; *P* \\< .001), after adjusting for CD4 ^+^ T cell count,\nsubtype, location, and tropism. Similarly, an increase in CD4 ^+^ T cell\ncount by 1 unit, was associated with 0.4% fewer HIVDRM (IRR: 0.996; 95%\nCI: 0.994--0.998; *P* = .001), while controlling for the other\nvariables. HIV-1 tropism was not associated with HIVDRM counts. In\nconclusion, our findings show a high prevalence of NNRTIs. Lower CD4 ^+^\nT cell counts and younger age were significant risk factors that\ninfluenced HIVDRM loads. This finding underscores the relevance of\ntargeted interventions and the importance of continuing to focus on FSWs\nas a way of addressing the HIV epidemic.\n\n\n## 2. Methods\n\n### 2.1. Research ethics\n\nThis study was approved by the Kenyatta National Hospital - University\nof Nairobi Ethics and Research Committee granted ethical approval to\ncollect HIV-positive plasma for the HIV prevention and care program\n(KNH-UON-ERC: P258/09/2008). Participants in the study provided informed\nconsent for the storage and use of their samples in subsequent\nHIV-related research. Thus a waiver of consent was sought and granted\nfor conducting this HIV drug resistance study (KNH-UON-ERC:\nP556/07/2019).\n\n### 2.2. Study design and participants\n\nThis was a cross-sectional study that utilized 157 plasma samples\nobtained from HIV-1 seropositive and treatment-naïve FSWs between\nNovember 2020 and April 2021. The participants were recruited from 7 sex\nworker outreach program (SWOP) clinics in Nairobi County, specifically\nNairobi City, Donholm, Kawangware, Korogocho, Langata, Majengo, and\nThika Road. The study comprised subjects who satisfied the following\ncriteria: 18 years old; HIV-1 seropositive; treatment naive; located in\nNairobi county during the enrollment period (November 2020 - April\n2021); and engaging in sex work, defined as an adult who consents to\nsexual exchange for monetary gain. Among the exclusion criteria were:\ntreatment experienced subjects; subjects under the age of 18; and\nsubjects not participating in sex work as indicated above.\n\n### 2.3. CD4 ^+^ T cells profiling\n\nCD4 ^+^ T cell count/% were determined using BD FACSPrestoTM as per\nmanufacturer instructions. Briefly, blood samples were added to the\ninlet ports on the BD FACSPrestoTM cartridge using pipets provided. The\ncartridges were incubated on the workstation for 18 minutes at room\ntemperature before the tear strips were removed and the sample IDs\nmatching to the cartridges were inserted in the machine and read.\n\n### 2.4. HIV-1 viral RNA extraction\n\nHIV-1 RNA extraction from plasma samples was carried out using the\nInvitrogen PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as per\nmanufacturer instructions. Briefly 500 μL of plasma was lysed using 500\nμL viral Lysis buffer and 62.5 μL Proteinase K. The lysate was\ntransferred to sterile spin column, washed twice with 500 µL of wash\nbuffer, centrifuged at 6800g for 1 minute and then 17,000g for 1 minute,\nand finally eluted in 20 µL of sterile, RNAase-free water. RNA was\nstored at −80°C.\n\n### 2.5. The *pol* gene amplification\n\nComplementary DNA was generated using Superscript III 1-step RT-PCR Kit\nas per the manufacturers' instructions. Briefly, 1 µL of RNA was\nincubated at 65°C for 10 minutes and mixed with 39 µL RT-PCR Master Mix.\nThe cycling conditions were as follows: reverse transcription at 50°C\nfor 45 minutes, enzyme inactivation at 94°C for 2 minutes, PCR initial\ndenaturation at 94°C for 2 minutes, 40 cycles (94°C for 15 seconds 50°C\nfor 20 seconds , 72°C for 2 minutes), and a final 10 minutes extension\nat 72°C. For nested PCR, 2 μL of PCR products were amplified in a 50 μL\nreaction with AmpliTaq Gold LD DNA polymerase (Thermo Fischer Scientific\nInc., Massachusetts, USA) as follows: initial denaturation 94°C for 4\nminutes, 40 cycles (94°C for 15 seconds, 55°C for 20 seconds, 72°C for 2\nminutes), and a final 10 minutes step at 72°C. The amplified PCR\nfragment was purified using ExoSAP-IT PCR Product Clean-up Reagent as\nfollows, 10 µL of nested PCR product was mixed with 4 µL ExoSAP-IT\nreagent and incubated at 37ºC for 15 minutes, 80ºC for 15 minutes\nincubation, and cooling at 4ºC. All cycling conditions were performed on\nVeriti Thermal Cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Francisco, USA).\nThe amplified product (1.08kb) was verified by 1% agarose gel\nelectrophoresis and visualized on UVITEC Gel Documentation System\n(Cleaver Scientific, Cambridge, UK).\n\n### 2.6. Sanger sequencing\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific HIV Genotyping kit was used for the *pol* gene\nsequencing, and includes 6 overlapping primers. 2 µL of PCR product was\nmixed together with 18 µL of sequencing mix. The sequencing conditions\nwere as follows: 25 cycles of 10 seconds at 96°C, 5 seconds at 50°C, and\n4 minutes at 60°C and were carried out on an Applied Biosystems 3500xL\nDX genetic analyzer using the BigDye XTerminator kit (Applied\nBiosystems, Foster City, USA). The Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database\ngenotyping algorithm was used to identify drug resistance mutations from\nsequencing files that were automatically interpreted by RECall.\n^\\[\\ 11\\ \\]^ The *pol* sequences have been archived in the DDBJ\nNucleotide Database \\[LC723952-LC724015\\].\n\n### 2.7. HIV-1 subtyping\n\nHIV-1 subtyping was carried out by submitting raw *pol* sequences to\nREGA HIV-1 subtyping tool REGA, ^\\[\\ 12\\ \\]^ which predicted the HIV-1\nsubtype and associated bootstrap support level. The greater the\nbootstrap support level, the more precise the prediction.\n\n### 2.8. HIV-1 tropism determination\n\nHIV-1 tropism was determined using third hypervariable region in the\nviral envelope glycoprotein gpl20 (V3) loop sequences as described by\nAbisi and colleagues. ^\\[\\ 13\\ \\]^ Briefly, trimmed V3 loop sequences\nwere translated to the corresponding amino acid sequences, aligned, and\nanalyzed for coreceptor usage using various in silico genotypic tools.\nThere were tropism data for 58/64 subjects. The remaining 6 were imputed\nusing \"mice,\" an R package.\n\n### 2.9. Statistical analyses\n\nThe main outcome (dependent variable) of the study was HIVDRM counts,\nand the predictor variables were age, CD4 ^+^ T cell count and CD4 ^+^ T\npercentage, location of the SWOP clinic, HIV-1 subtype, and tropism\n(independent variables). To compare categorical variables and continuous\nvariables, respectively, Fisher exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test\nwere utilized, with 2-sided *P* values reported in all cases. Prevalence\nand associated 95% confidence intervals were computed using epiR\npackage. A Poisson regression was used to calculate incidence rate\nratios (IRR) and the associated 95% confidence intervals. Except for\ntropism, which was included in the final model regardless of statistical\nsignificance, all other variables were only included if they had a *P*\n\\< .25 at univariate analysis as they were deemed to influence the\noutcome. There was missing data for 6 subjects whose envelope gene (\n*env* ) gene could not be amplified for tropism determination, which was\nimputed using the R package \"mice.\" Statistical analyses were conducted\nwith the R statistical package (R version 4.1.0).\n\n\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. Demographic, clinical and virological characteristics of 64 treatment naïve FSWs\n\nTable ​ Table1 1 shows a summary of the 64 study participants'\ndemographic and clinical characteristics. There was 6 subjects missing\ntropism data which was addressed through multiple imputation. Prior to\nconducting the imputation, we determined that the data was not missing\ncompletely at random (MCAR), ( *P* = .0160), and thus multiple\nimputation where several imputed datasets are generated and combined\ninto a pooled result was appropriate. HIVDRM were found in 36% of the\nsubjects (n = 23). The overall median age was 36 years (IQR, 30--40),\nwith subjects with HIVDRM being on average 8 years younger 30 years\n(IQR, 28--36), when compared to those without HIVDRM 38 years (IQR,\n34--44; *P* = .001) (Fig. ​ (Fig.1). 1 ). The median CD4 ^+^ T cell count\namong subjects with HIVDRM was 291 cells/mm ^3^ (IQR, 159--499),\ncompared to 355 cells/mm ^3^ (IQR, 197--579) among those without HIVDRM.\nThere was a lower proportion of CXCR4 C-X-C motif chemokine receptor\n4-tropic viruses (33%) (n = 18), but there was no significant difference\nrelated to HIVDRM (Fig. ​ (Fig.1). 1 ). HIV-Subtype A1 largely dominated\nat 64% (n = 41), followed by subtype D at 14% (n = 9). There were 14% (n\n= 9) inter-subtype recombinants, distributed as follows: A1/D, 11% (n =\n7); A1/C, 1.6% (n = 1); and CD, 1.6% (n = 1). There were differences in\nthe predicted *pol* and *env* gene subtypes in 28% (n = 16), indicating\nthe possibility of dual infection or superinfection.\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\nDistribution of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations in the study subjects\nstratified by age and tropism. This density plot shows a right skewed\ndistribution with the circles depicting the location of the mutations\nwhile the curve shows the frequency of that mutation. In (A), subjects\nwho are \\<40 yr have more mutations, range (0--8) compared to subjects\nwho are 40 yr or older, range (0--4), and the difference is\nstatistically significant ( *P* = .001). In (B), subjects infected with\nCCR5-tropic viruses had a range of (0--8) compared to (0--6) for\nCXCR4-tropic viruses, and the difference was not statistically\nsignificant ( *P* = .80). CCR5 = C-C motif chemokine receptor 5, CXCR4 =\nCXCR4 C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4.\n\n### 3.2. Pretreatment drug resistance\n\nThe HIVDRM counts followed a poisson distribution and ranged from 0 to 8\n(Fig. ​ (Fig.1). 1 ). The complete HIVDRM and PDR profiles for all 64\nviral strains are shown in Supplementary Table 1,\nhttp://links.lww.com/MD/J147 . The overall prevalence was 35.9% (95%CI:\n24.3--48.9), which was strongly influenced by NNRTI prevalence 32.8%\n(95%CI: 21.6--45.7). The high resistance to NNRTIs was conferred mainly\nby the K103N 19% (n = 12) mutation, alongside P225H 3.1% (n = 2),\nV179E/L/T 4.7% (n = 3), G190A 1.6% (n = 1), Y181C 1.6%(n = 1), V108I\n1.6% (n = 1), and V106I 1.6% (n = 1) (Table ​ (Table2). 2 ). NNRTIs have\nlow genetic resistance, and a single NNRTI-related mutation confers\nhigh-level resistance to all 3 NNRTIs (NVP, EFV, and ETV). The\nprevalence of NRTI mutations was low, at 6.3% (95% CI: 1.7--15.2),\nsimilar to the prevalence of PI mutations, which was 4.7% (95% CI:\n1.1--13.1). Resistance to NRTIs was conferred by M184V 6.2% (n = 4),\nK65R 3.1% (n = 2), L74I 1.6% (n = 1), and Y115F 1.6% (n = 1) mutations,\ntogether with thymidine analog mutations M41L 1.6% (n = 1) and K70E 1.6%\n(n = 1). M184V/I confers high-level resistance to 3TC and ABC while also\nincreasing susceptibility to AZT and TDF, whereas K65R mutations confer\nintermediate resistance to TDF. Notably, 4.7% (n = 3) of the subjects\nhad high-level multi-drug resistance to NRTI and NNRTI drug classes. A\n1-of-a-kind case involved a subject who had drug resistance mutations\nacross 3 classes, implying a case of acquired HIV drug resistance\nthrough previous ARV drug exposure.\n\n### 3.3. Predictors of PDR\n\nThe strongest predictors of HIVDRM counts were age, CD4 ^+^ T cell\ncounts and % (Table ​ (Table3). 3 ). Due to multicollinearity between CD4\n^+^ T cell counts and CD4 ^+^ T cell %, only CD4 ^+^ T cell counts,\nalongside subtype, geographical location, and tropism, were included in\nthe final model. Chi-square goodness-of-fit test for poisson assumption\nhad a *P* value of .33 indicating good model fit. A FSW who is 1 year\nolder had 12% less HIVDRM (IRR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.82--0.95; *P* \\< .001),\ncontrolling for CD4 ^+^ T cell count, subtype, location and tropism.\nSimilarly, while controlling for model variables, an increase in CD4 ^+^\nT cell count by 1 unit (1 cell/mm ^3^ ) was associated with 0.4% fewer\nHIVDRM (IRR 0.996; 95% CI: 0.994--0.998; *P* = .001). When CD4 ^+^\nstrata (200 cells/mm ^3^ , 200--349 cells/mm ^3^ , 350--500 cells/mm ^3^\n, \\>500 cells/mm ^3^ ) are used in lieu of CD4 ^+^ T cell count as a\ncontinuous variable, we see that subjects with \\>500 cells/mm ^3^ had\n83% lesser HIVDRM counts than those with 200 cells/mm ^3^ (reference\ngroup). In this study, subtype A1 predominated (64%) and was used as the\nreference. While controlling for the other variables, subjects infected\nwith subtype C had 15.2 times higher HIVDRM (IRR 15.2; 95% CI:\n1.48--156; *P* = .022) than subtype A1 (reference). Subjects infected\nwith subtype D, on the other contrary, had a lower risk of HIVDRM, with\nan IRR of 0.10 (95% CI: 0.01--0.92; *P* = .042) after controlling for\nthe other variables. The geographic location of a subject also had an\nimpact on HIVDRM counts. Given that all other independent variables are\nequal, an FSW recruited from the city SWOP clinic is 32.1 times more\nlikely to have higher HIVDRM than an FSW recruited from the Thika road\nclinic (reference) (IRR = 32.1; 95% CI: 3.67, 281; *P* = .002). The 95%\nCIs were quite wide due to the uneven distribution of patients between\nthe HIV subtype and SWOP clinic groups, but this did not appear to be a\nconcern given that the computed coefficients' standard errors were\nreasonable. Tropism was not found to be a significant predictor of\nHIVDRM counts.\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nIn this study, we investigated PDR in recently infected treatment naïve\nFSWs. pretreatment HIV drug resistance can either transmitted or\nacquired resistance or both. Thus, for the purpose of this study, the\ndrug resistant viruses are assumed to have been transmitted at the time\nof infection (transmitted HIV drug resistance), since the subjects have\na history of follow-up from 1 of the 7 SWOP clinics, where sex workers\nhave access to HIV prevention and treatment services.\n^\\[\\ 14\\ ,\\ 15\\ \\]^ The rationale for establishing the SWOP clinics\nstems from the fact that sex workers face stigma associated with sex\nwork, and if they seroconvert, this underlying stigma restricts their\naccess to essential HIV services. Six subjects had missing tropism data,\nwhich was addressed using multiple imputation, which protected against\nstatistical power loss at the expense of adding noise or extra variance,\nwhich can cause bias. Failure to impute, and thus deletion of values\nwith missing values, would have resulted in bias as well as a loss of\nstatistical power.\n\nHigh levels of transmitted drug resistance have been described for\nantiretroviral drugs with low genetic barriers of resistance, after\nlong-term usage. These include M184I/V, linked with NRTI resistance, and\nK103N/S, Y181C/I, and G190A/S, associated with resistance to 1 ^st^\nNNRTIs. ^\\[\\ 16\\ \\]^ In this study, the prevalence of HIVDRM conferring\nresistance to NRTI was (6.3%), PI (4.7%), and NNRTI (32.8%). The high\nlevels of NNRTI resistance were due to the K103N, G190A, and Y181C\nmutations, which confer resistance to NVP, EFV and to some extent ETR.\nThis is not surprising as NNRTIs have a low genetic barrier to\nresistance. ^\\[\\ 17\\ \\]^ This is in line with findings that show\nsignificant increases in NNRTI resistance in east Africa (36%) and\nsouthern Africa (23%), with no increases for any other drug classes in\nany region. ^\\[\\ 7\\ \\]^ This could be explained by factors such as the\npharmacokinetics of these drug classes, as well as prior use of\nsingle-dose nevirapine in the prevention of HIV transmission from mother\nto child (PMTCT). ^\\[\\ 18\\ ,\\ 19\\ \\]^ M184V/I was found in 6.2% of the\nsequences and confers high-level resistance to 3TC and ABC while also\nincreasing susceptibility to AZT and TDF. ^\\[\\ 20\\ \\]^ The fact that 3TC\nis a backbone for most Kenyan ART-regimens isn't a cause for alarm as in\na triple combination, virological suppression can be accomplished by 2\nactive drugs. PI-resistant viruses were found in a small percentage of\nsubjects with no other resistant viruses except for the unique case with\nmultidrug resistance described previously. Except for the unique case of\n8 drug resistance mutations, the remainder of the subjects should be\nvirally suppressed by the current first-line regimens. This is in\nrecognition of the fact that many developing countries have limited\naccess to routine viral genotyping prior to ART initiation, and that\nroutine viral load monitoring is done 6 months after ART initiation and\nthen on a yearly basis to ascertain ART efficacy.\n\nHIV-1 subtype A1 was the most common subtype observed, followed by\nsubtype D with inter-subtype recombinants, particularly A1/D, in line\nwith past findings. ^\\[\\ 21\\ --\\ 23\\ \\]^ A significant increase in\ninter-subtype recombinants among recent infections, as seen with A1/C\nand C/D recombinants, suggests an epidemic shift. This expansion of\nsubtype D epidemic is likely to have negative consequences due to the\nobserved high virulence and faster disease progression of the D strain\nby itself or via recombinants. ^\\[\\ 24\\ ,\\ 25\\ \\]^ Evidence of dual\ninfection or superinfection was found in 28% of cases where the\npredicted subtype for the *env* and *pol* genes differed for the same\nsample. ^\\[\\ 13\\ \\]^ This could be attributed to reverse transcriptase\nenzyme which has a very high error rate, producing approximately 2\nmutations per 10 ^5^ nucleotides. ^\\[\\ 26\\ \\]^ The other plausible\nexplanation is template switching, which offers a significant mechanism\nfor HIV recombination at a rate of 3 to 30 template switches per single\ngenome replication. ^\\[\\ 27\\ \\]^ Moreover, superinfection with HIV is\npresumed to occur frequently because of the existence of interclade\nrecombinants, and has been observed more frequently in high-risk\ncompared to general populations. ^\\[\\ 28\\ ,\\ 29\\ \\]^ Although unlikely,\nit is possible that the subjects described were infected with a strain\nthat had different *env* and *pol* regions but the fitness of such a\nviral strain will be highly compromised.\n\nTo better understand how different factors influenced HIVDRM counts, we\nused a multivariable poisson regression model to predict HIVDRM counts\nbased on clinical, viral, and sociodemographic factors. We found a\nstrong association between younger age and higher HIVDRM counts ( *P* \\<\n.001), which is in line with previous studies. ^\\[\\ 30\\ \\]^ This\nobservation could be explained by the fact that younger FSWs are deemed\nmore \"attractive,\" and thus more likely to attract more clients,\nincreasing the likelihood of infection by different variants.\n^\\[\\ 31\\ --\\ 33\\ \\]^ This is exacerbated further by gender power\ndynamics, which may contribute to younger women being less likely to\nnegotiate condom use. We also found a statistically significant inverse\nrelationship between CD4 ^+^ T cell count and HIVDRM ( *P* = .001),\nwhich was also associated with tropism in the same samples. ^\\[\\ 13\\ \\]^\nCD4 ^+^ T cell number is an immunological marker for HIV disease\ndiagnosis, hence why it was previously used to determine the priority\nfor initiating ART before the current test and treat policy.\n^\\[\\ 34\\ \\]^ The low CD4 ^+^ T cell counts in the treatment naïve\nsubjects might be as a consequence of untreated HIV replication causes\nprogressive CD4 ^+^ T cell loss, or a faster decline in CD4 ^+^ T cell\ncounts in persons infected with transmitted drug resistance strains than\nin persons infected with wild-type virus during the first year, but not\nin subsequent years. ^\\[\\ 35\\ \\]^ However, contradictory findings were\nobserved where transmitted drug resistance viruses had lower fitness and\npathogenicity and thus had a higher initial CD4 ^+^ T cell count than\npersons with wild-type virus, which tended to disappear over time,\npossibly coinciding with the emergence of fitter variants. ^\\[\\ 36\\ \\]^\n\nIn a previous study using the same samples, we found that the Kawangware\nSWOP clinic was statistically associated with CXCR4 C-X-C motif\nchemokine receptor 4-tropic viruses. ^\\[\\ 13\\ \\]^ However, in this\nstudy, tropism was not associated with HIVDRM ( *P* = .57), nor was the\nKawangware clinic, but rather the Nairobi City clinic. Contrary to what\nwas found in the multivariable analysis, the result was different in the\nunivariable analysis, where, in addition to the Nairobi city clinic,\nDonholm and Korogocho were statistically associated with higher HIVDRM\ncounts. This is an ideal illustration of Simpson paradox, in which\nresults from whole data analysis contradict findings from subgroups of\nthe same data. ^\\[\\ 37\\ \\]^ This highlights the uniqueness of each\nclinic, though we cannot rule out the possibility of a sex worker\nvisiting a clinic away from their work location due to the stigma\nassociated with sex work. ^\\[\\ 38\\ \\]^\n\nCertain limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings.\nFirst, we examined mutations conferring resistance to NRTI, NNRTI, and\nPI, but not mutations that confer INSTI resistance. This is relevant\nbecause Kenya switched from using NVP- to dolutegravir-based regimens to\ntreat adults and children with virologic failure due to dolutegravir\nhigh genetic barrier to resistance. ^\\[\\ 39\\ \\]^ Second, there was no\ndata on viral load, which was due in part to the test and treat policy,\nwhich specifies that viral load monitoring is not required at the\ncommencement of treatment but is performed 6 months later to assess ART\neffectiveness in virological suppression. As observed in our previous\nstudy, viral load is an important predictor variable factor in the\ndevelopment of HIVDRM. ^\\[\\ 40\\ \\]^ Finally, due to a poor amplification\nrate, the study sample size was small (64/157), with 6 samples imputed\nfor tropism. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility of low study\npower as the cause of contradictory findings.\n\nIn conclusion, we present proof of the existence of PDR mutations in our\nFSW cohort. Alarmingly, 1 subject had a triple class drug resistance\nwhich is a cause for concern since from the onset the subject had very\nlimited treatment options. The K103N mutation, which conferred\nresistance to NNRTIs such as nevirapine and efavirenz, was a leading\ncause of PDR, while CD4 ^+^ T cell counts and age were significant\npredictors of HIVDRM counts. This underscores the importance of targeted\ninterventions for this vulnerable key population.\n\n**Funding acquisition:** Martin M. Mulinge, Dalton C.

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals. This retrospective study examines genetic sequences and clinical parameters like CD4+ T cell counts and viral load to understand the epidemiological and genetic characteristics of HIV-1 in the pediatric population in Rio de Janeiro.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 25970253\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Longitudinal trends of recent HIV-1 infections in Slovenia (1986--2012) determined using an incidence algorithm\nAbstract\nResolving dilemma whether the rise in the number of HIV diagnoses represents an actual increase in HIV transmissions or is a result of improved HIV surveillance is crucial before implementing national HIV prevention strategies. Annual proportions of recent infections (RI) among newly diagnosed persons infected with HIV-1 in Slovenia during 27 years (1986--2012) were determined using an algorithm consisting of routine baseline CD4 and HIV viral load measurements and the Aware BED EIA HIV-1 Incidence Test (BED test). The study included the highest coverage of persons diagnosed with HIV during the entire duration of an HIV epidemic in a given country/region (71%). Out of 416 patients, 170 (40.9%) had a baseline CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/mm ^3^ and/or HIV-1 viral load less than 400 copies/ml and were characterized as having a long-standing infection (LSI). The remaining 246 patients were additionally tested using the BED test. Overall, 23% (97/416) of the patients were labeled RI. The characteristics significantly associated with RI were as follows: younger age, acute retroviral syndrome, CDC class A and other than C, no AIDS defining illnesses, HIV test performed in the past, a higher viral load, and a higher CD4 cell count. An interesting trend in the proportion of RI was observed, with a peak in 2005 (47% of RI) and the lowest point in 2008 (12%) in parallel with a rise in the numbers of new HIV diagnoses. This study could help promote the idea of introducing periodic HIV incidence monitoring using a simple and affordable algorithm. J. Med.

Here, we amplified single genomes and characterized viruses, some of which were previously classified as subtype D by sub-genomic pol sequencing that were transmitted in Uganda between December 2006 to June 2011. Analysis of 5′ and 3′ half genome sequences showed 73% (19/26) of infections involved single virus transmissions, whereas 27% (7/26) of infections involved multiple variant transmissions based on predictions of a model of random virus evolution. Subtype analysis of inferred transmitted/founder viruses showed a high transmission rate of inter-subtype recombinants (69%, 20/29) involving mainly A1/D, while pure subtype D variants accounted for one- third of infections (31%, 9/29). Recombination patterns included a predominance of subtype D in the gag/pol region and a highly recombinogenic envelope gene. The signal peptide-C1 region and gp41 transmembrane domain (Tat2/Rev2 flanking region) were hotspots for A1/D recombination events. Analysis of a panel of 14 transmitted/founder molecular clones showed no difference in replication capacity between subtype D viruses (n = 3) and inter-subtype mosaic recombinants (n = 11). However, individuals infected with high replication capacity viruses had a faster CD4 T cell loss. The high transmission rate of unique inter-subtype recombinants is striking and emphasizes the extraordinary challenge for vaccine design and, in particular, for the highly variable and recombinogenic envelope gene, which is targeted by rational designs aimed to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility data.

To address this issue, we compared the latent viruses obtained from CD4 ^+^ T cells in peripheral blood and lymph nodes to viruses emerging during treatment interruption. Latent viruses were characterized by sequencing near-full-length (NFL) proviral DNA and env from viral outgrowth assays (VOAs). Five HIV-1-infected individuals on ART were studied, four of whom participated in a clinical trial of a TLR9 agonist that included an analytical treatment interruption. We found that 98% of intact or replication-competent clonal sequences overlapped between blood and lymph node. In contrast, there was no overlap between 205 latent reservoir and 125 rebound sequences in the four individuals who underwent treatment interruption. However, rebound viruses could be accounted for by recombination. The data suggest that CD4 ^+^ T cells carrying latent viruses circulate between blood and lymphoid tissues in individuals on ART and support the idea that recombination may play a role in the emergence of rebound viremia.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the characterization of latent HIV-1 proviruses and their role in viral rebound, but it does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 36146776\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: Monitoring HIV-1 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs) is important for disease surveillance. Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

Prior dosing regimen\nexperience was accounted for using 2 populations. Two models were\nconducted in each population---baseline factor analyses exploring\nfactors known at baseline and multivariable analyses exploring baseline\nfactors plus postbaseline model-predicted CAB/RPV trough concentrations\n(4 and 44 weeks postinjection). Retained factors were evaluated to\nunderstand their contribution to CVF (alone or in combination).\n\n### Results\n\nOverall, 1.4% (n = 23/1651) of participants had CVF through 152 weeks.\nThe presence of RPV resistance-associated mutations, human\nimmunodeficiency virus-1 subtype A6/A1, and body mass index ≥30 kg/m ^2^\nwere associated with an increased risk of CVF ( *P* \\< .05 adjusted\nincidence rate ratio), with participants with ≥2 of these baseline\nfactors having a higher risk of CVF. Lower model-predicted CAB/RPV\ntroughs were additional factors retained for multivariable analyses.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThe presence of ≥2 baseline factors (RPV resistance-associated\nmutations, A6/A1 subtype, and/or body mass index ≥30 kg/m ^2^ ) was\nassociated with increased CVF risk, consistent with prior analyses.\nInclusion of initial model-predicted CAB/RPV trough concentrations\n(≤first quartile) did not improve the prediction of CVF beyond the\npresence of a combination of ≥2 baseline factors, reinforcing the\nclinical utility of the baseline factors in the appropriate use of CAB +\nRPV LA.\n\n\n## METHODS\n\n### Study Population\n\nData from participants who received CAB + RPV LA dosed Q4W and/or Q8W in\nFLAIR, ATLAS, or ATLAS-2M were pooled in post hoc analyses. Data cutoffs\nwere through week 124 for FLAIR, week 96 for ATLAS, and week 152 for\nATLAS-2M \\[ 4 , 7 , 10 \\]. This analysis includes participants initially\nrandomized to CAB + RPV LA and participants who switched to CAB + RPV LA\nduring extension phases of the studies.\n\nFLAIR, ATLAS, and ATLAS-2M are randomized, multicenter, parallel-group,\nopen-label, phase 3/3b studies. FLAIR and ATLAS evaluated CAB + RPV LA\ndosed Q4W versus continuing daily oral therapy and ATLAS-2M evaluated\nCAB + RPV LA dosed Q8W versus Q4W. The full study designs and\neligibility criteria have been published elsewhere \\[ 5 , 8 , 9 \\].\nParticipants were ≥18 years of age and virologically suppressed (plasma\nHIV-1 RNA \\<50 copies/mL) at randomization. Historical genotypic\nevidence of any major INSTI or NNRTI RAMs, excluding K103N in plasma,\nwas exclusionary per the 2015 (FLAIR and ATLAS) and 2019 (ATLAS-2M)\nInternational Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) guidelines ( Supplementary\nTable 1 ) \\[ 25 , 26 \\]. Both FLAIR and ATLAS had an extension phase in\nwhich participants randomized to the daily oral therapy comparator arm\ncould switch to CAB + RPV LA Q4W or, for ATLAS only, could transition to\neither Q4W or Q8W dosing in ATLAS-2M. Thus, in ATLAS-2M, approximately\nhalf of participants rolled over from the daily oral therapy or CAB +\nRPV LA Q4W arms of the ATLAS study. Baseline characteristics were\nbroadly similar across the studies \\[ 5 , 8 , 9 \\].\n\nAll studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of\nHelsinki \\[ 27 \\]. All participants provided written informed consent,\nand the study protocols were approved by an investigational review\nboard.\n\n### Factors Explored for Association With Virologic Failure\n\nSex at birth, baseline BMI (continuous, linear term), HIV-1 subtype\nA6/A1, L74I polymorphism (including L74/L/I, but not any L74I mixtures\ncontaining M), CAB RAMs, other INSTI (non-CAB-specific) RAMs, RPV RAMs,\nother (non-RPV-specific) NNRTI RAMs, and Q4W or Q8W dosing regimen were\nexplored as potential predictors of CVF in baseline factor analyses\n(BFAs).\n\nAdditional MVAs evaluated the same covariates but also included the\npostbaseline factors: population pharmacokinetic (PK) model-predicted\nCAB and RPV trough plasma concentrations \\[ 28 , 29 \\]. Time points for\nmodel-predicted plasma concentrations were after first injections (week\n4 postinjection) and at week 44 postinjection (at the end of 6 Q8W\ninjections or 11 Q4W injections). For participants who withdrew before\nweek 44 postinjection, week 44 values were predicted based on available\ntime points.\n\nFactors identified as significant predictors in the final selected\nmodels were also used to evaluate CVF risk when present alone or in\ncombination in the overall population. Results were further evaluated by\ngeographical region (North America, Europe, and \"other\" regions) and by\ncountry.\n\nFull details of the methodology of genotypic and phenotypic analyses\nhave been published ( Supplementary page 1 ) \\[ 24 \\]. IAS-USA 2019\nHIV-1 drug resistance mutation guidelines were used to identify RAMs (\nSupplementary Table 2 ) \\[ 25 \\].\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\nTo explore potential factors associated with CVF, comprehensive\nstatistical modeling was performed with and without PK covariates: these\nare referred to as MVAs (including PK covariates) and BFAs (no PK\ncovariates). Kaplan--Meier curves of time to CVF were produced to\nsummarize CVF according to dosing regimen.\n\nIn addition to calculating the unadjusted CVF incidence rate per 100\nparticipant-years, multivariable Poisson modeling with backwards\nvariable elimination was used to account for the complexities of the\nexpanded analysis population ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). Dosing regimen\nexperience was accounted for using 2 distinct populations:\n\"single-regimen\" analyses and \"all-regimen\" analyses, with an MVA and\nBFA in each population. The single-regimen population comprised all\nintention-to-treat exposed participants who received only 1\nregimen---either Q4W or Q8W. For the MVA and BFA in this population, a\nzero-inflated Poisson model was used. The all-regimens model comprised\nall intention-to-treat exposed participants. In this analysis,\nparticipants who received both Q4W and Q8W regimens were included twice\nin the model, once for each regimen, contributing twice to the complete\nrecords count and only once to individual participant count. For the MVA\nand BFA in this population, a repeated measures quasi-Poisson model,\nincluding a sandwich covariance estimator, was used. Model-predicted\ntroughs after 44 weeks of injections were not included in the\nall-regimens MVA model because of the complexity of the repeated data\nstructure for participants receiving multiple regimens.\n\nA conventional backwards elimination variable selection algorithm was\nused in the models. Covariates were deemed to be statistically\nsignificant at a level of *P* \\< .05. Using significant predictors in\nthe final selected models, the risk of CVF was then examined in the\noverall population to understand their contribution to CVF (when present\nalone or in combination). Positive predictive value (PPV), negative\npredictive value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for\neach BFA outcome, along with subsets of MVA model variables, to\nascertain which combination of factors is optimal in predicting CVF.\n\nThe primary outcome of interest was the occurrence of CVF. The incidence\nof model-selected factors in participants with HIV-1 RNA \\<50 copies/mL\n(per the Food and Drug Administration Snapshot algorithm) was also\nsummarized. The time points for HIV-1 RNA \\<50 copies/mL Snapshot\nanalyses were week 124 for FLAIR, week 48 for ATLAS (no Snapshot\nanalysis performed at week 96 \\[ 4 \\]), and week 152 for ATLAS-2M.\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Participants\n\nAcross 3 studies, 1651 unique participants were included, 23/1651 (1.4%)\nof whom had CVF. The number of unique participants with complete records\nfor the covariates in each analysis is shown in Figure 1 .\n\nFigure 1.\n\nData collation.

The unadjusted\nincidence rate (95% CI) by dosing regimen was 0.42 (0.21--0.75) for Q4W\ndosing, 0.85 (0.37--1.68) for Q8W dosing, and 0.54 (0.15--1.40) for\nparticipants who switched from Q4W to Q8W ( Supplementary Table 3 ).\nFigure 2 shows time to CVF for the 3 regimen groups; CVF occurred\ninfrequently, with time to CVF similar by regimen. Overall, median\n(interquartile range) time to suspected virologic failure (first of 2\nconsecutive measurements of HIV-1 RNA ≥200 copies/mL) was 24.9\n(16.9--49.3) weeks.\n\nFigure 2.\n\nTime to CVF by regimen.

Supplementary Figure 2\nshows CVF outcome in relation to the individual covariates included in\nthe models. Of the 199 participants with HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, 11/180\n(6%) with subtype A6 had CVF and 2/19 (11%) with subtype A1 had CVF.\n\nThe BFAs included 1363 and 1431 unique participants with complete\nrecords in the single-regimen and all-regimens models, respectively.\nThree baseline factors were retained and significantly associated with\nincreased risk of CVF in both models: RPV RAMs, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, and\nhigher BMI ( Table 1 ). Additionally, the other NNRTI RAMs covariate was\nretained and significantly associated with increased risk of CVF in the\nall-regimens model. All other factors were not significant in the final\nmodels (including Q8W dosing regimen and L74I).\n\nThe MVA single-regimen model included 1224 participants with complete\nrecords and included all baseline factors plus model-predicted plasma\nCAB and RPV troughs. Five factors were significantly associated with\nincreased risk of CVF: RPV RAMs, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1 (associated with\nintegrase L74I polymorphism \\[ 18 , 19 \\]), model-predicted CAB trough\nconcentration 4 weeks following initial injection dose (early CAB plasma\nconcentrations are inversely correlated with high BMI \\[ 29 , 30 \\]),\nand model-predicted CAB and RPV trough concentrations at week 44\npostinjection ( Table 2 ). The other NNRTI RAMs covariate was retained\nin the final selected model but did not reach statistical significance (\n*P* = .0667). Notably, in a sensitivity analysis in which only CAB\ntrough concentrations were excluded, RPV troughs were retained.\n\nIn the all-regimens MVA model, which included 1292 unique participants\nwith complete records, RPV RAMs, integrase L74I, and model-predicted CAB\ntrough concentration 4 weeks after initial injection were statistically\nassociated with increased risk of CVF. Dosing regimen, other NNRTI RAMs,\nand model-predicted RPV trough concentration 4 weeks following initial\ninjection dose were retained in the final selected model but did not\nreach statistical significance ( *P* = .0612, *P* = .0963, and *P* =\n.1785, respectively).\n\n### Risk of CVF According to Combinations of Baseline Factors\n\nCVF risk according to combinations of the baseline factors identified as\nsignificant predictors in both BFAs (RPV RAMs, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, and\nBMI ≥30 kg/m ^2^ ) were examined in 1431 participants with complete\nrecords for these factors.\n\nCVF risk was higher in the presence of ≥2 baseline factors; 19.3% (n =\n11/57) of participants in this category met the CVF criterion through 3\nyears on study ( Table 3 ). Time to CVF by the presence of none, 1, or\n≥2 baseline factors is shown in Supplementary Figure 3 . Notably, the\npresence of ≥2 baseline factors occurred in 4.0% (n = 57/1431) of the\noverall population. The proportion of participants who had CVF with no\nfactors (0.4%, n = 4/970) or any 1 factor (2.0%, n = 8/404) was similar\nto the overall population rate of 1.6% (n = 23/1431). CVF among\nparticipants with a sole baseline factor was driven by RPV RAMs (3.2%, n\n= 1/31 with CVF) and HIV-1 subtype A6/A1 (3.8%, n = 6/157 with CVF); CVF\noccurred in 0.5% (n = 1/216) of participants with BMI ≥30 kg/m ^2^ as\ntheir only baseline factor. The model sensitivity and specificity of\nhaving ≥2 contributing baseline factors was considered optimal given the\n47.8% sensitivity and 96.7% specificity, with a PPV of 19.3% and an NPV\nof 99.1% ( Supplementary Table 4 ). Supplementary Tables 5--7 show\noutcomes by regimen, region, and country. Overall, 11 participants with\nCVF were from Russia, all of whom had HIV-1 subtype A6/A1 (\nSupplementary Table 7 *A* ). Because the other NNRTI RAMs covariate was\nsignificant in 1 model, including this as a \"fourth factor\" was explored\nfurther. Inclusion of other NNRTI RAMs had minimal impact, identifying 1\nadditional participant with CVF, and did not improve the overall\naccuracy of the diagnostic measures. When outcomes were assessed by\nK103N specifically, CVF only occurred when preexisting RPV RAMs were\nalso present ( Supplementary Table 8 ).\n\n\n### Risk of CVF According to Combinations of Baseline and Postbaseline Factors\n\nVirologic outcomes were summarized according to combinations of those\nfactors found to be important predictors in the MVA to see how these\nfindings could be applied clinically to assess CVF risk. Given the\ncorrelation between HIV-1 subtype A6/A1 and the integrase L74I\npolymorphism \\[ 18 , 19 \\], only HIV-1 subtype A6/A1 was included.\nModel-predicted first troughs were included versus troughs after 44\nweeks of injections, given their proximity to baseline.\n\nA total of 1292 participants with complete records were available for\nthis analysis ( Figure 1 ). Of participants with ≥3 baseline and\npostbaseline factors present (3% \\[n = 39/1292\\]), 20.5% (n = 8/39) had\nCVF with a 36.4% sensitivity and 97.6% specificity, and a PPV and NPV of\n20.5% and 98.9%, respectively ( Table 3 and Supplementary Table 4 ). As\nthe number of factors decreased, so did the proportion of participants\nwith CVF (≥2 factors, 7.3% \\[n = 17/232\\]; 1 factor, 1.3% \\[n = 5/396\\];\n0 factors, 0% \\[n = 0/664\\]). This same pattern was observed when\nincluding BMI ≥30 kg/m ^2^ as a fifth factor (≥2 factors, 5.7% \\[n =\n18/318\\]; 1 factor, 1.0% \\[n = 4/391\\]; 0 factors, 0% \\[n = 0/583\\]).\nAmong participants with initial CAB or RPV troughs ≤first quartile as\ntheir only factor, 0.6% (n = 1/160) and 0.7% (n = 1/137) had CVF,\nrespectively; when both CAB and RPV troughs were ≤first quartile, this\nrate was 2.7% (n = 3/113).\n\n### Pharmacokinetics in Relation to Virologic Outcome\n\nOf the 22 MVA participants who received CAB + RPV LA and had CVF, 18/22\n(82%) had model-predicted CAB and/or RPV trough concentrations within\nthe first quartile 4 weeks after initial injection, including 10/22\n(45%) with concentrations for both drugs in the lower quartiles (\nSupplementary Figures 4 *A--D* ).\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nIn this expanded analysis, CAB + RPV LA demonstrated high rates of\nvirologic suppression, with CVF occurring in 1.4% of participants. Of\nnote, numerically lower CVF rates have been reported (0%-0.5%) in the\nCARLOS, CARISEL, SOLAR, and CUSTOMIZE implementation studies \\[ 11 , 12\n, 15 , 31 \\]. The presence of a combination of ≥2 baseline factors\n(preexisting RPV RAMs, A6/A1 subtype, and/or BMI ≥30 kg/m ^2^ )\nincreased the risk of CVF, consistent with prior analyses exploring\npotential predictors of CVF within the first year of CAB + RPV LA \\[ 24\n\\].\n\nThe absolute difference in CVF incidence between the Q4W and Q8W\nregimens equates to ∼1 extra participant with CVF on Q8W over 200\nperson-years. Consistent with the previous MVA and BFA \\[ 24 \\], the Q8W\nregimen was not identified as a statistically significant predictor in\nany of the 4 models. This finding aligns with the noninferior efficacy\nof Q8W versus Q4W dosing demonstrated by the phase 3b ATLAS-2M study \\[\n6 , 9 , 10 \\]. The presence of a combination of ≥2 of the significant\nbaseline factors increased the proportion of participants with CVF 10-\nto 12-fold compared with a single factor across both regimens.\n\nIn the BFAs, preexisting RPV RAMs, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, and baseline BMI\nwere significant in both the single-regimen and all-regimens models. The\nother NNRTI RAMs covariate was also found to be significant in the\nall-regimens model, but when considered as an additional factor did not\nimprove the diagnostic measures. In the MVAs, which included\npostbaseline PK, RPV RAMs and HIV-1 subtype A6/A1 (single-regimen\nmodel)/L74I (all-regimens model) were retained as significant factors.\nModel-predicted CAB trough concentration 4 weeks following initial\ninjection was significant in the single- and all-regimens models, with\nmodel-predicted CAB and RPV trough concentrations at week 44\npostinjection being significant factors in the single-regimen model;\nhowever, most participants with CAB and/or RPV concentrations in the\nfirst quartile did not have CVF ( Supplementary Figure 4 *A* ).\n\nIn contrast to the BFAs, BMI was not retained in the MVAs, potentially\nin lieu of CAB concentrations because of the known inverse relationship\n( Supplementary Figure 4 *B* ) \\[ 29 , 30 \\]. Given this correlation,\nand that trough concentrations of LA therapy cannot be known before\ntreatment initiation, a patient\\'s BMI may be more useful to clinicians.\nUsing longer (2-inch) needles results in higher CAB troughs early in\ntreatment for individuals with higher BMIs; however, most participants\nwith a BMI ≥30 kg/m ^2^ in the phase 3/3b studies used standard needles\n\\[ 32 \\]. The integrase polymorphism L74I was retained in the\nall-regimens MVA, with HIV-1 subtype A6/A1 not retained; this contrasts\nwith the other 3 models and is likely because of the high correlation\nwith HIV-1 subtype A6/A1 \\[ 18 , 19 \\].\n\nWhen exploring combinations of the 3 significant baseline factors,\nparticipants with ≥2 predictive baseline factors (RPV RAMs, HIV-1\nsubtype A6/A1, BMI ≥30 kg/m ^2^ ) had an increased risk of CVF (19.3%\n\\[n = 11/57\\]). Notably, the presence of ≥2 baseline factors was\nuncommon (4%, n = 57/1431). The absence of any baseline factors was\nassociated with a low incidence of CVF (0.4% \\[n = 4/970\\]). No single\npredictor had a CVF incidence of \\>4%; notably, participants with BMI\n≥30 kg/m ^2^ as their sole factor had a CVF rate of 0.5% (n = 1/216).\nThis is aligned with a previous post hoc analysis demonstrating similar\noutcomes, regardless of BMI category (BMI \\<30 or ≥30 kg/m ^2^ ), for\npooled participants across FLAIR, ATLAS, and ATLAS-2M through week 48 \\[\n32 \\]. For participants with preexisting RPV RAMs as their sole factor,\nonly 3.2% (n = 1/31) had CVF supporting the multifactorial model.\nNotably, RPV RAMs for ATLAS and ATLAS-2M participants were identified by\na retrospective proviral DNA analysis. Reflecting clinical practice,\nvirologically suppressed participants were not screened for archived\nresistance as part of CAB + RPV LA clinical trials. When considering\nCAB + RPV LA, understanding the patient\\'s treatment history is\nimportant, including a review of RNA-based resistance tests, to exclude\nany history of treatment failure. Patient treatment history should be\nconsidered in combination with the presence of subtype A6/A1 and a BMI\n≥30 kg/m ^2^ to inform treatment decisions; screening for archived\nresistance is not a requirement for initiating CAB + RPV LA.\n\nWhen including model-predicted initial CAB and RPV trough concentrations\nas additional factors, the presence of ≥3 baseline and postbaseline\nfactors was associated with an increased risk of CVF, but only\nmarginally improved prediction of CVF beyond the presence of a\ncombination of ≥2 baseline factors. This suggests that clinicians can\napply the ≥2 baseline factors to inform patient selection. Although\nconsideration of PK concentrations as additional factors may lead to a\nsmall incremental reduction in risk, given the complexity of measuring\ndrug levels, the clinical utility of therapeutic dose monitoring is\nconsidered to be low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Supplementary Data\n\nSupplementary materials are available at *Clinical Infectious Diseases*\nonline.

Site-directed L74I and mutations observed in participants with CVF were generated in HIV-1 subtype B and a consensus integrase derived from 3 subtype A6 CVF baseline sequences. All 3 participants with CVF were from Russia and had the integrase polymorphism L74I at baseline.\"\nRationale: The paper mentions that HIV-1 sequences were obtained from participants in the FLAIR study.

Genotypic resistance testing was performed after the occurrence of VF, and drug plasma (trough) concentrations were measured after VF was established and on any other samples to assess on-treatment drug levels. CAB and RPV drug levels that were below the level of the population cutoff (SQ1) were considered as low drug levels.\nResults\nFive cases who were eligible for LA CAB/RPV experienced VF despite a low predicted risk at baseline. Genotypic resistance testing revealed resistance to either CAB, RPV, or both in all cases after VF was established. In 4 out of 5 cases, low drug levels were observed. The fifth case had adequate drug levels, suggesting other mechanisms behind these low drug levels.\nRationale: The paper focuses on clinical, virological, and pharmacokinetic analyses of patient samples experiencing virological failure during long-acting CAB/RPV therapy.

Three participants who received long-acting therapy had confirmed virologic failure (CVF) at Week 48, and all had HIV-1 that was originally classified as subtype A1 and contained the baseline integrase polymorphism L74I; updated classification algorithms reclassified all 3 as HIV-1 subtype A6. Retrospectively, the impact of L74I on in vitro sensitivity and durability of response to cabotegravir in HIV-1 subtype B and A6 backgrounds was studied. Site-directed L74I and mutations observed in participants with CVF were generated in HIV-1 subtype B and a consensus integrase derived from 3 subtype A6 CVF baseline sequences. Rilpivirine susceptibility was assessed in HIV-1 subtype B and A1 containing reverse transcriptase mutations observed in participants with CVF. HIV-1 subtype B L74I and L74I/G140R mutants and HIV-1 subtype A6 I74L and I74/G140R mutants remained susceptible to cabotegravir; L74I/Q148R double mutants exhibited reduced susceptibility in HIV-1 subtypes B and A6 (half maximal effective capacity fold change, 4.4 and 4.1, respectively). Reduced rilpivirine susceptibility was observed across HIV-1 subtypes B and A1 with resistance-associated mutations K101E or E138K (half maximal effective capacity fold change, 2.21 to 3.09). In cabotegravir breakthrough experiments, time to breakthrough was similar between L74 and I74 viruses across HIV-1 subtypes B and A6; Q148R was selected at low cabotegravir concentrations. Therefore, the L74I integrase polymorphism did not differentially impact in vitro sensitivity to cabotegravir across HIV-1 subtype B and A6 integrase genes (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02938520).\nRationale: They describe detailed experiments measuring the effectiveness of the antiretroviral drugs cabotegravir and rilpivirine against various HIV-1 strains and mutations.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 37399555\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: Of the 2 patients with early virologic failure in the viremic group, 1 patient had a decrease in viral load less than 2 log ~10~ at the first maintenance injection (from 214 540 to 39 293 copies/mL). A nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutation (L100I) was present on genotypic testing at this time, and injections were discontinued. The patient had not chosen to initiate oral ART as of database closure, and additional genotypic testing showed a new Y181I mutation in the RT gene. Risk factors for failure were a V179V/I mutation in the RT gene at baseline and rifabutin use 2 weeks before initiation of LA CAB--RPV. The second patient with failure was also noted to have a decrease in viral load of less than 2 log ~10~ at the first maintenance injection (from 137 134 to 4371 copies/mL) and, although the HIV viral load at the third injection was less than 30 copies/mL, genotypic testing was successful and showed an E138K mutation in the RT gene and an R263K mutation in the integrase gene. The baseline genotype resistance test had a minor integrase strand transferase inhibitor (INSTI) mutation (T97A).\nRationale: The paper mentioned that patients received LA (long-acting) cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV). CAB is an integrase inhibitor and RPV is an NNRTI.\nAnswer: NNRTI, INSTI"}

Rates of viral suppression to\n\\<50 copies/mL were 84.8%, 93.9%, and 95.4% before, 12 months after, and\n24 months after transition, respectively. Sex, age, pretransition viral\nload, and treatment backbone correlated with 24-month viremia.\n\n\n## METHODS\n\nData were derived from the Viral Load Cohort North-East Lesotho\n(VICONEL), a prospective open cohort including all people receiving HIV\nviral load (VL) testing in Butha-Buthe or Mokhotlong district in Lesotho\n\\[ 11 \\]. The VICONEL database incorporates routine demographic and\nclinical data collected at the time of VL testing that are\ncounterchecked by a dedicated data management team. Data closure for\nanalysis was on 1 May 2023.\n\nThis study includes all VICONEL participants who transitioned from ART\ncontaining an NNRTI (efavirenz or nevirapine) alongside 2 nucleoside\nreverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (abacavir \\[ABC\\], zidovudine\n\\[ZDV\\], or TDF together with 3TC) to ART containing DTG plus 2 NRTIs\nbefore 30 October 2021 (ie, ≥18 months before data closure), were ≥18\nyears old at transition, and had at least 1 recorded VL both before and\nafter transitioning.\n\nViral load outcomes are reported for the following time points: the last\navailable VL \\<12 months before (\"pretransition VL\"), the VL at 12\nmonths after (window: 6--18 months; ≥6 months before the 24-month VL;\n\"12-month VL\"), and the VL at 24 months (window: 18--30 months;\n\"24-month VL\") after transition to DTG. If multiple VLs were recorded\nwithin the window for the 12- or 24-month VL, the measurement closest to\n12 or 24 months, respectively, was selected. In addition, we report the\nlast available VL both before and after transition to DTG, regardless of\ntime window. VLs are categorized as \\<50 copies/mL, 50--999 copies/mL,\n\\>999 copies/mL, or missing.\n\nParticipant characteristics and VL outcomes are summarized as frequency\nand percentage for categorical data and median and interquartile range\n(IQR) for continuous data, and are reported stratified by the\npretransition VL. Determinants of 24-month viremia ≥50 copies/mL were\nassessed among participants with 24-month VLs using logistic regression\nmodels. The same analyses were performed combining pretransition VL and\nbackbone change to a single variable to address potential collinearity,\nand among the subgroups with a pretransition VL \\<50 copies/mL or ≥50\ncopies/mL. Upon observing an association of both a viremic and missing\npretransition VLs with 24-month viremia, we simulated the expected\neffect size of a missing pretransition VL assuming that any effect was\ndriven exclusively by undocumented viremia occurring at the same rate as\ndocumented viremia (see Supplementary Material section F ), and compared\nthe simulated with the observed effect size.\n\n## RESULTS\n\nAmong 14 242 eligible participants ( Supplementary Figure 1 ), the\nmajority were female (9311 \\[65.4%\\]) and taking efavirenz-containing\nART (13 049 \\[91.6%\\]) before and TDF-3TC-DTG (13 505 \\[94.8%\\]) after\ntransitioning. Median age at transition to DTG was 44.2 years (IQR,\n36.1--54.5 years). The NRTI backbone was changed at transition for 2539\n(17.8%) participants, including 235 of 496 (47.4%) with a pretransition\nVL \\>999 copies/mL ( Supplementary Table 1 ).\n\nAt the last available VL while taking NNRTI-based ART (regardless of\nwindow), 11 742 (82.4%) and 13 625 (95.7%) had a VL \\<50 copies/mL and\n≤999 copies/mL, respectively. After transition to DTG, 13 610 (95.6%)\nand 14 085 (98.9%) had a VL \\<50 copies/mL and ≤999 copies/mL,\nrespectively, at their last available VL ( Supplementary Figure 2 ).\n\nAmong 12 034 of 14 242 (84.5%) documented pretransition VLs, 9999\n(83.1%) were \\<50 copies/mL and 11 538 (95.9%) were ≤999 copies/mL.\nAmong 12 224 of 14 242 (85.8%) available 12-month VLs, 11 450 (93.7%)\nwere \\<50 copies/mL and 12 113 (99.1%) were ≤999 copies/mL. Finally,\namong 11 200 of 14 242 (78.6%) available 24-month VLs, 10 649 (95.1%)\nwere \\<50 copies/mL and 11 095 (99.1%) were ≤999 copies/mL. Figure 1  * ​\nA A * shows VL dynamics from the pretransition to the 12- and 24-month\nVLs among 8360 of 14 242 (58.7%) participants for whom all 3 VLs are\navailable. Of these, among 295 (3.5%) participants with a pretransition\nVL \\>999 copies/mL, 248 (84.1%) were suppressed to \\<50 copies/mL at 12\nmonths and 244 (82.7%) at 24 months, and 218 (73.9%) maintained\nsuppression at both time points.\n\nFigure 1.\n\n*A* , Viral load dynamics from pretransition to the 12- and 24-month\nposttransition viral load (VL) among participants with a VL at all 3\ntime points (N = 8360).

The simulated expected aOR for a missing\npretransition VL if any effect were driven purely by undocumented\nviremia occurring at the same rate as documented viremia was 1.21 (IQR,\n1.11--1.31; Supplementary Material Section F ).\n\nIn a subgroup analysis of participants with a pretransition VL \\<50\ncopies/mL, the same associations were observed (except backbone change\nfrom TDF-3TC to ZDV-3TC, which was dropped due to low numbers;\nSupplementary Figure 3 *A* ). In a subgroup analysis of participants\nwith a pretransition VL ≥50 copies/mL, pretransition viremia \\>999\ncopies/mL (vs 50--999 copies/mL) was associated with 24-month viremia (\nSupplementary Figure 3 *B* ). In a sensitivity analysis, the association\nbetween backbone changes and higher aOR of 24-month viremia appeared\nstronger among people with lower pre-transition VLs ( Supplementary\nFigure 4 ).\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThis study assessed 24-month virologic outcomes and determinants thereof\nupon programmatic transitioning from NNRTI- to DTG-based ART among\npeople with HIV in Lesotho. To our knowledge, this is the first study to\nreport real-world VL outcomes with DTG beyond 1 year of follow-up in\nsub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe vast majority of participants, including those with an elevated or\nmissing pretransition VL, achieved viral suppression by 24 months. An\nelevated or missing pretransition VL, male sex, young adulthood, and\ncertain backbone changes were determinants of 24-month viremia. In\nsimulation, the effects of missing pretransition VLs could partially be\nexplained by undocumented pretransition viremia if occurring\nproportionally to documented pretransition viremia. Backbone change\neffects were also observed with pretransition viral suppression,\nsuggesting underlying factors beyond (or in addition to) resistance. Of\nnote, only TDF-3TC is available as a fixed-dose combination with\nefavirenz or DTG in Lesotho, possibly impacting adherence; furthermore,\ncontraindications or prior treatment failure typically underlie the\nprescription of backbones other than TDF-3TC.\n\nWe observed viral suppression to \\<50 copies/mL among \\>95% of\nindividuals with 24-month VLs. Previous cohort studies in Lesotho (using\na cutoff of \\<100 copies/mL) and Malawi each observed rates around 98%\nwhereas a large cohort study in South Africa reported 90.5%, albeit all\nwith shorter follow-up \\[ 5 , 7 , 9 \\]. In line with our findings,\nprevious studies have observed an association of viremia \\[ 7 , 12 \\] or\nno recent VL \\[ 12 \\] at or before transition to DTG with subsequent\nviremia after transition; however, it is important to consider that the\nvast majority of individuals with prior viremia achieved viral\nsuppression after transition to DTG \\[ 5 , 7 \\].\n\nThis study is not without limitations. First, potential unmeasured\nconfounders cannot be fully accounted for. Second, our results are\nlimited to participants with documented VL before and after transition\nto DTG. They can thus not be extrapolated to participants who may have\ndisengaged from care or did not receive VL testing. Third, the inclusion\ncriterion of having at least 1 VL both before and after transition\nselects for individuals who remained in care for at least 6 months (the\ntime from ART initiation or transition to first routine VL testing) on\nboth NNRTI- and DTG-based ART. Finally, we do not dispose of adherence\nor resistance data.\n\nIn conclusion, after programmatic transitioning to DTG, the vast\nmajority of participants, including those with viremia or no recent VL\nbefore transition, had sustained viral suppression at 24 months\nposttransition. Based on our data, programmatic transitioning to DTG,\neven in persons without documented viral suppression, appears to be\njustified and beneficial.\n\n\n\n***Financial support* .** This study was funded through the Swiss\nNational Science Foundation (Excellenza grant number PCEFP3_181355 and\nR4D grant number IZ07Z0_160876/1 to N.

A total of 320 (86%)\nparticipants on DTG/3TC and 318 (85%) on TBR had both proviral genotype\ndata and ≥1 on-treatment post-baseline VL results and were defined as\nthe proviral DNA resistance analysis population. Archived International\nAIDS Society--USA major nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor,\nnon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, protease inhibitor, and\nintegrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance-associated mutations\n(RAMs) were observed in 42 (7%), 90 (14%), 42 (7%), and 11 (2%)\nparticipants, respectively, across both groups; 469 (74%) had no major\nRAMs at baseline. M184V/I (1%), K65N/R (\\<1%), and thymidine analogue\nmutations (2%) were infrequent. Through week 144, \\>99% of participants\non DTG/3TC and 99% on TBR were virologically suppressed (last\non-treatment VL \\<50 copies/mL) regardless of the presence of major\nRAMs. Results from the sensitivity analysis by Snapshot were consistent\nwith the last available on-treatment VL. In TANGO, archived,\npre-existing major RAMs did not impact virologic outcomes through week\n144.\n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1. Ethics\n\nThis study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki\nand national and institutional standards. Approval was obtained from\nethics committees at each investigational site. Written informed consent\nwas obtained from all participants before study initiation.\n\n### 2.2. Study Design\n\nDetailed methodology and study design for the TANGO study\n(ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03446573 ) have been previously published \\[ 2\n\\] and are briefly described below. Participants were excluded if they\nhad any evidence of IAS-USA major NRTI or INSTI RAMs in any historical\ngenotype assay results, if available; any plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement\nof ≥50 copies/mL within 6 months of screening; a total of ≥2\nmeasurements of ≥50 copies/mL or any measurement of \\>200 copies/mL\nwithin 6 and 12 months of screening; or a prior regimen switch for\nvirologic failure (HIV-1 RNA ≥400 copies/mL). HIV-1 proviral DNA\ngenotyping was conducted retrospectively with the GenoSure Archive assay\n(Monogram Biosciences, South San Francisco, CA, USA), which uses\nnext-generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze the HIV-1 polymerase region;\na bioinformatic filter is used to remove APOBEC3G/3F-induced G to A\nhypermutations. Although the NGS platform is able to detect variants as\nlow as 1%, resistance substitutions are reported at a mutation frequency\ncut-off of ≥10% \\[ 14 \\] to minimize over-reporting of APOBEC-mediated\nhypermutations. Participants' baseline whole blood samples were used for\nthe GenoSure Archive assay. Virologic outcomes based on IAS-USA major\nNRTI, NNRTI, PI, and INSTI RAMs \\[ 15 \\] were determined by the last\navailable on-treatment of HIV-1 RNA through week 144 in the proviral DNA\nresistance analysis population (PRAP) to assess on-treatment virologic\nresponse. The PRAP was based on the intention-to-treat--exposed (ITT-E)\npopulation for whom there were available proviral DNA baseline genotypic\ndata, and at least one post-baseline on-treatment HIV-1 RNA VL result\navailable, and reason for withdrawal was not a protocol deviation.\nSensitivity analyses were performed using the US Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) Snapshot algorithm at week 144 in the proviral DNA\nresistance Snapshot Analysis population (PRSAP), which was based on the\nITT-E population for all participants with available proviral DNA\ngenotypic data. Confirmed virologic withdrawal (CVW) was defined as\nHIV-1 RNA of ≥50 copies/mL followed by a second consecutive HIV-1 RNA\nassessment of ≥200 copies/mL. The list of major RAMs used in these\nanalyses was based on the 2022 IAS-USA update. Pre-specified INSTI\nsubstitutions (with major IAS-USA INSTI mutations bolded) are \\[ 15 \\]:\nH51Y, **T66I** /A/K, L68I/V, L74M/I, **E92Q** /V/G, Q95K, T97A,\n**G118R** , **F121Y** , E138A/K/D/T, **G140** A/C/ **R** /S,\n**Y143C/H/R** /K/S/G/A, P145S, Q146P, **S147G** , **Q148N/H/K/R** ,\nV151I/L/A, S153F/Y, **N155H** /S/T, E157Q, G163R/K, G193E, S230R, and\n**R263K** .\n\n\n## 3. Results\n\nOf 919 participants screened for the study, 543 (59%) participants had\nhistorical genotypic reports available and submitted for eligibility. Of\nthose with submitted historical genotypes, 9/543 (1.7%) participants\nwere excluded at screening due to pre-existing major NRTI resistance.\nAmong these nine ineligible participants, one had M41L and D67N, two had\nM41L, and the remaining six each had a single mutation identified as\nM184I, K65R, K219E, K219Q, D67N, or L210W. A total of 743 participants\nwere randomized and 741 received at least one dose of the study\ntreatments (exposed population). Of those treated, 464 (63%)\nparticipants had historical genotypes with 221/369 (60%) in the DTG/3TC\nand 243/372 (65%) in the TBR group. Retrospective proviral DNA testing\nwas performed on available baseline samples for 734/741 (99%)\nparticipants from the exposed population, with 330/366 (90%) in the\nDTG/3TC group and 324/368 (88%) in the TBR group having genotypic\nresults reported. The GenoSure Archive assay failed to provide a result\nfor 80 of the 734 (11%) samples tested. A further 16 participants, 10 on\nDTG/3TC and 6 on TBR, failed to meet the criteria for inclusion into\nPRAP, leaving 320 and 318 participants on DTG/3TC and TBR, respectively.\n\nThe overall prevalence of any archived major RAMs across four drug\nclasses was 26% in the PRAP ( Table 1 ).\n\nArchived NRTI RAMs were observed in 7% of participants and the frequency\nof M184V/I (n = 7; 1%) and K65N/R (n = 2; \\<1%) was low, being detected\nas mutation mixtures with wild-type virus in all cases. Major INSTI RAMs\nwere infrequent, being detected in 2% of participants, all as mutation\nmixtures with wild type. Pre-specified INSTI substitutions were observed\nin 26% of participants; the most frequent substitutions were polymorphic\nG193E, L74I, and V151I. Baseline characteristics (e.g., age, sex, HIV-1\nsubtype, baseline third agent class, median CD4+ cell count) were\nsimilar between participants with or without M184V/I ( Table S1 ). Of\nthe seven with archived M184V/I, four participants were in the DTG/3TC\ngroup and had a longer median duration of prior ART compared with the\nother three in the TBR group ( Table S1 ), whereas a similar duration of\nprior ART was observed in participants without M184V/I in both treatment\ngroups.\n\nThrough week 144, 319/320 (\\>99%) participants in the PRAP on DTG/3TC\nand 314/318 (99%) on TBR were virologically suppressed based on their\nlast on-treatment HIV-1 RNA. Participants with major NRTI, NNRTI, PI, or\nINSTI RAMs identified by proviral DNA sequencing had a similar high\nvirologic response: 81/81 (100%) on DTG/3TC and 87/88 (99%) on TBR,\nincluding four with archived M184V/I on DTG/3TC and three with archived\nM184V/I, as well as two with archived K65N/R on TBR ( Table 1 ). The\nfour participants, one in the DTG/3TC group and three in the TBR group,\nwho were not suppressed did not have any IAS major RAMs at baseline for\nall four classes of antiretrovirals or any pre-specified INSTI\nsubstitutions ( Table 2 ).\n\nNo participants in the DTG/3TC group met protocol-defined CVW criteria\nthrough week 144, while three participants in the TBR group (all without\nany archived major RAMs) met CVW criteria with no resistance observed at\nvirologic failure time \\[ 3 \\]. High suppression rates were also\nobserved at week 144 across both treatment groups, irrespective of the\npresence of major RAMs, using the FDA Snapshot endpoint in the PRSAP (\nFigure 1 ).\n\nFigure 1\n\nVirologic response (FDA Snapshot algorithm) at week 144 by archived\nresistance class for all participants in the ITT-E population with\navailable proviral baseline genotypic data (PRSAP) in the DTG/3TC and\nTAF-based regimen groups.

Discussion\n\nThe TANGO study demonstrated the safety and efficacy of DTG/3TC in\nparticipants without previous virologic failure or documented resistance\n\\[ 3 \\]. Baseline proviral DNA genotyping showed overall low frequency\nof archived, pre-existing resistance in line with the population\nincluded in the study. Similar results were noted in comparable studies\nin which a low rate of archived M184V/I was observed \\[ 12 , 16 \\]. A\nhigher rate of archived M184V/I was reported in the pooled analysis of\nstudies GS 1844 and 1878 for participants switching from either PI or\nDTG to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF).\nHowever, in these studies, proviral DNA analysis was performed in a\nselected sub-population of participants only, such as those with\nconfirmed virologic failure and those who switched to BIC/FTC/TAF with\n\\>10 years of prior ART, or with an unknown antiretroviral initiation\ndate \\[ 17 \\]. The long or unknown duration of prior ART may reflect the\nprior use of less effective ART, allowing for resistance development or\npossibly unrecognized prior treatment failures, which may explain the\nhigher rates of archived resistance in the GS 1844 and 1878 analysis.\n\nThe use of HIV-1 proviral DNA genotyping needs to be better defined and\ninformed with additional clinically based evaluations. Some assessments\nhave shown utility with DNA genotyping: several studies have shown that\nhistorical plasma RNA resistance tests were more informative than\nproviral DNA genotyping for documenting resistance mutations and guiding\nfuture treatment regimens in virologically suppressed individuals \\[ 10\n, 18 \\], whereas others have found good concordance between historical\nplasma RNA and proviral DNA genotypes and that resistance detected by\nproviral DNA genotyping can predict future virologic failure \\[ 9 \\].\nAnother example using proviral DNA genotyping-based ART switch showed no\nstatistically significant change in the probability of HIV-1 RNA of ≥50\ncopies/mL over time after the switch \\[ 19 \\]. Of note, there are a\nnumber of confounders of proviral DNA genotyping, including that\nclinically identified plasma RNA resistance may not always be detected\nby DNA genotyping \\[ 10 , 12 , 20 \\]. This may be due to the delayed\nappearance of resistance in proviral DNA compared with plasma RNA \\[ 13\n\\] and that detectability of archived DNA genotypic resistance may\ndecrease over time \\[ 11 \\]. Other limitations of proviral DNA\ngenotyping include resistance identified in defective (replication\nincompetent) viruses or mutations at very low levels with no apparent\nclinical impact. Additionally, the impact of archived mutations in\nproviral DNA would differ depending on the mutation type and its\nabundance, as well as the switch regimen components. Furthermore, proper\napproaches need to be applied when interpreting proviral DNA genotyping\nreports, as the NGS technology may overestimate APOBEC\nhypermutation-induced variants depending on reporting thresholds \\[ 21 ,\n22 \\]. Overall, HIV-1 proviral DNA genotyping results should be used\nwith caution, as reflected by current guideline recommendations \\[ 6 ,\n23 \\].\n\nIn the TANGO study, based on the PRAP, 319 participants (\\>99%) on\nDTG/3TC and 314 (99%) on TBR with archived resistance had a VL of \\<50\ncopies/mL up to 144 weeks by the last available on-treatment VL. A total\nof five participants (one on DTG/3TC and four on TBR) had plasma HIV-1\nRNA of ≥50 copies/mL by the last available on-treatment VL, with four\nnot having any major baseline archived RAMs and one having pre-existing\nmajor NNRTI resistance mutation V108V/I in the TBR group, indicating\nthat, in this study overall, the identification of archived proviral DNA\nresistance mutations had minimal predictive value on treatment response,\nas has also been shown in other similar studies \\[ 17 , 24 \\]. It is\nrecognized that the relatively small number of participants with\narchived resistance and the post-hoc nature of this analysis are\nlimitations on the extent to which these results can be generalized. A\nstrength of this analysis is the robust study design, including\nrandomized treatment assignment and long-term virologic response data,\nwith relatively few withdrawals. In TANGO, virologic suppression was\nmaintained through 144 weeks in participants with archived pre-existing\ndrug resistance treated with DTG/3TC. However, in line with the clinical\ntrial criteria and label, use in individuals with known resistance to\neither of these drugs should be avoided.\n\nThese results, along with other large-scale clinical trials, show that\ncareful consideration of previous treatment history and prior virologic\nfailure, as well as historical resistance reports where available, can\nhelp determine whether participants can be successfully switched to\nDTG/3TC. Further real-world experience in clinical settings using\nDTG/3TC has also added to the reassuring evidence supporting a\nsuccessful switch to DTG/3TC in stable virologically suppressed people\nwith HIV-1 \\[ 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 \\]. Overall, these results demonstrate\nno benefit in performing archived DNA resistance testing in a population\nwith no prior virologic failure and no documented prior resistance to\nINSTIs or NRTIs, as even in the few cases where archived resistance\nmutations were found, full suppression was maintained through 3 years.\n\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank the study participants and their families and\ncaregivers; the investigators and site staff who participated in the\nstudy; and the ViiV Healthcare, GSK, Pharmaceutical Product Development,\nand Phastar study team members.

Drug resistance mutations were analyzed by\nusing the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database system (\nhttps://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-mutations/ ). HIV-1 genotypes were\ndetermined by the REGA HIV subtyping tool (version 3.46,\nhttps://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/hiv ). Near full-length\ngenomes (NFLG) of HIV-1 viruses were obtained by next generation\nsequencing method.\n\n### Results\n\nSequences analysis of the *pol* gene revealed that CRF 01_AE (57.29%,\n228/398) was the dominant subtype circulating in Suzhou City, followed\nby CRF 07_BC (17.34%, 69/398), subtype B (7.54%, 30/398), CRF 08_BC\n(6.53%, 26/398), CRF 67_01B (3.02%, 12/398) and CRF55_01B (2.51%,\n10/398). The overall prevalence of drug-resistant mutations in cases\nwith ART failure was 64.57% (257/398), including 45.48% (181/398) for\nnucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) mutations, 63.32%\n(252/398) for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)\nmutations, and 3.02% (12/398) for protease inhibitors (PIs) mutations.\nTen near full-length genomes (NFLG) of HIV-1 viruses were identified,\nincluding six recombinants of CRF 01_AE and subtype B, two recombinants\nof CRF 01_AE, subtype B and subtype C sequences, one recombinant of CRF\n01_AE and subtype C and one recombinant of CRF 01_AE, subtype A1 and\nsubtype C.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThe high prevalence of drug-resistant HIV-1 viruses was a serious\nchallenge for HIV prevention and treatment of people with HIV infection.\nTreatment regimens for ART failure patients should be adjusted over time\nbased on the outcome of drug resistance tests. NFLG sequencing\nfacilitates the identification of new recombinants of HIV-1.\n\n\n## Material and methods\n\n### RNA extraction and Sanger sequencing\n\nViral RNA was extracted from 200 µl plasma sample following the\ninstructions of the MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I\n(Roche, Switzerland). The partial *pol* gene fragment of HIV-1 virus was\namplified by using in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method as\ndescribed previously \\[ 12 , 13 \\]. SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR\nSystem with Platinum™ Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, USA) was used for\nreverse transcription reaction and first round PCR. The second round of\nPCR amplification was performed using Premix Ex Taq™ Version 2.0\n(Takara, Japan) with a total volume of 50 µl. The length of the\namplified product was 1.3 kb (HXB2:2147 to 3462), including the full\nlength of the protease (PR) gene (1--99 codon) and the first 300 amino\nacids (1--300 codon) of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene. The\nsequences of *pol* gene fragments were obtained by Sanger sequencing\nmethod.\n\n### Genomes amplified and NGS\n\nThe near full-length genomes of recombinant forms of HIV-1 were\namplified using the methods described previously \\[ 14 , 15 \\]. We mixed\nall amplified products of the same sample in one tube. The combined PCR\nproducts were purified by using AMPure XP purification beads. Nextera\nDNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, USA) was used for sequencing libraries\nprepared. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on iseq\nplatform by using i1 V2 300 cycles reagent kit (Illumina, USA).\n\n### Sequence analysis\n\nThe Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV Sequence Database (\nhttp://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index ) and REGA HIV subtyping tool\n(version 3.46, https://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/hiv ) were\nused for determining genotypes of HIV-1 viruses. The suspected new\nrecombinant strains were submitted to Jumping Profile Hidden Markov\nModel (jpHMM-HIV) software ( http://jphmm.gobics.de/submission_hiv ).\nThe Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database system (\nhttps://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-mutations/ ) was used to analyze\nresistance-related mutations and resistance levels by comparing with the\nsequence of wild type and drug resistant strains. Neighbor-joining (N-J)\ntree of the near full-length genomes of HIV-1 viruses was constructed by\nusing MEGA 7.0 software with 1000 bootstrap replicates.\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Characteristic of subjects\n\nFrom 2017 to 2020, 450 people living with HIV who have received\nantiviral therapy for more than 1 year were confirmed to be ineffective\n(viral load ≥ 1000 copies/ml) in Suzhou city. Among these ART failure\npatients, a total of 398 viral pol gene sequences were successfully\nsequenced. Epidemiological features of cases with ART failure in this\nstudy were summarized in Table ​ Table1. 1 . There was no significant\ndifference in sex composition ratio, subtype distribution or viral load\nbetween group 2017--2018 and group 2019--2020. Males and females\naccounted for 92.96% (370/398) and 7.04% (28/398), respectively. A\nvariety of HIV-1 virus circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) were\nprevalent in Suzhou City. The dominant subtype was CRF01_AE (57.29%,\n228/398), followed by CRF07_BC (17.34%, 69/398), subtype B (7.54%,\n30/398) and CRF08_BC (6.53%, 26/398). Other subtypes mainly included\nsubtype CRF67_01B (3.02%, 12/398), CRF55_01B (2.51%, 10/398) and other\nCRFs (6.03%, 24/398). Among those who failed in antiviral treatment, the\nproportion of HIV-1 viral load in the range of 5000--100,000 copies/ml\nwas the largest, accounting for 62.56% (249/398).\n\n\n### Drug-resistance mutations\n\nAccording to the analysis of HIVdb Program, 257 strains were resistant\nto at least one drug of NRTIs, NNRTIs, or PIs, with an overall resistant\nrate of 64.57% (257/398). Frequency of drug-resistance associated\nmutations among cases with ART failure was shown in Fig. 1 . The drug\nresistant mutations associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs were 45.48%\n(181/398), 63.32% (252/398) and 3.02% (12/398), respectively. Among the\nPIs resistant HIV strains, four strains possessed PI-related major\nmutations (M46I/L, I54V, V82F) and the other 8 viruses had 3 accessory\nmutations (L33, FL10F and Q58E) in PR region. Respectively, 17 and 16\nloci in RT region were found emerging NRTIs and NNRTIs\nresistance-associated substitutes. M184V/I (40.70%, 162/398), D67N/G\n/S/H (13.82%, 55/398) and K65R/N (12.81%, 51/398) were the three most\ncommon resistance-related mutations regarding to NRTIs, while V106M/I/A\n(21.86%, 87/398), K103N/S (21.11%, 84/398), V179D/E/T/L (20.35%,\n81/398), G190A/S/Q/V/E (16.58%, 66/398) and Y181C/V/I (15.58%, 62/398)\nwere the first five mutations associated with NNRTIs-resistance.\n\nFig. 1\n\nFrequency of drug-resistance mutations among cases with ART failure\n\n### Resistance level to antiviral drugs\n\nWe analyzed the effects of mutations on drug resistance based on\nStanford University HIV drug resistance database (\nhttps://hivdb.stanford.edu/ ). No other HIV strains with high-level\nresistance to PIs were detected except 2020-SZ-83050 strain. Three\nsamples (2017-SZ-08303, 2018-SZ-08066 and 2020-XC-00107) with M46I/L\nmutation were resistant to ATV, FPV, IDV, LPV, NFV and SQV at a\npotential low level or intermediate. Besides, six samples were\nsimultaneously resistant to FPV, NFV and TPV at a potential low level\ncaused by L33F mutation, and one sample with L10LF mutation was\nresistant to NFV and FPV at low level. Resistance levels of different\ndrugs among ART failure individuals were shown in Fig. 2 . For NRTIs,\nthe resistant frequency to ABC, AZT, D4T, DDI, FTC, 3TC and TDF were\n45.48% (181/398), 15.08% (60/398), 31.66% (126/398), 45.98% (183/398),\n45.23% (180/398), 45.23% (180/398) and 28.14% (112/398), respectively.\nThe high-level of NNRTIs associated resistance was accounting for 20.10%\n(80/398), 51.26% (204/398), 56.28% (224/398), 5.28% (21/398), and 21.86%\n(87/398) for DOR, EFV, NVP, ETR, and RPV, respectively.\n\nFig. 2\n\nResistance level of different drugs among cases with ART failure\n\n### Analyses of NFLG sequences\n\nTen near full-length HIV-1 genomes (NFLG) covering from gag to nef genes\nwere obtained by using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The\nNeighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of NFLG of HIV-1 viruses was shown in\nFig. 3 . According to the results of jpHMM-HIV software (Fig. 4 ), six\nsequences (2017SZ-83245, 2017SZ-0319, 2017SZ-1093, 2017SZ-1942,\n2020SZ-83068 and 2020SZ-83463) were classified as recombinants of CRF\n01_AE and subtype B. They were also supported by phylogenetic analysis\n(Fig. 3 ), because these sequences were closer to CRF 01_AE than subtype\nB. They were inter-subtype of small fragments of subtype B inserted in\nCRF 01_AE gene sequence, but the recombination breakpoints of every\nsample were different (Fig. 4 ). 2017SZ-703 and 2017SZ-1982 were\nidentified as recombinants of CRF 01_AE, subtype B and subtype C.\nSequences 2017SZ-703 and 2017SZ-1982 were closer to C subtype than\nothers, indicating that they were recombinant viruses with subtype C\nvirus as the backbone while CRF 01_AE and subtype B gene fragments as\ninternal insertions. 2017SZ-0981 and 2020-SZXQ-256 sequences were\nrecombinants of CRF 01_AE and subtype C.\n\nFig. 3\n\nThe Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of 10 near full-length genomes of\nSuzhou HIV-1 recombinant viruses. Uncolored labels represent Suzhou\nHIV-1 viruses\n\nFig. 4\n\nRecombinant analysis of 10 near full-length genomes of HIV-1 viruses in\nSuzhou City, China\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nWith the increasing number of patients receiving antiviral treatment and\nthe lengthening of antiviral treatment time, the risk of drug-resistant\nmutations will also increase and eventually lead to treatment failure.\nThe viral load in people receiving treatment is high, suggesting that\nthere is a potential for drug resistance \\[ 16 \\]. Besides, HIV viruses,\nwhich were sensitive to ART, could be converted to drug-resistant\nstrains under the influence of body immunity, drug selection pressure\nand other factors, such as poor compliance and incorrect drug dose \\[ 17\n, 18 \\]. Studies have shown that some resistance-related substitutions\nwill make the HIV-1 virus resistant to multiple drugs and increase the\nrisk of spread to others \\[ 19 \\]. HIV-1 viruses did not possess the\ndrug resistant-related amino acids indicating that these strains\nprobably exhibit sensitivity to corresponding drugs. However, among all\nthe identified strains, 3.02%, 45.48% and 63.32% HIV-1 viruses were\nconfirmed resistance to PIs, NRTIs and NNRTIs. The drug resistance rates\nof NRTIs and NNRTIs were similar to previous studies in other countries\n\\[ 18 , 20 \\]. For example, the resistance rates of NRTIs and NNRTIs\nwere 83.0% and 88.7% among treatment failures in Philippines. The\nregimen consisted of TDF/AZT, 3TC and EFV/NVP is currently the most\ncommon acquired free first-line treatment in China. Unfortunately,\n28.14%/15.08%, 45.23%, 51.26%/56.28% of HIV-1 virus strains have a\ncertain degree of resistance to the above drugs, respectively. The high\nprevalence of drug-resistant HIV may lead to treatment failure and\nfurther spread, which will be detrimental to epidemic control. It is\nnecessary to carry out drug resistance testing in time and adjust the\ntreatment plan according to the results.\n\nThe distribution of HIV subtypes varies considerably across regions \\[ 5\n\\]. In this study, at least 8 subtypes/CRFs were identified. The\nsubtypes/CRFs distribution of HIV-1 in Suzhou City is similar to that in\nother areas according to previous studies \\[ 21 -- 24 \\], with CRF01_AE\naccounting for the majority, followed by CRF07_BC, subtype B and other\nsubtypes. However, some other surveys in China showed different results,\nsuch as that in Yunnan province \\[ 25 \\] and Minority Area \\[ 26 \\].\nBesides, it was also different from that in Sierra Leone, Africa \\[ 27\n\\] or Florida, American \\[ 28 \\], with CRF 02_AG and subtype B as the\nmost common genotype, respectively. The HIV virus may benefit from the\nM46I, L33F and L10F substitutions, which can improve its resistance to\nPIs. In this study, V106M/I/A, K103N and V179D/E/T/L were the first\nthree common mutations associated with NNRTIs resistance while M184V/I,\nD67N/G/S/H and K65R/N were the first three common mutations associated\nwith NRTIs. These mutations were also high-frequency reported previous\nliteratures \\[ 18 , 29 -- 31 \\].\n\nThe probable emergence and spread of novel resistant strains deserve\ngreat attention. If viral genomes were recombinant and diverse, they\ncould not be completely characterize using partial genomic sequences.\nFull genome sequencing can be used to confirm recombinants when viruses\ntyping were unclassified or the results of different gene segments were\ninconsistent. A number of new HIV recombinants have been reported by\nnear-full-length genome sequencing \\[ 32 -- 35 \\]. In this study, 12\nrecombinants were confirmed by performing full genome sequencing. All\nrecombinant strains contained CRF 01_AE gene fragments. This may be\nrelated to the high prevalence of CRF 01_AE in the local area.\n\nIn conclusion, because of the severity and high fatality rate of HIV\ninfections, the prevalence of drug resistant mutations HIV has aroused\nwidespread social concern and posed a threat to public health. It is\nnecessary to continuously monitor CD4 ^+^ T cell counts, viral load and\ndrug-resistance mutations in order to timely adjust the medication\nregimen during antiviral therapy. The characteristics of genotypes and\ndrug-resistance of the HIV-1 virus in Suzhou City were preliminary\ndescribed in this study, but more and in-depth researches are required\nto provide more accurate scientific basis for HIV-infected prevention\nand control.\n\n## Funding\n\nThis study was supported by Suzhou Key technologies for the Prevention\nand Control of Major and Infectious Diseases (GWZX201902), The Key\nMedical Discipline of Suzhou (SZXK202117) and \"National Tutorial System\"\nTraining Project for Young Health Backbone Talents in Suzhou\n(QNGG2022030).\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 36146776\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: Monitoring HIV-1 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs) is important for disease surveillance. Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

The mean age of the participants was calculated to be 32.21 yr and over half of the patients (n=16) were male and the mean time of HARRT use was 47.69 months.  Standard first-line regimen in Iran is comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI);  drug resistance mutations for the 3 classes of ART (NNRTI, NRTI, and PI) were observed and 4 samples showed resistance to all of them.\nRationale: The paper mentions the patients got standard treatment, and the evidence indicates the presence of mutations associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, suggesting that individuals in the study had received these drug classes prior to sample sequencing.\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI\n\nPMID: 36016383\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be transmitted via parenteral, sexual, or vertical exposure routes. The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals.

The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%). Most (34/60, 56.7%) of the SDRMs were present in transmission clusters of different subtypes composed mostly of male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC), including a 14-member cluster of subtype B sequences from 12 MMSC and two males reporting heterosexual contact; 13 had the L90M PI mutation and one had the T215S NRTI SDRM. We found a low SDRM prevalence amid high HIV-1 diversity among ART-naive patients in Bulgaria during 2012--2020. The majority of SDRMs were found in transmission clusters containing MMSC, indicative of onward spread of SDRM in drug-naive individuals. Our study provides valuable information on the transmission dynamics of HIV drug resistance in the context of high genetic diversity in Bulgaria, for the development of enhanced prevention strategies to end the epidemic.\n\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity using sequences from ART-naive individuals.

Our study aims to describe the circulation of major\nresistance-associated mutations (RAMs) for NNRTIs in people living with\nHIV (PLWH) in Italy from 2000 to 2020. We included 5982 naïves and\n28 505 genotypes from 9387 treatment-experienced PLWH from the Antiviral\nResponse Cohort Analysis (ARCA) cohort. Transmitted drug resistance\n(TDR) was found in 12.5% and declined from 17.3% in 2000--2003 to 10.9%\nin 2016--2020 ( *p* = 0.003). Predictors of TDR were viral subtype B\n\\[vs. non-B, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.94, *p* \\< 0.001\\], zenith\nviral load (VL) (per 1 log ~10~ higher, aOR = 0.86, *p* = 0.013), nadir\nCD4 cell count (per 100 cells/μL increase aOR = 0.95, *p* = 0.013).

Predictors of PDR\nwere sexual transmission route (vs. others, aOR = 0.78, *p* \\< 0.001),\ntime since HIV diagnosis (per 1 month longer, aOR = 1.002, *p*\n\\< 0.001), viral subtype B (vs. non B, aOR = 1.37, *p* \\< 0.001), VL\n(per 1 log ~10~ higher, aOR = 1.12, *p* \\< 0.001), nadir CD4 count (per\n100 cells/μL increase, aOR = 0.91, *p* \\< 0.001), previous exposure to\nany NNRTI (aOR = 2.31, *p* \\< 0.001) and a more recent calendar year\nsequence (any time span \\> 2008 vs. 2000--2003, any aOR \\<1, *p*\n\\< 0.001). Circulation of RAMs to NNRTIs declined during the last\n20 years in Italy. NNRTIs remain pivotal drugs for the management of\nHIV-1 due to safety concerns and long-acting options.\n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nWe retrieved HIV-1 RNA protease/reverse transcriptase sequences,\ndemographic and clinical data of adult PLWH from the Antiviral Response\nCohort Analysis (ARCA) database, a public observational database\ncontaining data from more than 100 Italian centres for the study of\nresistance mutations to antiviral drugs for HIV, hepatitis B and\nhepatitis C virus infections \\[ 5 \\]. Transmitted drug resistance (TDR)\nwas defined as the presence of RAMs transmitted at the moment of the\ninfection, considering genotypes of naïve PLWH \\[ 6 \\], while\npre-treatment drug resistance (PDR) identifies the sum of drug\nresistance mutations detected in all genotypes of experienced PLWH with\nprevious ARV drug exposure initiating or reinitiating ART, including\nboth transmitted and acquired RAMs, at the moment of the analysis \\[ 6\n\\]. TDR and PDR were defined as the presence of at least one mutation\nlisted in the updated International Antiviral Sociey-USA and Stanford\nlists \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. The HIV-1 genotype was considered based on all the\ntests available (cumulative genotype).\n\nThe genotypic susceptibility score (GSS) for a single compound was\nobtained using the Stanford HIVdb genotypic resistance interpretation\nsystem: a GSS value of 0 corresponds to high-level resistance, 0.25 to\nintermediate resistance, 0.50 to low-level resistance, 0.75 to potential\nlow-level resistance, and 1 to full susceptibility.\n\nThe cumulative GSS (cGSS) of the single compound was calculated for the\ncumulative genotype using the Stanford algorithm interpretation as the\nminimum value \\[ 9 \\].\n\nUnivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed\nto evaluate the association between NNRTI drug resistance and its\npredictors. Factors significantly associated with NNRTI resistance were\nincluded in the multivariate analysis. A *p* \\< 0.05 value was\nconsidered significant. The changes in the prevalence of RAMs over time\nwere evaluated using the χ ^2^ -test for trend. All analyses were\nperformed using the SPSS software package (v. 25).\n\n::: section\n\n## RESULTS\n\nWe included 5982 naïves: 73.9% were males, median age was 39 years\n\\[interquartile range (IQR): 32--47\\] and 67.9% were Caucasian. The main\nroute of transmission was sexual intercourse (54.6%). The median time\nsince HIV diagnosis was 3.14 weeks (0.86--41.93), nadir CD4 count was\n326 cells/μL (159--495) and zenith HIV-1 RNA (viral load, VL) was 4.8\nlog ~10~ copies/mL (4.3--5.4); 72.3% carried viral subtype B (Table 1 ).\n\nTransmitted drug resistance was found in 12.5% of the enrolled subjects\nand declined from 17.3% in 2000--2003 to 10.9% in 2016--2020 ( *p*\n= 0.003) (Figure 1 ). All NNRTIs were fully active in more than 85%,\naccording to GSS: full susceptibility was present in 85.7% for RPV and\nETR, 86.9% for NVP, 89.3% for EFV and 92% for DOR.\n\nPredictors of TDR were viral subtype B \\[vs. non-B, adjusted odds ratio\n(aOR) = 1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.53--2.45, *p* \\< 0.001\\],\nzenith VL (per 1 log ~10~ higher, aOR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76--0.97, *p*\n= 0.013), nadir CD4 count (per 100 cells/μL increase aOR = 0.95, 95% CI:\n0.92--0.99, *p* = 0.013) (Table 1 ).\n\nWe retrieved 28 505 genotypes from 9387 treatment-experienced PLWH\n(67.6% from males and 64.4% from Caucasians) and the median age was\n43 years (IQR: 37--49). Sexual route accounted for 39.9% of the\nmodalities of transmission. Median time since HIV diagnosis was\n136.7 months (65.1--213.1), nadir CD4 count was 154 cells/μL (52--282),\nand CD4 count at genotype was 349.5 cells/μL (192--543). Median zenith\nVL was 5.13 log ~10~ copies/mL (4.50--5.62) and VL at genotype was 3.6\nlog ~10~ copies/mL (4.5--5.6); 80.8% carried viral subtype B (Table 1 ).\n\nAt least one RAM for NNRTIs was detected in 33.2% and any PDR declined\nfrom 43.4% in 2000--2003 to 20.9% in 2016--2020 ( *p* \\< 0.001) (Figure\n1 ). Cumulative GSS \\< 1 was found in 41.2% for NVP, in 39.3% for EFV,\nin 34.7% for RPV, in 34.6% for ETR and in 31.3% for DOR.\n\nPredictors of PDR were sexual transmission route (vs. others,\naOR = 0.779, 95% CI: 0.72--0.85, *p* \\< 0.001), time since HIV diagnosis\n(per 1 month longer, aOR = 1.002, 95% CI: 1.001--1.002, *p* \\< 0.001),\nviral subtype B (vs. non-B, aOR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.19--1.58, *p*\n\\< 0.001), VL (per 1 log ~10~ higher, aOR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.08--1.16,\n*p* \\< 0.001), nadir CD4 count (per 100 cells/μL increase, aOR = 0.91,\n95% CI: 0.88--0.94, *p* \\< 0.001), previous exposure to any NNRTIs\n(aOR = 2.31, 95% CI: 2.14--2.49, *p* \\< 0.001) and a more recent\ncalendar year sequence (any span time \\>2008 vs. 2000--2003, any aOR\n\\<1, *p* \\< 0.001) (Table 1 ).\n\nAmong PLWH with viral subtype non-B HIV-1 infection, resistance was\nfound in 7.8% of naïves and 33.2% of the treatment-experienced\nindividuals. Among non-B ones, the most representative subtypes were\nCRF_02AG (22% of non-B subtype HIV-1 infected naïve subjects, 31% of\nnon-B subtype HIV-1 infected experienced PLWH genotypes), F (19% for\nnaïves and 15% for experienced), CRF01_AE (9% for naïves and 7% for\nexperienced), and C (8% for naïves and 6% for experienced). Each was\nsignificantly associated with a minor rate of mutations among\ntreatment-experienced individuals, while for naïve individuals, only\nCRF01_AE and F were associated with fewer RAMs.\n\nThose PLWH born in Italy were the most represented group among subtypes\nB, F and CRF01_AE, while PLWH from sub-Saharan Africa were prevalent\namong CRF02_AG and C subtypes. NNRTI resistance was higher among\nItalians.\n\nConsidering both naïve and experienced patients, the most represented\nRAMs were E138A, K103N, G190A, V108I, K101E, and Y181C. All these\nmutations were more frequent among individuals carrying viral subtype B\nHIV-1.\n\n::: section\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThe rise of HIV-1 drug resistance to NNRTIs threatens the long-term\nsuccess of antiretroviral therapies \\[ 4 \\]. Susceptibility to NNRTIs in\nour population was in agreement with data reported by WHO \\[ 4 \\]. At\nleast one RAM for NNRTI was detected in 33.2% of the cumulative\ngenotypes from treatment-experienced PLWH and in 12.5% from naïve\nindividuals, highlighting the role of previous exposure to an\nNNRTI-based regimen as a predictor for resistance to the class, which\ncan compromise future therapy strategies because of the long-term\npersistence of NNRTI mutations \\[ 10 \\]. However, both PDR and TDR\nprevalence is declining, as already reported in a European cohort by\nMiranda et al. \\[ 11 \\], probably because of the introduction of other\nclasses as anchor drugs, in particular, integrase strand transfer\ninhibitors (INSTIs) and thanks to the higher efficacy and tolerability\nof later NNRTIs. Only DOR is currently included in recommended initial\nregimens by the European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) Guidelines, while\nEFV and RPV are listed among the alternative regimens \\[ 1 \\]. In fact,\nit has been shown that generally several concomitant mutations are\nrequired to reduce susceptibility to DOR, while for ETR, RPV, EFV, and\nNVP, only two or three NNRTI PDRs/TDRs are enough to reduce the efficacy\nof the compounds. The maintenance of the activity of Doravirine despite\nthe presence of NNRTI mutations such as K103N, V106I and Y181C\ncontributes to the success of DOR-containing regimens \\[ 12 , 13 \\].\n\nRilpivirine has recently acquired new relevance thanks to its use as a\nlong-acting (LA) agent together with cabotegravir. Data from a 7-year\nobservational cohort has shown the long-term durability of RPV because\nof its effectiveness and good tolerability, encouraging its use in this\ninnovative regimen \\[ 14 \\]. The LA formulation has also shown excellent\nresults in terms of virological and patient-reported outcomes, even if\nsome cases with virological failure and newly emerged resistance\nmutations to NNRTIs have been reported \\[ 15 \\].\n\nIn our cohort, a lower nadir CD4 count was a predictor for both TDR and\nPDR. Regarding VL, a lower zenith of HIV-1-RNA was a predictor of TDR,\nprobably due to the lower replication capacity of resistant variants\nover wild-type HIV \\[ 16 \\]. Instead, as regards experienced patients, a\nhigher viral load at sequencing was a predictor of PDR. This could be\nexplained by the fact that genotyping on RNA was performed exclusively\nin cases of virological failure with detectable viraemia. Subtype B was\nalso a predictor for resistance to NNRTIs and it was the most\nrepresented subtype in our cohort, as expected. Prevalent NNRTI\nmutations were E138A, K103N, G190A, V108I, K101E and Y181C. All these\nwere more represented among viral subtype B HIV-1-infected individuals.\nAs regards non-B subtypes, CRF_02AG, F, CRF01_AE and C were the most\nfrequent. Considering naïve PLWH, only CRF01_AE and F were predictors of\nfewer RAMs. Previous studies in the literature confirm a higher\nprevalence of resistance among subtype B HIV-1-infected patients \\[ 17 -\n19 \\]. By contrast, in a Spanish cohort of treatment-naïve patients\nNNRTI resistance was two-fold higher in non-B subtypes, in contrast to\nour study, in particular in CRF02_AG individuals, perhaps explained by\nthe use of an NNRTI-based regimen in the countries of origin of most\nforeign non-B-infected patients in Spain \\[ 20 \\].\n\nThe strengths of the study are the large sample size and the wide\nrepresentation of PLWH in care across Italy, the national\nrepresentativeness of the real-life setting, the enrolment of\nindividuals typically not included in randomized trials due to the\npresence of baseline resistance, and the wide calendar time span\nanalysed.\n\nLimitations include the lack of information on the reasons for NNRTI\ndiscontinuation and the lack of last genotype and adherence data at\nvirological failure.\n\nIn conclusion, in Italy, RAMs to NNRTI circulation declined during the\nlast 20 years. NNRTIs remain pivotal drugs for the management of HIV-1\ndue to safety concerns and long-acting options.\n\n## FUNDING INFORMATION\n\nNo funding was received to perform this study.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 36016383\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be transmitted via parenteral, sexual, or vertical exposure routes. The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals. This retrospective study examines genetic sequences and clinical parameters like CD4+ T cell counts and viral load to understand the epidemiological and genetic characteristics of HIV-1 in the pediatric population in Rio de Janeiro.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 35061671\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Materials and methods\nWe analyzed 1071 HIV-1 pol-gene fragment sequences (2253–3369 bp) from patients who were initiating or reinitiating first-line ART in six EECA counties, i.e., Armenia (n = 120), Azerbaijan (n = 96), Belarus (n = 158), Russia (n = 465), Tajikistan (n = 54), and Uzbekistan (n = 178), between 2017 and 2019. HIV Pretreatment DR (PDR) and drug resistance mutation (DRM) prevalence was estimated using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database. The PDR level was interpreted according to the WHO standard PDR survey protocols. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database and subsequently confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Transmission clusters were determined using Cluster Picker.\nResults\nAnalyses of HIV subtypes showed that EECA, in general, has the same HIV genetic variants of sub-subtype A6, CRF63_02A1, and subtype B, with different frequencies and representation for each country.\nThe prevalence of PDR to any drug class was 2.8% in Uzbekistan, 4.2% in Azerbaijan, 4.5% in Russia, 9.2% in Armenia, 13.9% in Belarus, and 16.7% in Tajikistan. PDR to protease inhibitors (PIs) was not detected in any country. PDR to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) was not detected among patients in Azerbaijan, and was relatively low in other countries, with the highest prevalence in Tajikistan (5.6%). The prevalence of PDR to nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was the lowest in Uzbekistan (2.8%) and reached 11.1% and 11.4% in Tajikistan and Belarus, respectively.\nGenetic transmission network analyses identified 226/1071 (21.1%) linked individuals, forming 93 transmission clusters mainly containing two or three sequences. We found that the time since HIV diagnosis in clustered patients was significantly shorter than that in unclustered patients (1.26 years vs 2.74 years). Additionally, the K103N/S mutation was mainly observed in clustered sequences (6.2% vs 2.8%).\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance and the genetic analysis of HIV-1 sequences from patient samples.

ARV drugs vary in their\nability to control HIV infection, displaying differences in\ntreatment-limiting factors and genetic barriers to resistance. The\ncurrent report assesses the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance\nmutations (DRMs) among patients who failed first-line antiretroviral\ntherapy (ART) and evaluates the genetic barrier of different regimens.\n\n### Methods\n\nThe study cohort ( *n* = 271) included HIV-infected individuals who\nvisited the Novosibirsk, Russia, HIV/AIDS clinic in 2018--2022. All\npatients received first-line ART prior to virological failure.\nSociodemographic and HIV-related data were collected from medical\nrecords and self-reported questionnaires. HIV-1 *pol* gene sequences\nwere generated, and the presence of HIV-1 DRM was assessed. The genetic\nbarrier to resistance was assessed by combining treatment regimen and\nadherence data.\n\n### Results\n\nNonoptimal ART adherence was identified in 48.3% of patients and\ncorrelated with male sex, PWID, unemployment, and rural area residence.\nMost of the patients with high-level adherence were identified among\nthose who were on TDF+3TC+DTG. HIV-1 DRMs were identified in 54.6% of\nthe patients. The analysis of HIV-1 DRM, ART regimen, and adherence data\nclassified TDF+3TC+DTG and TDF+3TC+LPV/r as treatment regimens with a\nhigh genetic barrier, whereas EFV-containing ART was classified as a\nregimen with a low genetic barrier.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThe current study delivers results on the efficacy of HIV-1 ART and\ntreatment adherence in real-world practice settings. This report\nsuggests that ART regimens with a high genetic barrier to resistance\ncombined with improved treatment adherence may reduce the transmission\nof HIV-1 resistant variants.\n\n\n## 2. Methods\n\n### 2.1. Study cohort\n\nThe study cohort included 271 patients who were on first-line ART and\nvisited Novosibirsk Regional AIDS/HIV Clinical Hospital between March\n2018 and August 2022. The age of the patients varied from 21 to 59 years\nold. All patients had undetectable viral load (VL) levels for 3--6\nmonths while taking ART with further virological failure. ART adherence\nwas analysed retrospectively using medical records and self-reported\ndata; high-level adherence was assigned if all the required ART doses\nwere taken; if patient reported sporadic missing doses, the adherence\nlevel was assigned as medium; and if the gap between the treatment doses\nwas seven days or longer, the adherence level was assigned as low. The\nsociodemographic and HIV-related characteristics of the patients were\nalso analysed.\n\n### 2.2. HIV-1 genotyping and subtyping\n\nHIV-1 RNA was isolated from 250 µL of plasma using DeltaMag HBV/HCV/HIV\n(Vector-Best, Russia) according to the kit\\'s manual. Reverse\ntranscription and PCR were performed using RealBest Master Mix RT\n(Vector-Best, Russia) and BioMaster HS-Taq PCR-Color (BioLabMix,\nRussia), respectively, to amplify the HIV-1 PR-RT fragment (1302 bp).\nDNA sequencing was performed using an ABI PRISM 3130xl DNA Analyser\n(Applied Biosystems, USA). HIV-1 sequences were further analysed using\nSequencher 4.1 software (GeneCodesCorporation, Ann Arbor, MI). HIV-1\nsubtypes were identified using maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis\nusing MEGA v.6.0.6 \\[9\\] . The virus subtype was assigned if the study\nsequence formed a monophyletic clade (branch support value ≥90) with\ncorresponding HIV-1 subtype/CRF reference sequence retrieved from the\nLos Alamos National Laboratory HIV Sequence Database \\[10\\] .\n\nHIV-1 study sequences were analysed for the presence of DRM using the\nStanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (HIVdb Program) \\[11\\] . DRM were\nclassified according to the WHO list of mutations \\[12\\] . The genetic\nbarrier to resistance was assessed using the ART regimen and adherence\ndata of the study patients.\n\n### 2.3. Statistical analysis\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using Statistica v.10. The χ ^2^ test\nwas conducted to examine the differences in categorical variables, and\nthe Mann-Whitney *U* test was used to examine differences in median\nvalues of quantitative variables. *P* -values \\<0.05 were considered\nstatistically significant. Spearman\\'s correlation was used to compare\nranked variables.\n\n::: section\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. Study cohort\n\nOut of 271 study patients, 56.4% ( *n* = 153) were men. The median age\nof the patients was 35.4 years old (interquartile range \\[IQR\\]:\n32.6--38.3). Most of the patients (64.8%; *n* = 176) were infected\nthrough heterosexual transmission, 31.5% ( *n* = 85) of the patients\nwere persons who injected drugs (PWID), 0.4% ( *n* = 1), and 3.3% ( *n*\n= 9) were infected through homosexual and unknown transmission modes,\nrespectively. Men were more likely to be PWID than women (50.9% vs.\n25.4%; *P* \\< 0.05).\n\n### 3.2. Analysis of ART adherence\n\nAnalysis of the adherence data identified that almost half (131/271;\n48.3%) of the patients reported missing ART doses. Low-level adherence\nwas identified in 31.7% (83/271) of the study patients, and medium-level\nadherence was identified in 16.6% (45/271) of the study patients. The\ncorrelation of sociodemographic characteristics of the patients and\nadherence data was assessed ( Fig. 1 ). Thus, nonoptimal adherence was\nmore frequent among PWID and those who resided in rural areas (75.3% and\n62.5%, respectively). Men were more likely to have nonoptimal adherence\ncompared to women (54.5% vs. 36.4%; *P* \\< 0.001). Also, unemployed\npatients were more likely to miss ART doses compared to employed\npatients (69.5% vs. 26.3%; *P* \\< 0.05). High-level adherence was more\nfrequent in women (63.6%), employed individuals (73.7%), patients with\nheterosexual transmission (67.6%), and urban residents (65.9%; *P* \\<\n0.05).\n\nAdditionally, the correlation between treatment regimen and ART\nadherence was evaluated ( Fig. 2 ). Most patients (37.6%) received\ntenofovir (TDF) + lamivudine (3TC) + efavirenz (EFV) as a first-line ART\nregimen. Out of those patients, 40.2% had a high level of adherence; the\nremaining 16.7% and 43.1% had medium and low levels of adherence,\nrespectively. Out of the patients (21.7%) on abacavir (ABC) 600\nmg + 3TC + EFV, 45.7% reported high adherence, 16.9% reported medium\nadherence, and 37.4% reported low adherence. Almost one-fifth (17.7%) of\nthe study patients were on a TDF + 3TC + dolutegravir (DTG) regimen.\nAmong those patients, high-level adherence was identified in 85.4%; the\nremaining 8.3% and 6.3% of study patients reported medium- and low-level\nadherence, respectively. A ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r)-based\nregimen was received by 15.1% of the study patients; of those, 31.7%\nreported high adherence, 29.3% reported medium adherence, and 39%\nreported low adherence. Among the study patients, 5.5% were on\nTDF + 3TC + elsulfavirine (ESV). Of those, 80% reported high adherence,\n13.3% reported medium adherence, and the remaining 6.7% reported low\nadherence. Alternative first-line ART regimens (TDF + 3TC + raltegravir\n\\[RAL\\], TDF + 3TC + datunavir (DRV/r), phosphoside\n\\[PhAZT\\] + 3TC + RAL) were prescribed to 2.4% of study patients who\nreported high-level adherence. Patients on TDF + 3TC + DTG were more\nlikely to report high-level adherence than those who were on either\nTDF + 3TC + EFV or TDF + 3TC + LPV/r (85.4% vs. 42.1% or 31.7%, *P* \\<\n0.001).\n\n### 3.3. ARV drug resistance mutations\n\nHIV-1 DRMs were detected in 54.6% (148/271) of the study patients with\nvirological failure (Supplementary File S1.A). Most (60.1%) of those\npatients had DRM to both NRTI + NNRTI . Mutations conferring resistance\nto either NRTI or NNRTI were detected in 15.5% and 12.2% of patients,\nrespectively. DRM to NRTI + PI and NNRTI + PI were detected in 4.1% and\n1.4% of the patients, respectively; mutations conferring resistance to\nNRTI + INSTI were identified in 2%. Mutations to three ARV drug classes\nwere also identified. Thus, mutations conferring resistance to\nNRTI + NNRTI + PI and NRTI + NNRTI + INSTI were detected in 2.7% and\n1.4% of patients, respectively. One patient (0.6%) had only a single\ndrug resistance mutation to INSTI. One patient had a combination of four\nmutations (E138K, G140A, S147G, and Q148K) conferring resistance to\nINSTI. Detailed data on DRM are shown in Supplementary File S1.B. Among\nthe patients receiving ESV-based ART ( *n* = 15), only one patient\nacquired resistance to NRTI (M184V) and NNRTI (K103N, V106I, Y181C,\nH221Y). This patient reported low-level treatment adherence.\n\nOut of 237 study patients, the following HIV-1 genetic variants were\nidentified: CRF63_02A was detected in 81.9% of the patients, sub-subtype\nA6 in 14.7%, CRF02_AG in 1.7%, subtype B in 1.3%, and CRF03_A6B in 0.4%.\nARV drug resistance mutations were more frequent in CRF63_02A6 (62.4%,\n*P* \\< 0.001). It is important to note that mutations conferring\nresistance to PI and INSTI were identified only among patients who had\nCRF63_02A6 HIV-1 infection.\n\n### 3.4. Genetic barrier to resistance\n\nThe correlation of ART regimen and virological failure as well as the\ncorrelation of drug resistance presence and ART adherence were analysed.\nThus, ABC + 3TC + EFV and TDF + 3TC + EFV were classified as ART\nregimens with a low genetic barrier, whereas TDF + 3TC + DTG and\nTDF + 3TC + LPV/r were classified as ART regimens with a high genetic\nbarrier.\n\n#### 3.4.1. ABC + 3TC + EFV\n\nOut of 59 patients who received ABC + 3TC + EFV, 50 (84.7%) had DRM\ndetected. More than half (64%; 32/50) of the patients who had DRM\nreported nonoptimal adherence. The remaining nine patients with no DRM\nreported high-level adherence. The lowest susceptibility was identified\nfor ABC and 3TC, mostly due to the presence of the M184V/I resistance\nmutation ( Fig. 3 A). A high to intermediate level of cross-resistance\nto TDF was identified in 6.8% of patients; intermediate cross-resistance\nto AZT was identified in 1.7% of patients. A high to intermediate level\nof cross-resistance to ETV and DOR was identified in 3.4% and 6.8% of\npatients, respectively.\n\n#### 3.4.2. TDF + 3TC + EFV\n\nDRMs were detected in 78.4% (80/102) of patients who received\nTDF + 3TC + EFV ( Fig. 3 B). The majority (70%) of those patients\nreported nonoptimal treatment adherence, whereas the remaining 30% of\nthe patients reported high adherence to ART. Out of the 21.6% (22/102)\npatients with no DRM, nonoptimal ART adherence was identified in 90.9%\nof patients. High-level resistance to 3TC and ABC was detected in 59.8%\nof patients. High-level resistance to TDF was identified in 25.3% of the\npatients; this rate was significantly higher than among patients who\nreceived ABC + 3TC + EFV ( *P* \\< 0.05). A high level of\ncross-resistance to ABC was detected in 3.9% of patients. High-level\nresistance to EFV and NVP was less frequent among patients who received\nTDF + 3TC + EFV than among those who were on ABC + 3TC + EFV (25.4% vs.\n38.9%, *P* \\< 0.05). A high to intermediate level of cross-resistance to\nETR, DOR, and RPV was detected in 2.8%, 2.8%, and 1.9%, respectively.\nResistance mutations to PI and INSTI were not detected among this\nsubgroup of patients.\n\n#### 3.4.3. TDF + 3TC + DTG\n\nDRMs were identified among 16.7% (8/48) of patients who received\nTDF + 3TC + DTG ( Fig. 3 C). The prevalence of DRM in this subgroup was\nsignificantly lower than those who received ABC + 3TC + EFV or\nTDF + 3TC + EFV ( *P* \\< 0.05). Out of the patients who had DRM, 87.5%\n(7/8) reported nonoptimal ART adherence. The remaining patient (woman,\n41 years old) had high-level treatment adherence; further examination\nrevealed that she had gastric ulcers and chronic pancreatitis , which\ncould lead to ineffective absorption of the ARV drugs. High ART\nadherence was registered in all 40 patients with no DRM.\n\nDRMs to INSTI were detected in four patients in this subgroup. One (man,\n50 years old) of those patients had a combination of four mutations\n(E138K, G140A, S147G, and Q148K) that confer high-level to intermediate\nresistance to all INSTIs. This patient had suboptimal ART adherence and\nreported drug and alcohol use; multiple prolonged (for over a month) ART\ntermination episodes were registered. DRMs to TDF, 3TC, and ABC were\ndetected in less than 5% of the patients in this subgroup. Resistance to\nAZT was not identified.\n\n#### 3.4.4. TDF + 3TC + LPV/r\n\nThe subgroup who received TDF + 3TC + LPV/r as a first-line ART included\n41 patients; DRMs to ARV drugs were identified in 9.8% (4/41) of\npatients, which is significantly lower ( *P* \\< 0.05) than among\npatients who were on ABC + 3TC + EFV and TDF + 3TC + EFV ( Fig. 3 D).\nAll four patients with DRMs reported low adherence to ART. Out of the 37\npatients with no DRMs, nonoptimal adherence was identified in 64.8%; the\nremaining 35.2% of the patients reported high adherence.\n\n::: section\n\n## 4. Conclusions\n\nIn the Novosibirsk region, as well as in other regions of Russia, an\nincreasing prevalence of HIV-1 acquired drug resistance most likely\noccurs in tandem with expanded ART coverage. A high frequency of\nresistance mutations to NRTI and NNRTI has been identified; those ARV\ndrugs are mostly used as components of first-line treatment regimens.\nThus, such NRTIs as ABC , 3TC , TDF, and AZT are backbones in the\nmajority of treatment regimens. Moreover, genetic barriers to resistance\nand ART adherence also play a significant role in resistance\ndevelopment. Genetic barriers to resistance are characterized by the\npharmacokinetic properties of the drug, as well as by drug-to-drug\ninteractions and bioavailability \\[13\\] . PIs and INSTIs have a high\ngenetic barrier to resistance, whereas widely used NRTIs and NNRTIs have\na low genetic barrier \\[7\\] .\n\nOptimal ART adherence plays a pivotal role in the efficacy of anti-HIV-1\ntherapy, and many factors have been found to affect adherence, such as\ntransmission route, sex, employment status, residence area, and\nART-associated side effects \\[14\\] . In the current study, patients with\nlow-level adherence to TDF + 3TC + EFV (43.1%) and TDF + 3TC + LPV/r\n(39%) reported drug-associated side effects more frequently compared\nwith patients on other regimens. Additionally, the current analysis\nrevealed that the majority of patients who had DRMs detected had\nCRF63_02A6 HIV-infection. CRF63_02A6 is characterized by higher mutation\nand replication rates compared with other HIV-1 genetic variants\nidentified in the Novosibirsk region.\n\nIn total, 54.6% of the study patients who experienced virological\nfailure had HIV-1-bearing DRMs. Mutations conferring resistance to NTRIs\nand NNRTIs were more frequent. This study revealed that widely used ART\nregimens had different levels of genetic barriers. Thus,\nTDF + 3TC + LPV/r and TDF + 3TC + LPV/r had higher genetic barriers\ncompared with ABC + 3TC + EFV and TDF + 3TC + EFV. The study identified\nthat PWID, rural area residence, male sex, and unemployment status were\nmajor predictors for nonoptimal ART adherence. The findings of this\nreport highlight the required complex analysis of potential risk factors\nfor insufficient adherence prior to prescription of particular ART\nregimen. Patients with predicted low-level adherence should be\nprescribed with high genetic barrier to resistance regimens, such as\nthose based on DTG , DRV, ETR, and DOR. Also, since a majority of study\npatients with DRM had CRF63_02A6 HIV-infection, on-demand HIV-1\nresistance testing with virological failure while being on ART is\nrequired. Primary drug resistance testing is also required for patients\nwho have suboptimal ART adherence risk factors.\n\nThis report represents the current real-world evidence of the\neffectiveness of HIV-1 antiretroviral drug treatment and therapy\nadherence in a heterogeneous population in clinical practice. This study\nwill be especially beneficial for clinicians, healthcare\ndecision-makers, and patients on how medical intervention of HIV-1\ntreatment performs.\n\n**Funding:** This study was supported by the State Research and\nDevelopment Program #6-21 State Research Center of Virology and\nBiotechnology 'Vector' .\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 34835480\nQuestion ID: 16\nQuestion: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: The majority of patients (47.1%) were on first-line regimen AZT + 3TC + NVP or EFV, and only 17.6% of the patients received a DTG-containing regimen, an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI).

Our recent randomized\nclinical trial comparing a switch to dolutegravir monotherapy with\ncontinuation of cART in early-treated individuals demonstrated sustained\nvirological suppression over 48 weeks. Here, we characterize the\nlongitudinal landscape of the HIV-1 reservoir in these participants,\nwith particular attention to potential differences between treatment\ngroups regarding evidence of evolution as a proxy for low-level\nreplication. Near full-length HIV-1 proviral polymerase chain reaction\nand next-generation sequencing was applied to longitudinal peripheral\nblood mononuclear cell samples to assess proviral evolution and the\npotential emergence of drug resistance mutations (DRMs). Neither an\nincrease in genetic distance nor diversity over time was detected in\nparticipants of both treatment groups. Single proviral analysis showed\nhigh proportions of defective proviruses and low DRM numbers. No\nevidence for evolution during dolutegravir monotherapy was found in\nthese early-treated individuals.\n\n\n## METHODS\n\n### ESS and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Samples\n\nThe ESS ( NCT00537966 ) enrolled 101 people with HIV (PWH) from the\nZurich Primary HIV Infection Study and Swiss HIV Cohort Study.

From 5 million PBMCs, an estimated input of 10--420 infected\ncell equivalents for bulk proviral sequencing and 3--120 infected cell\nequivalents for quantitative PCR was used. Abbreviations: ART,\nantiretroviral therapy; cART, combination antiretroviral therapy; DTG,\ndolutegravir; ESS wk0, Early Simplified Study week 0; ESS wk48, Early\nSimplified Study week 48; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1;\nNGS, next-generation sequencing; PBMCs, peripheral blood mononuclear\ncells; qPCR, quantitative polymerase chain reaction.\n\n### DNA and RNA Isolation, Complementary DNA Synthesis, and HIV-1 Quantification\n\nDNA and RNA was simultaneously isolated from 5 million PBMCs using\nAllPrep Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions\nfollowed by complementary DNA synthesis. Quantification of HIV-1\nunspliced RNA, HIV-1 multiply spliced RNA, and HIV-1 2-LTR circles was\nperformed as previously described \\[ 35 \\] ( Supplementary Appendix 1 ).\n\n### Near Full-Length HIV-1 Proviral Polymerase Chain Reaction and Next-Generation Sequencing\n\nNear full-length HIV-1 proviral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was\nperformed as previously published \\[ 36 \\] with 2 additional approaches\nusing the same experimental conditions to increase amplification\nsuccess: approach 2 (a first and second hemi-length PCR amplifying a 5′\nand a 3′ amplicon) and approach 3 (a first and second nested near\nfull-length PCR) ( Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Table 1 ). For\neach sample, the PCR approach with a positive result was used for\nnext-generation sequencing (NGS). DNA isolation, PCR, and NGS for\nparticipants' different time points were performed stricktly separately,\nas a precaution to avoid contamination.\n\n### Single HIV-1 Genome Dilution and Amplification\n\nIndividuals for single HIV-1 genome analysis were selected (\nSupplementary Appendix 2 ) and DNA was isolated from 5 million cells,\nusing the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen), according to the\nmanufacturer\\'s instructions. DNA was diluted to single provirus\naccording to droplet digital PCR results \\[ 26 \\] and Poisson\ndistribution, and whole genome amplification was performed using the\nREPLIg Midi Kit (100) (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer\\'s\ninstructions. Each well with amplified DNA was subjected to PCR, and\nHIV-1 PCR-positive wells were sequenced as described above.\n\n### NGS Analysis\n\nAll subsequent analysis, if not otherwise specified, was performed using\nR version 4.0.4 software. Logistic mixed-effects models were used to\nassess influence of different factors on NGS success. Majority consensus\nsequences assembly from NGS reads was done with SmaltAlign \\[ 37 \\].\nSmaltAlign consists of an initial de novo alignment followed by mapping\nto the HIV-1 reference sequence HXB2 (GenBank accession number K03455 \\[\n38 \\]). Sample quality was checked for \\>40% completeness with \\>100\nreads coverage. For single proviruses, hypermutated sequences were\ndetected using the hypermut 2.0 online tool \\[ 39 \\], whereas for bulk\nsequences the hypermut 2.0 tool \\[ 39 \\] was adapted to the individual\nNGS read level ( Supplementary Appendix 3 ). Alignments were created\nusing MUSCLE (v.3.8.31_i86darwin32) \\[ 40 \\], and phylogenetic trees\nwere constructed using FastTree \\[ 41 \\] as previously described \\[ 42\n\\]. Genetic distance was calculated for pairwise sequence overlaps \\>100\nbp length using the T92 model. Average pairwise diversity was calculated\nas previously described \\[ 33 \\] and additionally extended to *env* .\nFor single proviruses, intactness was assessed with the Proviral\nSequence Annotation and Intactness Test (ProSeq-IT) tool \\[ 43 \\]. DRMs\nwere detected with MinVar \\[ 44 \\] using a frequency threshold of 2% and\nfurther filtered for relevant mutations ( Supplementary Appendix 4 ,\nSupplementary Table 2 ). Statistical analysis was performed using paired\n(within treatment groups) or unpaired (between treatment groups)\nWilcoxon test with .05 significance threshold.\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Study Design and Near Full-Length HIV-1 Proviral PCR and NGS\n\nPCR and NGS for bulk sequences was performed for the 3 time points of\nthe 101 individuals participating in the ESS, resulting in a total of\n297 NGS sequences ( Figure 1 ). After quality-based sample selection, a\nconsensus sequence was obtained for 71% (210/297) of samples despite the\nsmall reservoir size of the ESS participants, which was shown to be\napproximately 1 log ~10~ lower when compared to chronically infected\nindividuals \\[ 30 \\]. One hundred sixty-three NGS sequences from 43\nparticipants (25 on DTG monotherapy and 18 on cART) were selected, as\nall of these 43 had 3 time points with successful consensus sequences\n(1yaas, ESS wk0, ESS wk48), and 34 of those also had a sequence from the\nART start time point ( Supplementary Figure 2 ). Logistic regression\nrevealed that sequencing success depends on reservoir size, DNA\nconcentration after nucleic acid isolation, and DNA concentration after\nPCR ( Supplementary Figure 3 ).\n\n### No Increased Genetic Distance in the DTG Monotherapy Versus the cART Group\n\nHypermutations in the provirus induced by the host enzyme APOBEC\n(APOBEC3G/F) frequently occur and can potentially be misinterpreted as\nsigns of proviral evolution, and were therefore excluded from our bulk\nsequences. Reads above our defined strict hypermutation threshold were\ndetected in all samples ( Supplementary Figure 4 ). To investigate\nclustering of participants and possible viral evolution,\nmaximum-likelihood phylogenetic and pairwise genetic distance analyses\nwere performed on these APOBEC filtered sequences. Phylogenies showed\nclose clustering of participants with exception of individual 336 at\nweek 0 (see Supplementary Appendix 5 ) and no signs of viral evolution\nover the course of the ESS period (ESS wk0 to ESS wk48) and no\ndifference between the 2 treatment groups through visual inspection (\nFigure 2  * ​ A A * and ​ and2 2  * ​ B B * ). Due to filtering out\nhypermutated reads, genetic distance could only be calculated for 35 of\n43 participants for the ESS period. The median pairwise genetic distance\nof proviral sequences within each individual over the ESS period was\n0.5% (interquartile range \\[IQR\\], 0.06%--1.5%) with no significant\ndifference between the 2 treatment groups (0.3% \\[IQR, 0.05%--1.5%\\] for\nDTG monotherapy and 0.8% \\[IQR, 0.18%--1.5%\\] for cART; Wilcoxon test\n*P* = .56). Furthermore, genetic distance within each individual before\n(1yaas--ESS wk0) and after (1yaas--ESS wk48) DTG monotherapy did not\nsignificantly change in either treatment group (DTG monotherapy: *P* =\n1, cART: *P* = .265; Figure 2  * ​ C C * ). Interestingly, overall median\npairwise genetic distance was significantly higher with 1.5% (IQR,\n0.32%--2.8%) in non-APOBEC-filtered sequences compared to\nAPOBEC-filtered sequences ( *P* \\< .001, Figure 2  * ​ C C * ).\nFurthermore, genetic distance does not correlate with number of days\nbetween 1yaas and ESS wk48 ( *P* = .48), reinforcing that genetic\ndistance does not increase over time ( Figure 2  * ​ D D * ). Viral blips\ndid not have an effect on genetic distance and were not found more\nfrequently in the DTG monotherapy ( *P* = 1) ( Supplementary Figure 5 ).\nFurthermore, different HIV-1 RNA and DNA forms that arise during HIV-1\ntranscription were measured for all 101 participants for time points\n1yaas, ESS wk0, and ESS wk48. No unspliced RNA, multiply spliced RNA or\n2-LTR circles were detected, with no differences between the DTG\nmonotherapy and the cART group ( Supplementary Figure 6 ).\n\nFigure 2.\n\nPhylogenetic and distance analysis of near full-length HIV-1 proviral\nsequences of 43 early-treated individuals over 4 time points. *A* and\n*B* , Unrooted phylogenetic tree of proviral bulk consensus sequences of\nparticipants in the dolutegravir (DTG) monotherapy (n = 25, *A* ) or\ncombination antiretroviral therapy (cART) (n = 18, *B* ) treatment\ngroup. For individual 190, Early Simplified Study (ESS) week 48, no\nconsensus sequence was obtained after APOBEC filtering. Proviral\nsequences of the different time points (ART start \\[as\\], 1 year after\nART start \\[1yaas\\], ESS week 0 \\[wk0\\], and ESS week 48 \\[wk48\\]) are\nlabeled accordingly. Sequences of the same individual are shown in the\nsame color, and HIV-1 subtype references are shown in black. *C* ,\nPairwise genetic distance between the sequences of 3 time points (1yaas,\nESS wk0, and ESS wk48) for each individual for DTG monotherapy (orange)\nand cART (gray) for APOBEC-filtered (left) and not filtered (right)\nsequences. For hypermutated reads filtered out: wk0--wk48: n = 35,\n1yaas--wk0: n = 40, 1yaas--wk48: n=39; for hypermutated reads not\nfiltered out: wk0--wk48: n = 38, 1yaas--wk0: n = 41, 1yaas--wk48: n =\n41. Unpaired Wilcoxon test was performed to compare treatment groups and\ndistance over time. *D* , Correlation plot between pairwise distance and\nnumber of days between the time point 1yaas and ESS wk48 for 23 DTG\nmonotherapy--treated participants. Gray area represents 95% confidence\ninterval.\n\n### Viral Diversity in DTG Monotherapy Group Does Not Increase Over ESS Period\n\nAverage pairwise diversity was calculated and longitudinally assessed\nfor the 3 main genomic regions, for 139 (85%) samples for *gag* , 147\n(90%) for *pol* , and 123 (75%) for *env* , as other samples contained\ndeletions in the respective genes. Diversity decreased slightly after\nfiltering for APOBEC-induced hypermutations ( Figure 3  * ​ A A * ,\nSupplementary Figure 7 ). At ESS wk48, median average pairwise diversity\nfor participants on DTG monotherapy and cART, respectively, was 0.06%\nand 0.006% for *gag* , 0.02% and 0.09% for *pol* , and 0.005% and 0% for\n*env* , with no significant differences between the treatment groups in\neither gene ( *gag P* = .13, *pol P* = .34, *env P* = .32) ( Figure 3  *\n​A A * ). Longitudinal diversity was variable between participants;\nhowever, mean diversity in participants on DTG monotherapy did not\nincrease over the study period in *gag* , *pol* , or *env* ( *gag* :\n0.04% at ESS wk0, 0.06% at ESS wk48, *P* = .67; *pol* : 0.05% at ESS\nwk0, 0.02% at ESS wk48, *P* = .42; *env* : 0.01% at ESS wk0, 0.005% at\nESS wk48, *P* = .56) and was similar to diversity in participants on\ncART ( *gag* : 0.10% at ESS wk0, 0.006% at ESS wk48, *P* = .16; *pol* :\n0.05% at ESS wk0, 0.09% at ESS wk48, *P* = .69; *env* : 0.01% at ESS\nwk0, 0% at ESS wk48, *P* = .08) ( Figure 3  * ​ A A * , Supplementary\nTable 3 ). Median slope of the diversity before and during study period\nwas zero in both treatment groups ( Figure 3  * ​ B B * ).\n\nFigure 3.\n\nAverage pairwise diversity of near full-length HIV-1 proviral sequences\nof 43 early-treated individuals over the observation period after APOBEC\nfiltering. *A* , Average pairwise diversity within *gag* (n = 139),\n*pol* (n = 147), and *env* (n = 123) after APOBEC filtering for distinct\nparticipants on dolutegravir (DTG) monotherapy (orange) and combination\nantiretroviral therapy (cART; gray) (dots); median with interquartile\nrange (line and bars) is shown. Wilcoxon tests were performed. *B* ,\nSlope of diversity before study, ie, from 1 year after ART start (as) to\nEarly Simplified Study week 0 (1yaas--wk0) (blue) and during the study,\nie, from ESS week 0 to ESS week 48 (wk0--wk48) for DTG monotherapy\n(orange) and cART (gray) participants' sequences after APOBEC filtering.\nSlopes for all 3 genes are shown in the same graph. Median slope before\nstudy (dotted) and during study (dashed) is shown with a vertical line.\n\n### Absence of Detection of Concerning DRMs After APOBEC Filtering\n\nDRM detection was done with MinVar \\[ 44 \\] using a frequency threshold\nof 2% to detect minor variants, as opposed to the usually accepted\nclinically relevant threshold of 15% \\[ 45 \\]. Transmitted DRMs were\npresent in 19% (n = 8) of all 43 participants as detected by Sanger\nsequencing in genotypic resistance test from initial plasma before\nundergoing cART. All transmitted DRMs were detected with proviral NGS as\nwell, and APOBEC filtering did not influence detection frequency (\nSupplementary Figure 8 ). Four DRMs (E138K, G140R, G140S, and R263K)\nwere detected for the first time at ESS wk48 in 5 participants (4 cART\nand 1 DTG monotherapy) ( Supplementary Figure 9 ). However, all 4\ndetected DRMs are APOBEC signature mutations and were no longer detected\nafter APOBEC filtering ( Figure 4 ). However, APOBEC-filtered DRM\ndetection showed 1 emerging DRM (G140R) at ESS wk48 at 100% in DTG\nmonotherapy individual 302 ( Figure 4  * ​ A A * ). According to the\nStanford database, G140R has not been found in people receiving DTG. In\ngeneral, over the ESS period, between 0 and 3 DRMs were found per\nsample. No rise in the median number of DRMs per sample was detected in\neither treatment group, and there were no significant differences\nbetween the treatment groups at ESS wk48 (unpaired Wilcoxon test:\nreverse transcriptase \\[RT\\] *P* = .18, integrase *P* = .407) ( Figure 4\n* ​ B B * ). The highest number of DRMs was detected in RT with a median\nof 1 and 0 DRMs per sample for DTG monotherapy and cART, respectively,\nwhereas in integrase and protease a median of 0 DRM was observed.\n\nFigure 4.\n\nDrug resistance mutations (DRMs) in 43 individuals after APOBEC\nfiltering. *A* , Frequency of each detected DRM over the 4 time points\nfor each dolutegravir (DTG) monotherapy (orange) and combination\nantiretroviral therapy (gray) individual with a detection threshold of\n2%.

Time points with\nno information about frequency of DRMs have no point but a connecting\nline to the next time point. *B* , Total number of DRMs per gene and\ntreatment group for Early Simplified Study (ESS) week 0 and ESS week 48.\nDepicted are individual numbers and boxplots with median and standard\ndeviation.

Individuals were selected based on bulk NGS success and\nhigh reservoir size to optimize single sequencing success and showed\nsimilar characteristics ( Supplementary Figure 10 ). One hundred\nsixty-nine single proviruses were obtained, evenly distributed over\ntreatment groups and time points with a mean of 8 single proviruses per\nindividual per time point ( Supplementary Figures 10 and 11 ).\nPhylogenetic analysis showed clustering of sequences within each\nindividual and no clear pattern of sequence evolution ( Figure 5 ).\nInterestingly, 1 sequence from individual 503 clustered closest together\nwith 3 sequences from individual 353 (box in Figure 5 ). These 4\nsequences form a cluster of extremely hypermutated sequences with\n46%--49% A base composition as compared to the other hypermutated\nsequences with 38%--40% A content, suggesting that the phylogenetic\nclustering was caused by hypermutation resulting in similar mutational\npatterns. Although careful precautions were taken to avoid\ncontamination, contamination of individual 503\\'s sample cannot be ruled\nout.\n\nFigure 5.\n\nMaximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of single proviruses for 10\nparticipants. *A* and *B* , Unrooted phylogenetic tree of single\nproviruses from participants on dolutegravir monotherapy (n = 5, *A* )\nor combination antiretroviral therapy (n = 5, *B* ). Single proviruses\nof Early Simplified Study (ESS) week 0 are shown with squares and ESS\nweek 48 with triangles. All sequences of the same individual are shown\nin the same color. Cluster of extremely hypermutated sequences is shown\nin the brown box.\n\n### Single Proviruses Carry DRMs Only on Defective Sequences\n\nAs participants are on DTG monotherapy, DRM detection in single\nproviruses was focused on integrase. The integrase DRMs E138K, G140S,\nR263K, and E138K/G140S combination were found on 11 of 169 (7%) single\nproviruses, with no significant differences in DRM numbers between the\ntreatment groups at ESS wk48 ( *P* = .16) ( Figure 6  * ​ A A * ). The\ndetected mutations confer potential low-level or intermediate resistance\nagainst DTG; however, they were exclusively found on defective single\nproviruses. All of these 11 single proviruses were defective through\nhypermutations, suggesting that the found DRMs could have been created\nthrough APOBEC rather than selective pressure from ART.\n\nFigure 6.\n\nSingle provirus analysis of 10 participants. *A* , Single proviruses\nwith individual drug resistance mutation (DRM) pattern in integrase (IN)\nis shown for each found variant for the 5 dolutegravir (DTG) monotherapy\n(left, orange) and 5 combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) (right,\ngray) participants at Early Simplified Study (ESS) week 0 (wk0) and ESS\nweek 48 (wk48). DRMs are shown color-coded on the sequence. Relative and\nabsolute numbers of single proviruses on which the mutation was found\nare shown on the right of the sequence. Integrase is depicted\nschematically at the bottom with the numbers indicating the position of\nthe found DRMs. *B* , Proviral landscape of 169 single proviruses for\nparticipants treated with DTG monotherapy (top) and cART (bottom). ESS\nwk0 is shown on the left (DTG monotherapy n = 35, cART n = 45) and ESS\nwk48 on the right (DTG monotherapy n = 45, cART n = 44). Shown are\npercentages of single proviruses with intact, hypermutated, hypermutated\nand large deletion (\\>2000 bp), large deletion, Ψ packaging and major\nsplice donor (MSD) defects, Ψ packaging signal defects, and medium\ndeletions (100--2000 bp) and small deletions (\\<100 bp) in the genome.\n\nLandscape analysis revealed 4% (7/169) of total single proviruses were\nintact with 0%--4% in the DTG monotherapy group and 4%--7% in the cART\ngroup ( Figure 6  * ​ B B * ). Large internal deletions, deletions in the\npackaging signal, and hypermutations were most common defects. Large\ninternal deletions were found at ESS wk0 and ESS wk48 with similar\nfrequencies in the DTG monotherapy group (17% \\[95% confidence interval\n{CI}, 5%--29%\\] and 27% \\[95% CI, 14%--40%\\], respectively) and cART\ngroup (31% \\[95% CI, 17%--45%\\] and 45% \\[95% CI, 30%--60%\\],\nrespectively), whereas hypermutations were found less frequently (DTG\nmonotherapy: 14% \\[95% CI, 3%--25%\\] and 33% \\[95% CI, 19%--47%\\]; cART:\n11% \\[95% CI, 2%--20%\\] and 11% \\[95% CI, 2%--20%\\]) but were also\nsimilarly distributed between treatment groups and time points. Varying\nproportions (2%--23%) of single proviruses with large internal deletions\nwere additionally also hypermutated. Off note, hypermutated sequences\nwere found in all 10 participants except for individual 34 (cART).\nInterestingly, at ESS wk0, in both treatment groups a large proportion\nof single proviruses had defects in the packaging signal that declined\nin the DTG monotherapy group from 43% (95% CI, 27%--59%) to 24% (95% CI,\n12%--36%; *P* = .13) and in the cART group from 49% (95% CI, 34%--64%)\nto 14% (95% CI, 4%--24%; *P* = .0008) at ESS wk48 ( Figure 6  * ​ B B *\n).\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nUnderstanding HIV-1 reservoir dynamics in PWH undergoing ART\nsimplification will be an important aspect for further clinical\ntreatment strategies and HIV reservoir studies. We performed an analysis\nof the HIV-1 reservoir over a period of 48 weeks in early-treated\nparticipants on successful DTG monotherapy. Overall, no low-level\nreplication, sequence evolution, or emergence of concerning DRMs was\ndetected in 43 participants from the ESS within 1 year of treatment\nsimplification. If replication were to occur under monotherapy, we would\nexpect genetic distances and diversity to increase over the course of\nDTG monotherapy. However, we showed that distance and diversity do not\nincrease during DTG monotherapy, are almost identical to the diversity\nand distance before ESS start, and are similar in individuals on DTG\nmonotherapy and those on cART. The low intra-sequence diversity observed\nin our study is in line with another study that observed 1.5% average\npairwise difference in cell-associated DNA from PBMCs of participants on\nsuppressive ART \\[ 46 \\]. In addition, we showed no detection of\ntranscriptional HIV-1 RNA forms in either of our treatment groups;\nhowever, very low numbers of transcripts might have been missed because\nour assay was not highly sensitive or because of the inherent difficulty\nof detecting a rare event. Additionally, we previously showed profound\ndepletion of viral RNA in early-treated participants \\[ 30 \\], possibly\nexplaining the absence of viral RNA that was found in the current study.\nLandscape analysis showed no apparent differences between DTG\nmonotherapy and cART groups, as the fraction of intact and hypermutated\nsequences was comparable. Overall, we found 4% intact single proviruses,\nwhich is in line with previous findings ranging between 2% and 12% \\[ 16\n, 17 , 47 \\]. DRM detection showed that most DRMs are APOBEC signature\nmutations and either appear on hypermutated single proviruses or are\nremoved after APOBEC filtering, indicating that drug pressure probably\nplays a minor role in developing these mutations. Bulk DRM analysis\nrevealed emergence of G140R in 1 DTG monotherapy--treated individual.\nG140R is a revertant mutation from the original G140S/A/C but only\nconfers intermediate DTG resistance when in combination with Q148H/R/K,\nwhich was not found in this individual. Furthermore, this individual did\nnot show viral failure on DTG monotherapy over an additional 3 years;\nthus, this mutation was most likely not selected by DTG monotherapy \\[\n28 \\]. In contrast, 3 other clinical trials investigated DTG monotherapy\nin individuals mostly treated during the chronic stage of infection.\nThey showed 17 of 204 individuals with viral failure, 6 of which\ndeveloped DRMs, most commonly N155H, which was not detected in any of\nour participants \\[ 23--25 \\]. Early ART start, leading to smaller\nreservoir size, seems to be a key factor in the success of DTG\nmonotherapy \\[ 26 , 28 \\], as also assessed in a meta-analysis \\[ 32 \\].\n\nAPOBEC-induced hypermutations increase diversity and genetic distances\nand result in nonsense DRMs; thus, filtering out APOBEC-hypermutated\nreads is a necessary step. In contrast to HIV-1 RNA genomes, proviruses\ncan contain large numbers of APOBEC-induced hypermutations, many being\nkey DRMs, which complicates DRM detection in proviral sequences \\[ 48\n\\]. Before APOBEC filtering, we found a larger number of DRMs over all\ntime points in protease, RT, and integrase. After APOBEC filtering,\nseveral DRMs were not detected anymore, especially M184I (nucleotide\nreverse transcriptase inhibitor), a classic APOBEC target site. This is\nin line with a recent study which suggested that DRMs found in proviral\nsequences are mostly due to hypermutations and that real DRMs are only\nrevealed after hypermutated proviral sequences are removed \\[ 49 \\].\nCareful removal of hypermutated reads or positions from sequencing data\nis therefore of great importance for accurate sequence analysis and\ninterpretation. In the absence of more sophisticated tools to remove\nhypermutations from bulk proviral NGS data, our analysis used a\nstringent threshold, aiming for a high sensitivity with the cost of low\nspecificity, for APOBEC filtering; therefore, almost 70% of reads were\nclassified as hypermutated. This is in contrast to single-genome\nstudies, in which approximately 30% of sequences are considered\nhypermutated \\[ 47 \\]. However, classification of short NGS reads from\nbulk sequencing as opposed to near full-length single genomes tends to\nbe more difficult and uncertain. Development of adequate tools to detect\nand remove hypermutated reads with high certainty from bulk proviral NGS\ndata is therefore urgently needed.\n\nFiltering for APOBEC-induced hypermutations in bulk sequences with our\ndeveloped method has a low specificity, thus limiting our analysis;\nhowever, tools addressing hypermutation filtering from proviral data are\nnot yet available.\n\nOur study has strength and limitations. Strengths are that we studied\nthe HIV-1 reservoir in well-characterized participants from an RCT with\nhighly sensitive methods. Limitations are the limited number of PBMCs\nwith a low infection frequency available for analysis as well as limited\nsequencing success, probably due to the small reservoir size of\nearly-treated individuals that compromises sequencing endeavors and\nsensitivity of RNA assays. Nevertheless, this study includes almost half\nof all study participants and sequencing success was proportionally\nsimilar between treatment groups. In addition, our analysis was limited\nto PBMCs. However, this compartment is the only one that can\nlongitudinally be accessed in a larger number of individuals within a\nclinical trial.\n\nAltogether, our data reveal absence of detectable sequence changes,\nrespective of viral evolution, suggestive of ongoing residual viral\nreplication in proviral sequences under successful DTG monotherapy in\nindividuals who were switched to DTG after cART initiation during\nprimary HIV infection. As monotherapy is not recommended as a general\ntreatment option, it should only be revisited in carefully designed\ntrials enrolling selected participants with adherent treatment history,\nlow HIV-1 reservoir size, and potential additional parameters to reduce\ndrug burden in PWH.\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n***Data availability.*** Data availability is described in Supplementary\nAppendix 6 .\n\n\n***Financial support.*** This study was supported by the Swiss National\nScience Foundation (SNF) (grant number 179571 to H.

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals.

This reservoir is a major barrier to cure. Sequencing studies have revealed that the population of proviruses persisting in ART-treated individuals is dominated by defective proviruses that cannot give rise to viral rebound due to fatal defects including large deletions and APOBEC3-mediated hypermutation. Near full genome sequencing (nFGS) of individual proviruses is used in reservoir assays to provide an estimate of the fraction of proviruses that are intact. nFGS methods rely on a long-distance outer PCR capturing most (~9 kb) of the genome, followed by nested inner PCRs. The outer PCR is carried out at limit dilution, and interpretation of the results is based on the assumption that all proviruses are quantitatively captured. Here, we evaluate nFGS methods using the intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA), a multiplex digital droplet PCR assay that quantitates intact and defective proviruses with single molecule sensitivity using only short, highly efficient amplicons. We analyzed proviral templates of known sequence to avoid the additional complication of sequence polymorphism. With the IPDA, we quantitated molecular yields at each step of nFGS methods. We demonstrate that nFGS methods are inefficient and miss ~70% of full-length proviruses due to amplification failure at the initial outer PCR step. In contrast, proviruses with large internal deletions encompassing 70% of the genome can be quantitatively amplified under the same conditions. Accurate measurement of the latent reservoir of HIV-1 is essential for evaluating the efficacy of cure strategies, and the bias against full length proviruses in nFGS methods must be considered.\n\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the quantification and sequencing of HIV-1 proviruses, particularly in the context of evaluating near full-length genome sequencing methods.

The\ndevelopment of antiretroviral drug resistance is a major threat to\neffective antiretroviral therapy (ART), yet studies on the prevalence of\ndrug resistance in Kazakhstan are sparse. In this study on the molecular\nepidemiology of HIV in Kazakhstan, we analyzed 968 partial HIV-1 *pol*\nsequences that were collected between 2017 and 2020 from PLHIV across\nall regions of Kazakhstan, covering almost 3% of PLHIV in 2020.\nSequences predominantly represented subtypes A6 (57%) and CRF02_AG\n(41%), with 32% of sequences exhibiting high-level drug resistance. We\nfurther identified distinct drug-resistant mutations (DRMs) in the two\nsubtypes: subtype A6 showed a propensity for DRMs A62V, G190S, K101E,\nand D67N, while CRF02_AG showed a propensity for K103N and V179E. Codon\nusage analysis revealed that different mutational pathways for the two\nsubtypes may explain the difference in G190S and V179E frequencies.\nPhylogenetic analysis highlighted differences in the timing and\ngeographic spread of both subtypes within the country, with\nA62V-harboring subtype A6 sequences clustering on the phylogeny,\nindicative of sustained transmission of the mutation. Our findings\nsuggest an HIV epidemic characterized by high levels of drug resistance\nand differential DRM frequencies between subtypes. This emphasizes the\nimportance of drug resistance monitoring within Kazakhstan, together\nwith DRM and subtype screening at diagnosis, to tailor drug regimens and\nprovide effective, virally suppressive ART.\n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1. Ethical Approval, Study Design, and Population\n\nEthical approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional\nResearch Ethics Committee, Nazarbayev University, Kazakhstan. Data\nanalysis was approved by the ethics committee of the School of\nBiological Sciences, University of Edinburgh.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2020, 1004 participants registered with the Kazakh\nScientific Centre of Dermatology and Infectious Diseases, Almaty,\nKazakhstan; signed informed consent forms; and consented to blood sample\ncollections for this study. Participants enrolled in the study from all\n15 regions of Kazakhstan. Analyses on the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count were\nperformed using the BD FACS Count Reagent Kit™ (BD Biosciences, San\nJose, CA, USA), and viral load analyses were performed using the\nAmpliSens ^®^ HIV-Monitor-FRT Kit (InterLabService, Moscow, Russia). A\nquestionnaire was administered to participants to collect information\nregarding medical history, HIV risk behaviors, and existing\nco-infections (including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus\n(HCV), tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted infections). Testing for\nHCV and HBV was carried out on blood samples, using the Anti-HCV-ELISA\nBest Kit (Vector-Best, Novosibirsk, Russia) and the HBsAg-ELISA Best Kit\n(Vector-Best, Novosibirsk, Russia), respectively. Patients reporting\nsymptoms consistent with tuberculosis were screened for tuberculosis\nusing chest X-rays.\n\n### 2.2. Epidemiological Data\n\nEpidemiological data were available for all participants, including the\nsample collection year, the sex of the participant, the region of\nresidence, the reported transmission route, and ART regimens. To\nfacilitate analysis, the 15 regions of residence were regrouped into 7\nbroader geographical regions ( Figure 1 , termed \"Regions\"), as follows:\n\"Northern Kazakhstan\", which includes North Kazakhstan and Kostanay;\n\"Southern Kazakhstan\", which includes Turkistan, Kyzylorda, and Zhambyl;\n\"Eastern Kazakhstan\", which includes Pavlodar and East Kazakhstan;\n\"Western Kazakhstan\", which includes West Kazakhstan, Atyrau, Mangystau,\nand Aktobe; \"Central Kazakhstan\", which includes Karagandy; \"Astana\",\nwhich includes the capital city Astana and Akmola, Astana's surrounding\nregion; and \"Almaty\", which includes the city Almaty and its homonymous\nsurrounding region.\n\nFigure 1\n\nRegional map of Kazakhstan, according to 2020 administrative divisions.\nRegions are grouped and colored according to broader geographical\nregions of sample collection, with the numbers denoting the number of\nsequences sampled from each grouped region ( *n* = 964, NA = 4).\n\nIndividual ART regimens were summarized as 1st-, 2nd-, or\nmixed-generation regimens according to the specific nucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) administered: zidovudine (AZT),\ndidanosine (DDI), stavudine (D4T), and lamivudine (3TC) were classified\nas 1st-generation NRTIs; abacavir (ABC), tenofovir (TDF), and\nemtricitabine (FTC) were classified as 2nd-generation NRTIs; nevirapine\n(NVP) was classified as a 1st-generation NNRTI; and efavirenz (EFV),\netravirine (ETR), and rilpivirine (RPV) were classified as\n2nd-generation NNRTIs. Any protease inhibitors (PIs,\ndarunavir/ritonavir, DRV/r; DRV/cobicistat, DRV/c; lopinavir/r, LPV/r)\nor integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs, dolutegravir, DTG)\nadministered were not considered for the 1st-, 2nd-, or mixed-generation\nregimen classification, as subsequent analysis of DRMs only considered\nmutations in reverse transcriptase.\n\n### 2.3. Sequence Generation\n\nThe mRNA from blood samples was purified using the Ribo-zol-C Kit\n(InterLabService, Moscow, Russia) and used for RT-PCR, followed by *pol*\ngene sequencing using AmpliSens ^®^ HIV-Resist-Seq (Amplisens, Moscow,\nRussia) and Applied Biosystems ^®^ Genetic Analyzer 3130 (Applied\nBiosystems Inc., Foster, RI, USA). Specifically, the sequence data\nconsisted of partial HIV-1 *pol* gene sequences (covering protease and\nthe 5′-end of reverse transcriptase, positions 2253 to 3337 on the HXB2\nreference genome). After the removal of duplicates and sequence\nalignment, the final dataset consisted of 968 HIV-1 sequences from PLHIV\nin Kazakhstan.\n\n### 2.4. Sequence Subtyping\n\nHIV-1 sequences were subtyped using REGA v3 \\[ 18 \\], with inconclusive\nsequences cross-checked against SCUEAL \\[ 19 \\] and their location on a\nmaximum likelihood phylogeny (generated using IQ-TREE v2.1.2 \\[ 20 \\]).\n\n### 2.5. Drug Resistance Profiling\n\nThe 968 HIV-1 *pol* sequences were screened for DRMs using the Stanford\nHIV Drug Resistance Database \\[ 21 \\]. Specifically, the sequences were\nscreened for mutations in protease and reverse transcriptase, and drug\nresistance scores (susceptible, potential low-, low-, intermediate-, and\nhigh-level resistance) were outputted by the Stanford HIVdb Program \\[\n22 \\] for each of the sequences to the following 13/15 ARVs administered\nto patients in our dataset: 3TC, ABC, AZT, D4T, DDI, FTC, TDF, ETR, EFV,\nNVP, RPV, DRV/r, and LPV/r. Due to a lack of integrase sequence\ncoverage, drug resistance profiling for DTG was not possible, while\nDRV/c is not an ARV screened for on the current version of the Stanford\nHIV Drug Resistance Database.\n\n### 2.6. Phylogenetic Analysis\n\nPhylogenetic trees were produced for subtypes A6 and CRF02_AG using\nNextstrain \\[ 23 \\]. Prior to phylogenetic analysis, 7 outgroup\nsequences for tree rooting were downloaded from the Los Alamos National\nLaboratories HIV Sequence Database \\[ 24 \\] for each subtype, and sites\nof major DRMs (23 codon positions) were masked. Within the Nextstrain\npipeline, maximum likelihood phylogenies were constructed using IQ-TREE\n\\[ 25 \\], with substitution models automatically assigned using\nModelFinder \\[ 26 \\] (TVM + F + R7 for A6 and TVM + F + R6 for\nCRF02_AG). Time-resolved phylogenies were generated using TreeTime \\[ 27\n\\] with the least-squares method for rooting, and ancestral state\nreconstruction was performed for geographic regions and A62V\ntransmission. The final trimmed A6 ( *n* = 552) and CRF02_AG ( *n* =\n392) phylogenies were plotted in R v4.2.2 \\[ 28 \\], using packages\n*ggtree* \\[ 29 \\] and *ggtreeExtra* \\[ 30 \\].\n\n### 2.7. Statistical Analysis\n\nAll statistical analyses were carried out in R v4.2.2 \\[ 28 \\],\nincluding a logistic stepwise regression model to determine which\nfactors were associated with the presence of high-level drug resistance\n(with adjusted odds ratios, aORs, calculated for statistically\nsignificant variables among the crude ORs), and χ ^2^ tests for\nheterogeneity (or Fisher's exact test for smaller count values) to\ndetermine whether differences in observed variable frequencies were\nstatistically significant.\n\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. Demographic Characterization of Study Population\n\nBetween 2017 and 2020, 968 HIV-1 sequences were collected from PLHIV in\nKazakhstan, with the highest number (389, 40.2%) collected in 2019 (\nTable 2 ). Of the sequenced participants, 468 (48.3%) were female, and\nparticipants' ages ranged from 4 to 77 years (median = 41). The median\ntime since HIV diagnosis was 8 years (range 1--22 years), the median\ntime of ART was 4 years (range 0--15 years, with 7 individuals not\nundergoing ART), and the median time between diagnosis and ART\ninitiation was 2 years (range 0--17 years, with only 268 (28.2%)\nindividuals initiating ART within a year of diagnosis). Although\naccording to *current* ART guidelines, only 12 (1.2%) participants were\non preferred regimens and 471 (48.7%) were on alternative regimens,\naccording to 2017--2020 guidelines, by the time that most participants\nwere registered, 386 (39.9%) were on preferred regimens and 258 (26.7%)\nwere on alternative regimens ( Table 1 and Table 2 ). Almost half of\nparticipants were on second-generation ART regimens (464, 47.9%),\nfollowed by mixed- (291, 30.1%) and first-generation regimens (204,\n21.1%). The combination of FTC + TDF + EFV was the most common (386,\n39.9%) ART regimen administered ( Table 2 ). Most participants reported\nno travel abroad (916, 94.6%) and were negative for reported or evident\nsexually transmitted infections (899, 92.9%). All participants were\ntested for other coinfections, with 409 (42.3%) individuals positive for\nHCV antibodies, 35 (3.6%) positive for HBV antigens, and 219 (22.6%)\nmeeting Kazakh tuberculosis diagnostic criteria.\n\nHIV-1 subtypes A6 and CRF02_AG made up almost the entire epidemic\nbetween them (954, 98.6%), with subtype A6 being the most prevalent in\nour dataset (553, 57.1%, Table 2 ). While subtype A6 and CRF02_AG\nsequences were sampled from all regions, the distribution of sequences\nacross the regions differed significantly ( *p* -value = 5 × 10 ^−4^ ),\nwith CRF02_AG found predominantly in Almaty (175, 43.6%) and Southern\nKazakhstan (86, 21.4%) and subtype A6 found more evenly across regions,\nwith its highest frequency in Central Kazakhstan (148, 26.8%).\nHeterosexual HIV-1 infection was the most commonly reported transmission\nroute (566, 58.5%), followed by transmission among PWID in 364 (37.6%)\nindividuals ( Table 2 ). The reported transmission routes also differed\nbetween subtypes A6 and CRF02_AG ( *p* -value = 2.8 × 10 ^−5^ ), with\nheterosexual transmission more commonly reported alongside subtype A6\ninfections (63.1% vs. 52.1%) and PWID transmission more commonly\nreported alongside CRF02_AG infections (44.1% vs. 33.3%). When comparing\nheterosexual and PWID transmission routes, men were more likely to\nacquire HIV through injecting drug use (60.2%), while women were more\nlikely to do so through heterosexual contacts (83.3%, *p* -value \\< 2.2\n× 10 ^−16^ ). For more recent diagnoses, the probability of acquiring\nHIV through PWID transmission routes decreased by 11% compared to\nheterosexual routes for every year change in diagnosis time ( *p* -value\n= 5.88 × 10 ^−14^ ).\n\nAmongst reported heterosexual transmissions ( *n* = 566), risk factors\nwere assessed for 472 (83.4%) participants. Of these, no risk group was\nregistered for 326 (69.1%, 33.7% of all 968 study participants)\nindividuals, while 3 (0.6%, 0.3% of total) participants were recorded as\nsex workers and 143 (30.3%, 14.8% of total) were recorded as having had\nsexual contact with either sex workers, PWID, or PLHIV.\n\n### 3.2. Drug Resistance Profiles\n\nOver one-third (355, 36.7%) of the HIV-1 study sequences exhibited\nlow-to-high-level drug resistance to at least one of the 13 ARVs\nscreened for, with almost all exhibiting high levels of drug resistance\n(311, 87%). Of those with drug resistance, 304/355 (85.6%) participants\nhad sequences resistant to at least one drug on their ART regimen, while\n282/311 (90.7%) participants had sequences with high-level resistance to\nat least one drug on their ART regimen. High-level NNRTI resistance was\nmost prevalent (291, 30.1%), followed by high-level NRTI resistance\n(163, 16.8%). Only 2 sequences had high-level PI resistance, and both\nhigh-level NRTI and NNRTI resistance mutations were exhibited in 143\n(14.8%) sequences ( Table 2 ).\n\nTo determine whether certain factors were associated with the presence\nof high-level drug resistance, a logistic stepwise regression model was\nused. The best-fitting model (AIC: 1170.4) included ART generation, CD4+\nT-cell count, and the time undergoing ART; the odds of high-level drug\nresistance were higher for individuals on second- (aOR: 2.74, 95% CI:\n1.83--4.16) and mixed-generation (aOR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.00--2.37)\nregimens compared to those on first-generation regimens. No significant\ndifferences in the frequency of high-level drug resistance were found\nbetween subtypes A6 and CRF02_AG; however, some differences in\nindividual ARV use were detected, including a moderately higher use of\nNVP in patients with CRF02_AG infections ( Figure S1A ). Individual ARV\nuse significantly differed in 7/15 ARVs between patients with or without\nhigh-level drug resistance ( Figure S1B ), with FTC, TDF, and EFV (all\nsecond-generation ARVs) having been more frequently taken by patients\nwith high-level drug resistance.\n\n### 3.3. Distinct DRMs among Subtypes A6 and CRF02_AG\n\nOur 968-sequence dataset included 364 (37.6%) sequences with\nNRTI-associated DRMs, 340 (35.1%) with NNRTI-associated DRMs, and 12\n(1.2%) with major PI-associated DRMs. Of these, 101/364 (27.7%) had ≥two\nNRTI-associated DRMs (excluding A62V) and 152/340 (44.7%) had ≥two\nNNRTI-associated DRMs. Due to the high proportion of sequences with ≥\ntwo NRTI/NNRTI-associated DRMs, we tested whether the frequency of\ncertain double DRMs was higher than expected when assuming each mutation\narises independently. We tested this for an NRTI pair of DRMs (M184V and\nK65R) and an NNRTI pair (K103N and G190S); for M184V and K65R, the\nfrequency of double DRMs was significantly higher than expected (4%, *p*\n-value = 0.015), while for K103N and G190S, the frequency was\nsignificantly lower (0.9%, *p* -value = 6.2 × 10 ^−4^ ).\n\nIn total, 22 DRMs were present at over 1% frequency, which are\nsummarized according to the subtype in Table 3 and according to ART\ngeneration in Table S1 . Of these, eight DRMs were present at over 4%\nfrequency, plotted according to subtype and ART generation in Figure 2\nA,B, respectively. The frequencies of certain DRMs were significantly\ndifferent between subtypes A6 and CRF02_AG; accessory NRTI-associated\nmutation A62V was more frequently observed in subtype A6, alongside\nmajor NRTI mutation D67N, major NNRTI mutation G190S, and accessory\nNNRTI mutation K101E, while major NNRTI-associated mutation K103N and\naccessory NNRTI mutation V179E were more frequently observed in CRF02_AG\n( Table 3 , Figure 2 A). Of the eight DRMs present at over 4% frequency,\nfive were significantly more common amongst individuals on\nsecond-generation ART regimens, corroborating the findings of more\nfrequent high-level drug resistance amongst second-generation regimens (\nFigure 2 B); however, individual ARVs did not significantly affect the\npresence of any of the 22 DRMs.\n\nFigure 2\n\nDrug-resistant mutations (DRMs) present at over 4% frequency among\nindividuals in the Kazakhstan dataset ( *n* = 968), according to HIV\nsubtype ( **A** ) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) generation ( **B** ).\nHighlighted boxes indicate significant differences between categories\nbased on χ ^2^ tests for heterogeneity, with asterisks indicating *p*\n-value cut-offs (\\* = *p* -value \\< 0.05; \\*\\* = *p* -value \\< 0.01;\n\\*\\*\\*\\* = *p* -value \\< 0.0001).\n\nFor the six DRMs with significantly different frequencies between\nsubtypes, we investigated differences in codon usage between pairs to\ndetermine if codon usage differences explained the differing DRM\nfrequencies ( Table 4 ). For K103N and K101E, no significant differences\nin codon usage were found between subtypes A6 and CRF02 in sequences\nwithout the respective DRM. For A62V and D67N, codon usage frequencies\nsignificantly differed among the sequences without the DRM; however, for\neach site, only one nucleotide change was required in each codon for DRM\npresence. For G190S and V179E, codon usage frequencies significantly\ndiffered among the sequences without the DRM, with codons requiring two\nnucleotide changes for DRM acquisition (as opposed to a single one)\nbeing more common in the subtype with a lower DRM frequency (G190S for\nCRF02_AG, V179E for A6). This suggests that different mutational\npathways may affect the significantly different frequencies of G190S and\nV179E in subtypes A6 and CRF02_AG.\n\n### 3.4. Phylogenetic Analysis of Subtypes A6 and CRF02_AG\n\nTime-resolved phylogenies for subtypes A6 ( Figure 3 A) and CRF02_AG (\nFigure 3 B) were produced using Nextstrain. The time to the most recent\ncommon ancestor (tMRCA) for the subtype A6 sequences was 10 years\nearlier than for the CRF02_AG ones (tMRCA = 1983 vs. tMRCA = 1993,\nrespectively). The A6 phylogeny showed a deep split in the tree early in\nthe epidemic (1989) from where 98.7% of sequences originated, indicating\nan early separation between sequences originating within Central\nKazakhstan and spreading to Western Kazakhstan ( Figure 3 A, bottom) vs.\nsequences spreading through Southern and Eastern Kazakhstan ( Figure 3\nA, top), with the latter sequences overwhelmingly harboring DRM A62V. No\nsingle major split was observed in the CRF02_AG phylogeny. Instead,\nancestral state reconstruction (not shown) indicated the presence of\nmultiple lineages descended from a common ancestor in Almaty, emerging\nin other regions at later stages in the epidemic. Other than the clear\nclustering of A62V mutations in the A6 phylogeny, no other distinct\npatterns of DRM transmission were observed. For CRF02_AG ( Figure 3 B)\nand, to a lesser extent, subtype A6 ( Figure 3 A), the presence of\nhigh-resistance sequences on the phylogeny mirrors the presence of\nK103N, a major NNRTI-associated DRM.\n\nFigure 3\n\nTime-resolved subtype A6 ( **A** , *n* =552, tMRCA = 1983) and\ncirculating recombinant from CRF02_AG ( **B** , *n* = 392, tMRCA = 1993)\ntrees.

Discussion\n\nIn this study, we analyzed 968 HIV-1 *pol* sequences from ART-receiving\nindividuals from all regions of Kazakhstan, covering almost 3% of the\nestimated number of PLHIV in 2020. Our aim was to quantify levels of\nHIV-1 drug resistance, identify DRMs, and elucidate the evolutionary\nhistory of the HIV-1 epidemic in Kazakhstan using a phylogenetic\napproach (including the appearance and spread of DRMs within\nKazakhstan). Among sequenced participants, the Kazakh HIV-1 epidemic is\nalmost exclusively comprised (954, 98.6%) of two subtypes, A6 and\nCRF02_AG, with the frequencies of each one varying across geographical\nregions in the country. Almost one-third (311, 32.1%) of sequences\nexhibited high-level drug resistance; however, distinct DRMs were\nobserved among subtypes A6 and CRF02_AG. Phylogenetic analysis revealed\ndifferences between the two subtypes regarding their introduction into\nKazakhstan, both in timing and location. Our findings provide insights\ninto the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in Kazakhstan, a country in\nCentral Asia where HIV incidence continues to increase.\n\n### 4.1. Demographics of the HIV-1 Epidemic\n\nWhile samples were collected from all regions of Kazakhstan, sequences\nfrom Almaty, Central, and Southern Kazakhstan were overrepresented\ncompared to other regions ( Table 2 ), as they constitute the more\npopulous regions of the country \\[ 31 \\]. In the WHO region of Eastern\nEurope and Central Asia, 91% of new HIV infections as of 2020 were among\nkey populations, including PWID (43%), sex workers (13%), MSM (16%), and\nsex partners of all key populations (18%) \\[ 3 \\]. In our study, PWID\ntransmission was reported in 37.6% of participants, lower than WHO\nregional estimates but higher than the 30.1% prevalence reported for\nsurveys conducted between 2002 and 2013, where Kazakhstan was identified\nas the country with the highest HIV prevalence in Central Asia and the\nCaucasus \\[ 32 \\]. In total, 14.8% of individuals reported heterosexual\ntransmission associated with sexual contact with key populations;\nhowever, sex workers (0.3%) and MSM (0.5%) were underrepresented in our\ndataset, likely due to the stigma associated with reporting. Indeed,\n33.7% of heterosexual transmissions in our study had no associated risk\nfactor recorded, which could be a sign of underreporting of risk\nbehaviors and/or of a shifting epidemic, towards the general population.\nAccording to official statistics, 66% of HIV infections in Kazakhstan in\n2008 were among PWID, whereas the current transmission trends in 2021\nare increasingly shifting toward heterosexual and MSM populations,\nconstituting, respectively, 65.7% and 13.6% of all PLHIV \\[ 33 \\]. This\nmay reflect successes in risk reduction for PWID in the country \\[ 34 ,\n35 \\]. Our results indicate that men are more likely to acquire HIV\nthrough PWID transmission, while women are more likely to do so through\nheterosexual contact, consistent with findings from the HIV epidemic in\nKyrgyzstan \\[ 17 \\]. Among our participants, the number of patients\ninfected with subtype A6 was 1.4 times higher than CRF02_AG ( Table 2 ).\nHistorically, subtype A6 is known to have originated in Central Asia and\nformer Soviet Union (FSU) countries \\[ 16 \\], and still remains the most\npredominant HIV variant in this region, including Kazakhstan, through\nautochthonous transmission \\[ 36 , 37 \\].\n\n### 4.2. High-Level Drug Resistance and Distinct DRMs between the Subtypes\n\nOur study reports high frequencies (32.1%) of high-level drug resistance\namong PLHIV in Kazakhstan. Prior studies had smaller sample sizes. A\nstudy of 85 isolates collected between 2001 and 2003 across Kazakhstan\nfound no primary DRMs associated with the sequences \\[ 14 \\]. Another\nstudy of 165 ART-naïve patients, with sequences collected between 2009\nand 2013, reported a low (3%) prevalence of drug resistance \\[ 13 \\]. A\nstudy of 602 sequences collected between 2017 and 2019 from\nART-experienced patients reported high-level NRTI resistance in 10% of\nsequences and high-level NNRTI resistance in 21% of them \\[ 7 \\].\nComparing these earlier prevalence estimates to our findings of 16.8%\nand 30% high-level NRTI and NNRTI resistance, respectively, our current\nstudy suggests an increase in the prevalence of drug resistance in\nKazakhstan over time. Using our logistic regression model to determine\nwhether certain factors were associated with the presence of high-level\ndrug resistance, we found the odds of resistance to be higher for\nindividuals on ART regimens containing second-generation ARVs. While it\nis possible that the administration of second-generation ARVs is causing\nhigh levels of drug resistance in Kazakhstan, it is even more likely\nthat the observed correlation is a reflection of patients being\nprescribed second-generation ARVs after developing high-level resistance\nand thus failing therapy with first-generation ART regimens.\n\nThe prevalence of high-level drug resistance in our study did not\nsignificantly differ between subtypes A6 and CRF02_AG. However, distinct\nDRM frequencies were observed between the two subtypes, namely a higher\nprevalence of A62V, G190S, K101E, and D67N in subtype A6, and a higher\nprevalence of K103N and V179E in CRF02_AG ( Table 3 ). Despite the\ncomparatively higher prevalence of K103N in CRF02_AG, the mutation was\nstill the most prevalent major NNRTI-associated DRM in subtype A6 as\nwell. The high frequency of this mutation within our study population is\nof concern due to the high-level NNRTI resistance that this causes,\nreducing NVP and EFV susceptibility by about 50- and 20-fold,\nrespectively \\[ 21 , 38 \\]. A study conducted in Russia, where subtype\nA6 predominates, revealed that A62V was prevalent in 63% of ART-naïve\nHIV cases \\[ 39 \\]; a second Russian study reported that DRMs A62V and\nG190S were significantly associated with subtype A6, similar to our\nfindings \\[ 40 \\]. To determine if codon usage differences explained the\ndiffering DRM frequencies between the two subtypes, we carried out a\ncodon usage analysis ( Table 4 ). This suggested that different\nmutational pathways may be affecting the appearance of G190S and V179E.\nA previous study from Russia corroborates our findings for G190S: the\nmutation was not found in CRF02_AG compared to subtype A6 ( *p* -value\n\\< 0.001) and the DRM in A6 resulted from a single nucleotide transition\n(G to A), a concerning predisposition due to the high level of NNRTI\nresistance caused by the mutation \\[ 41 \\].\n\n### 4.3. Evolutionary History of the HIV-1 Epidemic in Kazakhstan\n\nPhylogenetic analyses in Nextstrain revealed that the tMRCA for subtype\nA6 sequences was earlier than for CRF02_AG sequences (1983 vs. 1993,\nrespectively, Figure 3 ), with a deep split in the tree in 1989, from\nwhere 98.7% of the sequences originate and spread to distinct regions.\nThis split is consistent with the chronology of HIV-1 subtype A6 in\nKazakhstan; HIV-1 transmission spread through FSU countries after the\ndownfall of the Soviet Union in 1991, with the first documented HIV\noutbreak in Kazakhstan in 1996 in Temirtau, a city in Central Kazakhstan\n\\[ 42 , 43 , 44 \\]. There are no prior studies investigating the origins\nof CRF02_AG in Kazakhstan. Our analysis revealed that the oldest\nCRF02_AG infections may have occurred in Almaty, from where they spread\nto other regions. This, alongside the overwhelming frequency of CRF02_AG\nin Almaty and Southern Kazakhstan, is consistent with findings\ncharacterizing the HIV-1 epidemic in Kyrgyzstan, directly south of\nKazakhstan, where CRF02_AG dominates the epidemic \\[ 17 \\].\n\n### 4.4. Limitations\n\nAlong with strengths, our study has some limitations. Firstly, most\nsequences analyzed in this study were obtained from ART-experienced\nPLHIV and we were unable to (a) estimate the prevalence of drug\nresistance in ART-naïve PLHIV and (b) distinguish between acquired or\ntransmitted DRMs though phylogenies that provide evidence for A62V\ntransmission in subtype A6. While tools such as Nextstrain provide rapid\nestimates for phylogenetic analysis of epidemics, the results may be\nless accurate than those of more computationally intensive programs.\n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions\n\nOur study describes the molecular epidemiology of the HIV-1 epidemic in\nKazakhstan, characterized by high levels of drug resistance and distinct\nDRMs between subtypes A6 and CRF02_AG, with some (G190S and V179E)\nsuggesting that different mutational pathways may be contributing to the\ndistinct rates of DRM acquisition between the two variants. The high\nlevels of resistance exemplify the need for drug resistance monitoring\nwithin Kazakhstan, including DRM screening at diagnosis, while distinct\nDRMs between subtypes argue for the inclusion of subtyping within\nstandard diagnostic protocols. These practices will inform the\nprescription of the most effective ART regimens, thus helping to prevent\nthe emergence of new DRMs.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nS.A. received funding for this study by Nazarbayev University under the\nGrant: 20122022CRP1605.

Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

We determined the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity in Bulgaria during 2012--2020 using polymerase sequences from 1053 of 2010 (52.4%) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. Sequences were analyzed for DRM using the WHO HIV SDRM list implemented in the calculated population resistance tool at Stanford University. Genetic diversity was inferred using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetics. Cluster detection and characterization was performed using MicrobeTrace. The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%). Most (34/60, 56.7%) of the SDRMs were present in transmission clusters of different subtypes composed mostly of male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC), including a 14-member cluster of subtype B sequences from 12 MMSC and two males reporting heterosexual contact; 13 had the L90M PI mutation and one had the T215S NRTI SDRM. We found a low SDRM prevalence amid high HIV-1 diversity among ART-naive patients in Bulgaria during 2012--2020. The majority of SDRMs were found in transmission clusters containing MMSC, indicative of onward spread of SDRM in drug-naive individuals. Our study provides valuable information on the transmission dynamics of HIV drug resistance in the context of high genetic diversity in Bulgaria, for the development of enhanced prevention strategies to end the epidemic.\n\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity using sequences from ART-naive individuals.

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences.

HIV Pretreatment DR (PDR) and drug resistance mutation (DRM) prevalence was estimated using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database. The PDR level was interpreted according to the WHO standard PDR survey protocols. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database and subsequently confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Transmission clusters were determined using Cluster Picker.\nResults\nAnalyses of HIV subtypes showed that EECA, in general, has the same HIV genetic variants of sub-subtype A6, CRF63_02A1, and subtype B, with different frequencies and representation for each country.\nThe prevalence of PDR to any drug class was 2.8% in Uzbekistan, 4.2% in Azerbaijan, 4.5% in Russia, 9.2% in Armenia, 13.9% in Belarus, and 16.7% in Tajikistan. PDR to protease inhibitors (PIs) was not detected in any country. PDR to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) was not detected among patients in Azerbaijan, and was relatively low in other countries, with the highest prevalence in Tajikistan (5.6%). The prevalence of PDR to nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was the lowest in Uzbekistan (2.8%) and reached 11.1% and 11.4% in Tajikistan and Belarus, respectively.\nGenetic transmission network analyses identified 226/1071 (21.1%) linked individuals, forming 93 transmission clusters mainly containing two or three sequences. We found that the time since HIV diagnosis in clustered patients was significantly shorter than that in unclustered patients (1.26 years vs 2.74 years).

We employed state-of-art maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylodynamic analyses to comprehensively describe the evolutionary dynamics of the HIV-1 epidemic in Ethiopia. We used Bayesian phylodynamic models to estimate the dynamics of the effective population size (N) and reproductive numbers (Re) through time for the HIV epidemic in Ethiopia.\nResults:\nOur analysis revealed that the Ethiopian HIV-1 epidemic originated from two independent introductions at the beginning of the 1970s and 1980s from eastern and southern African countries, respectively, followed by epidemic growth reaching its maximum in the early 1990s. We identified three large clusters with a majority of Ethiopian sequences. Phylodynamic analyses revealed that all three clusters were characterized by high transmission rates during the early epidemic, followed by a decline in HIV-1 transmissions after 1990. Re was high (4–6) during the earlier time of the epidemic but dropped significantly and remained low (Re < 1) after the mid-1990s. Similarly, with an expected shift in time, the effective population size (N) steadily increased until the beginning of 2000, followed by a decline and stabilization until recent years. The phylodynamic analyses corroborated the modeled UNAIDS incidence and prevalence estimates.\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing or data.

We described HIV-1\npre-treatment drug resistance (PDR) patterns, effect of viral clades on\nPDR, and programmatic implications on first-line regimens in Cameroon. A\nsentinel surveillance of PDR was conducted from 2014 to 2019. Sequencing\nof HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase was performed, and HIVDR was\ninterpreted using Stanford HIVdb.v.9.4. In total, 379 sequences were\nobtained from participants (62% female, mean age 36 ± 10 years). The\noverall PDR rate was 15.0% \\[95% CI: 11.8--19.0\\] nationwide, with\nsignificant disparity between regions ( *p* = 0.03). NNRTI PDR was\nhighest (12.4%), of which 7.9% had DRMs to EFV/NVP. Two regions had\nEFV/NVP PDR above the 10% critical threshold, namely the Far North (15%)\nand East (10.9%). Eighteen viral strains were identified, predominated\nby CRF02_AG (65.4%), with no influence of genetic diversity PDR\noccurrence. TDF-3TC-DTG predictive efficacy was superior (98.4%) to\nTDF-3TC-EFV (92%), *p* \\< 0.0001. The overall high rate of PDR in\nCameroon, not substantially affected by the wide HIV-1 genetic\ndiversity, underscores the poor efficacy of EFV/NVP-based first-line ART\nnationwide, with major implications in two regions of the country. This\nsupports the need for a rapid transition to NNRTI-sparing regimens, with\nTDF-3TC-DTG having optimal efficacy at the programmatic level.\n\n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1. Study Design, Sites, and Population\n\nWe carried out a cross-sectional and analytical study for five years,\nfrom December 2014 to June 2019. The enrollment of participants was\ncarried out in health facilities of eight regions of Cameroon: Centre,\nLittoral, East, West, Northwest, Southwest, North, and Far North. In\neach region, patients were recruited in both urban and rural sites at\nthe hospitals with the highest patient frequency. Table 1 shows the\nhealth facilities from which patients were recruited. HIV-1 genotypic\nresistance tests were performed at the Virology Laboratory of the\nChantal Biya International Reference Center (CIRCB). The study\nparticipants consisted of adult patients initiating ART in the health\nfacilities of regions previously cited. Using previous HIV prevalence\nstudies in each region, considering a 5% error margin and 95% confidence\ninterval, an estimated minimum sample size was calculated for each\nregion, following which we based our enrollment.\n\n\n### 2.2. Selection Criteria\n\nIncluded in our study were HIV-1 infected patients aged above 19 years\n(adults per WHO definitions) with no prior history of ART treatment. Not\nincluded in our study were patients who were re-initiating ART, those\nwhose samples were unsuccessful at sequencing, and those who were\nco-infected with either viral hepatitis B or C. Patients co-infected\nwith viral hepatitis were to excluded to limit confounders related to\npotential HBV drug exposure that interferes with HIV PDR selection\n(tenofovir, lamivudine, emtricitabine); HCV/HIV co-infection also\nexhibits differences in viral genotypes as compared to mono-infection.\n\n### 2.3. Data Collection\n\nPatients presenting for ART initiation at the various recruitment sites\nwere encountered by the recruitment clinician. Data collection was\ncarried out using a pre-established data abstraction form at each site\nafter obtaining a thorough medical history and clinical examination to\nminimize recruitment of participants with previous drug exposure. Data\ncollected included the following: age, sex, region of origin, zone of\nresidence (urban/rural), and WHO clinical stage. For each participant,\n10 mL of venous blood was collected in an EDTA tube. The tubes were\ncentrifuged at a speed of 1800 rpm, separated for plasma collection,\nplasma aliquoted (1 mL) in cryotubes, stored at −20 °C, and transported\nto the CIRCB, where biological analyzes were carried out.\n\n### 2.4. Ethical Considerations\n\nThis study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of\nthe 1964 Helsinki Declaration, revised in October 2013. Ethical\nclearance was obtained from the Institutional Research Ethics Committee\n(CIER) of the Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of\nYaoundé 1 (FMBS/UY1), as well as the authorizations of the different\nstructures concerned by the study. Informed consent from all\nparticipants was obtained prior to inclusion after explaining the\npurpose, benefits, and possible risks of the study. Biological exams\nwere free for all participants, and the results were given to the\ntreating physicians to optimize the treatment.\n\n### 2.5. Genotypic Resistance Test\n\nGenotypic resistance testing was carried out in the pol gene (reverse\ntranscriptase and protease regions) as follows. Viral RNA was extracted\nfrom 1 mL of plasma using the QIAGEN kit, following the manufacturer's\ninstructions. For the amplification of the pol region, a previously\nvalidated inhouse genotyping assay was used \\[ 16 \\]. The target\nsequence was first amplified with Reverse Transcription PCR using BS\nprimers (\"5′-GAC AGG ATT ATT TTT TAG GG-3′\") and FRA S1 (\"5′-TT CCC CAT\nATT ACT ATG CTT-3′\") in 25 μL of reaction mixture for 40 cycles. The PCR\nconditions were 50 °C for 30 min, 94 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 30 s, 51 °C\nfor 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by extension at 72 °C for 10\nmin. A semi-Nested PCR was subsequently performed using BS primers\n(\"5′-GAC AGG ATT ATT TTT TAG GG-3′\") and TAK3 (\"5'-GGC TCT TGA TAA TGA\nTAT TAT GT-3′\") in 50 μL of reaction mixture for 30 cycles. The PCR\nconditions were 93 °C for 12 min, 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 45 s, and 72\n°C for 2 min, followed by extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR\nproducts were revealed using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The\nsuccessfully amplified samples were purified and then sequenced by the\nfollowing primers: B (\"5′-AGC AGA CCA GAG CCA ACA GC-3′\"), F (\"5′-CCA\nTCC ATT CCT GGC TTT AAT-3′\"), SEQ1 (\"5′-GAA TGG ATG GCC CAA AA-3′\"),\nSEQ2 (\"5′-TTG AGA TAC AAT GGA AAA GGA AGG-3′\"), SEQ3 (\"5′-CCC TGT GGA\nAAG CAC ATT GTA-3′\"), SEQ4 (\"5′-GCT TCC ACA GGG ATG GAA-3′\"), SEQ5\n(\"5′-CTA TTA AGT CTT TTG ATG GGT CA-3′\"), and TAK3 (\"5′-CCT TGT TTC TGT\nATT TCT GCT-3′\"). The products of the sequencing reaction obtained were\npurified by exclusion chromatography on SEPHADEX G50 resin and then\nsequenced using a genetic analyzer (ABI 3500 ^®^ ).\n\n### 2.6. Sequence Analysis for HIVDR Profiling, Drug Efficacy, and Subtyping\n\nThe resulting sequences encompassing the pol region were assembled and\nedited manually using Seqscape software version 2.5 and Recall version\n2.28 Resistance mutations were interpreted using Stanford HIVdb software\nversion 9.4 ( http://www.hivdb.stanford.edu , accessed on 24 May 2023),\nand all resistance-associated mutations in the samples were identified.\nThe predictive efficacies of each antiretroviral molecule were\ncalculated according to the genotypic drug susceptibility score provided\naccording to HIVdb algorithm ( http://www.hivdb.stanford.edu , accessed\non 24 May 2023). The regimen efficacy for TLD versus TLE was calculated\nirrespective of the presence of M184V due to the beneficial effect of\nthis mutation in improving TDF (a molecule present in both TLD and TLE)\nefficacy while reducing viral replicative fitness. Regarding DTG\nefficacy, during the same study period, we reported a prevalence of 0%\nresistance to DTG in ART naïve patients, inferring 100% predictive\nefficacy of DTG \\[ 17 \\].\n\nSubtyping was conducted using rapid subtyping tools such as COMET, REGA,\nand BLAST. Molecular phylogeny was used for subtype confirmation.\nAlignment and sequence cleaning was carried out using Aliview version\n1.28, and phylogenetic tree inference was carried out using the maximum\nlikelihood method on MEGA 11. The evolutionary history was inferred by\nusing the Maximum Likelihood method and Tamura-Nei model. Initial\ntree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying\nNeighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances\nestimated using the Tamura-Nei model and then selecting the topology\nwith superior log likelihood value. Recombination events were evaluated\nusing RDP.v3 and Simplot++ V1.3. Tree editing was carried out using iTOL\nversion 6.7.3.\n\n### 2.7. Data Entry and Statistical Analysis\n\nThe data was entered and analyzed using Epi Info version 7.2.2.6.\nCategorical variables were described in terms of frequency and\npercentage. The Chi-squared or Fischer's exact tests were used to\ncompare proportions of the qualitative variables. The values were\nexpressed with their 95% confidence interval. The threshold of\nstatistical significance was set at 5%. Any *p* \\< 0.2 from bivariate\nanalysis was included for multivariate analysis through logistic\nregression, adjusting for potential confounders such as age, sex,\nregion, or HIV-1 subtypes.\n\n\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. General Characteristics\n\nA total of 391 participants were recruited, with sequencing successfully\ncarried out in 379 individual participant samples, giving a genotyping\nsuccess rate of 96.9%. The 379 participants with successful sequencing\ndata were from eight regions distributed as follows: 53 (14%) from the\nCenter, 40 (10.6%) for the Far North, 46 (12.1%) for the East, 41\n(10.8%) for the Littoral, 44 (11.6%) for the North, 61 (16.1%) for the\nNorthwest, 49 (12.9%) for the West and 45 (11.9%) for the Southwest. The\nmajority of participants were female (62%), with ages ranging from 20 to\n80 years and a mean ± SD of 36 ± 10 years. The most represented age\ngroup was the 25 to 35 years age group (36%).\n\n### 3.2. Genetic Diversity\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of the sequences reveals that all the patients\nwere infected with type 1 viruses, all belonging to group M. A total of\n15 viral strains were identified. Recombinant forms (CRF02_AG,\nCRF11_cpx, CRF18_cpx, etc.) were the most represented, accounting for\n81.1% of viral strains as compared to 18.2% for pure strains (A1, A3, D,\nG, F1, F2, J). Overall, CRF02_AG was the most represented viral clade,\nwith 65.4% of the total workforce (see Figure 1 ). The complex forms\nidentified were CRF04_cpx, CRF06_cpx, CRF09_cpx, CRF11_cpx, CRF18_cpx,\nCRF37_cpx, and CRF45_cpx).\n\nFigure 1\n\nPhylogenetic Tree of HIV-1 sequences from ART-naive individuals. The\nevolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method\nand Tamura-Nei model \\[ 1 \\]. The tree with the highest log likelihood\n(−69,062.29) is shown. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were\nobtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to\na matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Tamura-Nei model and\nthen selecting the topology with superior log. Cpx = complex recombinant\nforms.\n\n### 3.3. Genotypic Resistance Profile\n\nOf the 379 sequences obtained, 57 had at least one major resistance\nmutation, i.e., a prevalence overall pre-treatment resistance of 15%\n\\[95% CI: 11.8; 19\\]. At the regional level, we observed a significant\ndisparity between the values of the global resistance threshold, ranging\nfrom 9.8% in the North region to 27.5% in the Far North region, *p* =\n0.03.\n\nBoth nationally and regionally, the class of antiretrovirals with the\nhighest resistance rate was that of NNRTIs. The national rate of\nresistance to NNRTIs, all generations combined, was 12.4% \\[95% CI: 9.5;\n16.1\\]. It was highest in the Far North region, at 22.5% \\[95% CI 10.8;\n38.4\\]. However, there was a non-significant disparity between the\ndifferent regions, *p* = 0.16. Regarding resistance to first-generation\nNNRTIs, namely EFV and NVP, the national threshold was 7.9% \\[95% CI:\n5.6; 11.1\\], with extremes of: 4.5% in the North to 15% in the Far\nNorth. Two out of eight regions crossed the 10% threshold; these are the\nregions of the East (10.9%) and the Far North (15%). We identified a\ntotal of five mutations responsible for resistance to these NNRTI. The\nmost prevalent of them was the K103N mutation, identified in 21 (5.5%\n\\[95% CI: 3.7; 8.3\\]) of participants' sequences. This was followed by\nthe E138AGK (3.2% \\[95% CI: 1.8; 5.4\\]), V106I (2.9% \\[95% CI: 1.6;\n5.1\\]), A98G (0.8% \\[95% CI: 0.3; 2.3\\]), and G190E (0.8% \\[95% CI: 0.3;\n2.3\\]). As concerns NRTI, twelve sequences had at least one resistance\nmutation to this drug class, representing a national prevalence of 3.2%\n\\[95% CI: 1.8; 5.4\\]. The Southwest region was most affected, with a\nprevalence of 8.9% \\[95% CI: 2.5; 21.2\\]. Mutations responsible for drug\nresistance in this drug class were mainly the M184V mutation,\nresponsible for resistance to 3TC, identified in six participants (1.6%,\n\\[95% CI: 0.7; 3.4\\]), followed by the K65R mutation, responsible for\nresistance to TDF, identified in four participants (1.1%, \\[95% CI: 0.3;\n2.9\\]). Elsewhere, we identified thymidine analogue mutations\nresponsible for resistance to AZT; K219REN, 4(1.1% \\[95% CI: 0.3; 2.9\\])\nand M41L 2 (0.5% \\[95% CI: 0.09; 2.1\\]). Reverse transcriptase accessory\nmutations were also identified, notably the S68G mutation (4.0%, 95% CI:\n2.4--6.4%). As concerns PI/r, overall pre-treatment resistance to PI/r\nwas 1.3% \\[95% CI: 0.6; 3.1\\]. Pre-treatment PI/r resistance was only\nobserved in three of the eight regions (Far North, East, and West), and\nwas highest in the East region, 4.3% \\[95% CI: 0.5; 14.9\\]. The\nmutations responsible for PI/r resistance were M46I (0.3% \\[95% CI:\n0.05; 1.5\\]), G73S (0.3%), V82F (0.3%), L89V (0.3%), and L90M (0.3%).\nThe accessory mutations identified in the protease region included the\nL24F mutation (0.3%), L33F mutation (0.3%), K43T (0.3%) mutation, and\nthe I47M (0.3%) mutation. Figure 2 shows the proportions of PDR by drug\nclass, while Figure 3 shows the regional mapping of EFV/NVP- PDR by\nregion covered during the survey.\n\nFigure 2\n\nPre-treatment drug resistance (PDR) according to ARV class nationally\nand by geographical region. The histogram shows rates of PDR by ARV\nclass, both at the national level and across regions. We note that\noverall PDR is high, with two regions (Far North and East) surpassing\nthe 10% threshold for EFV/NVP.\n\nFigure 3\n\nRegional mapping of EFV/NVP-PDR.The figure shows the mapping of EFV/NVP\nPDR. Red colour denotes regions with high levels of PDR (above the 10%\nthreshold), orange denotes regions with moderate levels of PDR (5--10%),\nand green denotes regions with levels of PDR below 5%.\n\nThere was no change in the trend of PDR mutations over time; *p* \\>\n0.05. This could be due to the fact that the same ART regimens were used\nfor the first- and second-line throughout the period of 2014--2019\n(first-line: NNRTI-based; second-line: PI/r-based). The trends may\nchange substantially with the transition to Dolutegravir-based regimens\nin the coming years.\n\n### 3.4. Association between Pre-Treatment Drug Resistance, HIV-1 Genetic Diversity, Clinical and Demographics Parameters of the Study Participants\n\nWe found no significant associations between the presence of PDR and sex\n( *p* = 0.54), median age ( *p* = 0.19), WHO clinical stage ( *p* = 1),\nor even HIV-1 genetic diversity ( *p* = see Table 2 ). Table 2 shows the\noccurrence of PDR with respect to pure versus recombinant strains,\nCRF02-AG versus non-CRF02-AG strains, and lastly, complex versus\nnon-complex strains. We observed higher rates of PDR in participants\nfrom the urban regions (26.7%) as compared to the rural region (12.8%);\nOR = 2.4, *p* = 0.021. After multivariate analysis, adjusting for age,\nsex, and subtype, the region of residence (urban region) was\nindependently associated with increased PDR (adjusted *p* = 0.016).\n\n### 3.5. Predictive Efficacy of TLE versus TLD\n\nBy taking into account the resistance to NRTIs (and therefore the\neffectiveness of TDF) and to NNRTIs for the TDF + 3TC + EFV protocol\n(TLE) on the one hand and the efficacy of TDF for the TDF + 3TC + DTG\nprotocol (TLD) on the other hand (DTG being totally effective a priori),\nwe predicted the efficiency of the TDF + 3TC + DTG protocol of 98%\nagainst 92% for TDF + 3TC + EFV ( *p* \\< 0.0001). This superiority of\nthe TLD compared to TLE was also observed in all eight regions,\nincluding a region like the Far North, where the TLE protocol is only\n85% effective compared to 100% TLD. Figure 4 shows the predictive\nefficacy of TLE as compared to TLD in the eight regions.\n\nFigure 4\n\nPredictive efficacy of TLE (TDF + 3TC + EFV) vs. TLD (TDF + 3TC + DTG)\nin Cameroon. The figure shows predictive efficacy of TLD as compared to\nTLE. We observe superior predictive efficacy nationally and across all\nregions, with a marked superiority in the Far North region where EFV/NVP\npre-treatment drug resistance was highest.\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nNationally, in all eight regions studied, we found a high pre-treatment\nresistance rate (15%), regardless of the class of antiretroviral\nmolecules. However, there was a great disparity between the eight\nregions, with resistance rates varying from 6.8% in the North region to\n26.1% and 27.5% in the East and Far North regions, respectively. A study\nconducted in Cameroon and published in 2018 found a similar prevalence,\ni.e., 14.2% of pre-treatment resistance in urban areas \\[ 14 \\]. In\nNamibia and Sierra Leone, two other studies found a high prevalence of\nresistance in ART-naive patients, 12.7% and 36.7%, respectively \\[ 18 ,\n19 \\]. These data are evidence of an increase in pre-treatment\nresistance in resource-constrained countries due to the expansion of\naccess to antiretroviral therapy \\[ 11 \\]. To add to this, this high\nrate of PDR observed is in the context of minimal risks of previous ARV\nexposure (following study inclusion criteria). It is therefore expected\nthat for those with previous ART exposure (PMTCT, ART, PrEP, etc.), PDR\nmay at least be similar, or even higher, as it has been shown that\npatients with previous ARV exposure have significantly higher rates of\nPDR as compared to those without any ARV exposure \\[ 8 \\]. The disparity\nbetween these regions observed in our study could be explained by the\ndifference in the performance of the control indicators, and therefore\nsuggests that decision making should consider local realities. Similar\nto other studies, we observed higher rates of PDR in urban areas as\ncompared to rural areas \\[ 14 , 20 \\]. This is consistent with longer\nand more extensive use of ART in urban areas as compared to rural areas\nand, therefore, higher rates of PDR. Though this appears comforting for\nrural settings, it calls for continuous monitoring and preventive\nmeasures in these settings, as ART scale-up continues to be more\neffective over the years, extensively covering rural localities.\n\nIn terms of resistance according to the antiretroviral drug classes,\nNNRTIs had higher resistance rates (12.4%, including 7.9% resistance to\nfirst-generation NNRTIs, namely Efavirenz and Nevirapine) as compared to\nother ARV classes. Several other studies, both in sub-Saharan Africa and\nelsewhere, also found a high prevalence of pre-treatment drug resistance\nto NNRTIs, with the predominant mutation being the K103N, as also found\nin our study \\[ 14 , 18 , 19 , 21 \\]. The reasons for this predominance\nof resistance to NNRTIs are multiple: the former use of NVP as\nmonotherapy in the context of prevention of mother-to-child transmission\nin Cameroon as well as in many other countries; long-term use of EFV\nand/or NVP as the driving arm of first-line treatment protocols; the low\ngenetic barrier of NNRTIs; and the ease of transmission of the K103N\nmutation and its good fitness. These are all elements that can explain\nthis predominance of resistance to NNRTIs \\[ 22 , 23 \\]. We observed a\ngreat disparity in the prevalence of resistance to first-generation\nNNRTIs between the regions, specifically the Far North and East regions\npresenting WHO's critical threshold of 10%. This thus merits transition\nto DTG-based regimens or the use of genotypic resistance testing in\nchoosing an optimal regimen for treatment initiation. This high\nprevalence of resistance to NNRTIs in these two regions could be\nexplained by the social and security situation that prevails there, with\nthe movements of populations coming from neighbouring countries that\nshare borders with these regions. This suggests that the implementation\nof the WHO recommendations (transition to Dolutegravir for all patients\non initiation of treatment) should be considered a priority in these\nregions. We found similar trends in PDR drug resistance mutations during\nthe study period. This is similar to other studies, showing similar\npatterns of PDR essentially driven by NNRTI mutations, followed by NRTI\nmutations and, to a lesser extent, PI/r \\[ 14 , 20 \\]. The similar\npatterns in these DRMs between 2014 and 2019 could be to the fact that\nthe same ART regimens were used for the first- and second-line\nthroughout the period of 2014--2019 (first-line: NNRTI-based;\nsecond-line: PI/r-based). Nonetheless, these trends may change\nsubstantially with the transition to Dolutegravir-based regimens in the\ncoming years. Therefore, though current rates of PDR to integrase strand\ntransfer inhibitor (INSTI) are low in our context (0% in INSTI naïve\npatients), a continuous update of this data is necessary for the\nlong-term success of ART programs \\[ 17 , 24 \\].\n\nGenetic diversity results from recombination phenomena and errors that\noccurred during RNA reverse transcription due to the low level of\nfidelity of the reverse transcriptase enzyme. Phylogenetic analysis of\nthe pol region sequences showed great genetic variability in the\npopulation, with a total of 18 viral strains, all belonging to HIV-1,\nwith a predominance of the recombinant forms. The recombinant form\nCRF02_AG remains the predominant strain in our context, as demonstrated\nin several other studies \\[ 14 , 25 \\]. The predominance of this subtype\ncould be due to a biological advantage that this subtype has over the\nother subtypes, in particular, its great replicative capacity. We did\nnot find any significant association between the viral strain and the\npre-treatment resistance, thus suggesting that the initiation of\nantiretroviral treatment in our context could be conducted independently\nof the virus strain that the patient harbors. This great genetic\ndiversity constitutes a real challenge for the diagnosis, treatment, and\ndevelopment of an HIV vaccine, the major part of diagnostic tools and\ntreatment being designed on majority subtypes in developed countries, in\nparticular subtype B \\[ 26 \\].\n\nAnalysis of resistance mutations, in particular the determination of\nviral susceptibility scores for each antiretroviral molecule, made it\npossible to compare the effectiveness of two standard first-line\nprotocols. One of these protocols, TDF + 3TC + EFV, was the preferred\nfirst-line protocol used up until 2019 in Cameroon, and the other, TDF +\n3TC + DTG, was recommended recently by the WHO, given evidence of\nincreasing levels of pre-treatment drug resistance to NNRTIs. Our\nfindings show a predicted significant superiority of the TDF + 3TC + DTG\nprotocol, both nationally and regionally. This observation reinforces\nthe idea that Dolutegravir remains the molecule of choice for first-line\nprotocols and thus suggests an acceleration of the transition process,\nstrongly recommended by the WHO. However, in addition to its efficacy,\nDolutegravir is a controversial molecule due to some described side\neffects. Preliminary findings from the Tsepamo study suggested an\nincreased risk of neural tube defects in children of pregnant women\nreceiving DTG, with other studies reporting increased weight gain with\nDTG use \\[ 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 \\]. However, recent data upon completion of\nthe Tsepamo study refuted this link between DTG and neural tube defects\n\\[ 31 , 32 \\]. Nonetheless, in this context of transition to first-line\nprotocols based on Dolutegravir, implementing a pharmacovigilance\nmechanism within our management program remains crucial to better\nunderstand the risks of its use in real conditions.\n\nAlthough this study provides us with an overview of pre-treatment HIV\ndrug resistance in Cameroon, it nevertheless has certain limits, the\nmain ones being that the technique used for carrying out resistance\ntests only detected a resistance mutation if it represented at least 20%\nof the circulating population. Thus, the real prevalence of resistance\nwould be better evaluated if we had a high-throughput sequencing\ntechnique (1% detection threshold), a platform unavailable in our\ncontext. Elsewhere, with the Test and Treat strategy, CD4 T lymphocyte\nlevels and baseline viral loads are unavailable at the time of ART\ninitiation. This data would have made it possible to assess the\nresistance profile as a function of the patient's immune status and\nviremia, which could have been important for a better description of\nthis population. Finally, the lack of data from two of the ten regions\nof Cameroon, namely, the South and Adamawa, somewhat undermines the\npower of the study.\n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions\n\nIn Cameroon, the level of EFV/NVP PDR suggests a superior efficacy of\nTLD over TLE as an initial ART regimen. Moreover, the significant\ndisparities in PDR levels according to regional settings is a call for\nurgent interventions within regions with PDR above the critical\nthreshold (Far North and East) and for stratified monitoring of TLD\neffectiveness. Current evidence suggests interventions should be\nregardless of gender and viral strains in RLS.\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThis research was funded by the Chantal BIYA International Reference\nCenter for Research on HIV and AIDS Prevention and Management (CIRCB)\nthrough the annual budget plan allocated to the Virology Laboratory,\nfunding code \"PTA 2014-2021\".\n\n\n## Data Availability Statement\n\nSequence data are available on GenBank under the accession numbers\nGenBank MK702015-MK702057 , MK867695-MK867757 , and MK995397-MK995457 .\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 35061671\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Materials and methods\nWe analyzed 1071 HIV-1 pol-gene fragment sequences (2253–3369 bp) from patients who were initiating or reinitiating first-line ART in six EECA counties, i.e., Armenia (n = 120), Azerbaijan (n = 96), Belarus (n = 158), Russia (n = 465), Tajikistan (n = 54), and Uzbekistan (n = 178), between 2017 and 2019. HIV Pretreatment DR (PDR) and drug resistance mutation (DRM) prevalence was estimated using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database. The PDR level was interpreted according to the WHO standard PDR survey protocols. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database and subsequently confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Transmission clusters were determined using Cluster Picker.\nResults\nAnalyses of HIV subtypes showed that EECA, in general, has the same HIV genetic variants of sub-subtype A6, CRF63_02A1, and subtype B, with different frequencies and representation for each country.\nThe prevalence of PDR to any drug class was 2.8% in Uzbekistan, 4.2% in Azerbaijan, 4.5% in Russia, 9.2% in Armenia, 13.9% in Belarus, and 16.7% in Tajikistan. PDR to protease inhibitors (PIs) was not detected in any country. PDR to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) was not detected among patients in Azerbaijan, and was relatively low in other countries, with the highest prevalence in Tajikistan (5.6%). The prevalence of PDR to nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was the lowest in Uzbekistan (2.8%) and reached 11.1% and 11.4% in Tajikistan and Belarus, respectively.\nGenetic transmission network analyses identified 226/1071 (21.1%) linked individuals, forming 93 transmission clusters mainly containing two or three sequences. We found that the time since HIV diagnosis in clustered patients was significantly shorter than that in unclustered patients (1.26 years vs 2.74 years). Additionally, the K103N/S mutation was mainly observed in clustered sequences (6.2% vs 2.8%).\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance and the genetic analysis of HIV-1 sequences from patient samples.

We determined the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity in Bulgaria during 2012--2020 using polymerase sequences from 1053 of 2010 (52.4%) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. Sequences were analyzed for DRM using the WHO HIV SDRM list implemented in the calculated population resistance tool at Stanford University. Genetic diversity was inferred using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetics. Cluster detection and characterization was performed using MicrobeTrace. The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%). Most (34/60, 56.7%) of the SDRMs were present in transmission clusters of different subtypes composed mostly of male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC), including a 14-member cluster of subtype B sequences from 12 MMSC and two males reporting heterosexual contact; 13 had the L90M PI mutation and one had the T215S NRTI SDRM. We found a low SDRM prevalence amid high HIV-1 diversity among ART-naive patients in Bulgaria during 2012--2020. The majority of SDRMs were found in transmission clusters containing MMSC, indicative of onward spread of SDRM in drug-naive individuals. Our study provides valuable information on the transmission dynamics of HIV drug resistance in the context of high genetic diversity in Bulgaria, for the development of enhanced prevention strategies to end the epidemic.\n\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity using sequences from ART-naive individuals.

The mean age of the participants was calculated to be 32.21 yr and over half of the patients (n=16) were male and the mean time of HARRT use was 47.69 months.  Standard first-line regimen in Iran is comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI);  drug resistance mutations for the 3 classes of ART (NNRTI, NRTI, and PI) were observed and 4 samples showed resistance to all of them.\nRationale: The paper mentions the patients got standard treatment, and the evidence indicates the presence of mutations associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, suggesting that individuals in the study had received these drug classes prior to sample sequencing.\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI\n\nPMID: 36016383\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be transmitted via parenteral, sexual, or vertical exposure routes. The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals. This retrospective study examines genetic sequences and clinical parameters like CD4+ T cell counts and viral load to understand the epidemiological and genetic characteristics of HIV-1 in the pediatric population in Rio de Janeiro.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 36146776\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: Monitoring HIV-1 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs) is important for disease surveillance. Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing. It focuses on the analysis of HIV-1 sequences and the identification of recombinant forms and drug resistance mutations.\nAnswer: No"}

We\ncompared viral suppression and associated factors in treatment-naïve\npeople living with HIV (PLHIV) starting DTG- based versus NNRTI-based\nART.\n\n### Methods\n\nWe compared virological suppression at 12 months, after treatment\ninitiation in the two cohorts of participants aged ≥15 years, initiating\nDTG- and NNRTI-based ART. Drug resistance was assessed among\nparticipants with viremia ≥50 copies/mL on DTG.\n\n### Results\n\nViral suppression was achieved for 165/195 (85%) and 154/211 (73%)\nparticipants in the DTG- and NNRTI- cohorts, respectively ( *P* =\n0.003). DTG-based ART was associated with \\>2 times the odds of viral\nsuppression versus NNRTI-based ART (adjusted odds ratio, 2.10 \\[95%\nconfidence interval {CI}, 1.12--3.94\\]; adjusted risk ratio, 1.11 \\[95%\nCI, 1.00--1.24\\]). HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing (GRT) before ART\ninitiation was done in 14 of 30 viremic participants on DTG, among whom\nnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), NNRTI, and protease\ninhibitors resistance was detected in 0 (0%), 2 (14%) and 1 (7%),\nrespectively. No resistance was found in the 2 of 30 participants with\navailable GRT at the time of viremia ≥50 copies/mL.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nVirological suppression at 1 year was higher in participants initiating\nDTG- versus NNRTI-based ART. In those with viremia ≥50 copies/mL on\nDTG-based ART, there was no pretreatment or acquired resistance to the\nDTG co-administered NRTIs, although the number of samples tested was\nsmall.\n\n## METHODS\n\n### Study Design and Setting\n\nThis is a retrospective, observational study nested within the Kilombero\nand Ulanga antiretroviral cohort (KIULARCO), a prospective cohort of\nPWH. The cohort includes patients seen at the Chronic Diseases Clinic of\nIfakara, the care and treatment center for PWH of the Saint Francis\nReferral Hospital, located in rural southeastern Tanzania. The cohort\nwas established in 2005 and captures comprehensive demographic and\nclinical data, including ART use and monitoring, comorbidities, and\ntreatment outcomes, with details described previously \\[ 14 , 15 \\].\n\n### Study Population\n\nTwo groups of PWH aged ≥15 years attending KIULARCO were included in the\nanalysis: (1) treatment-naive patients initiating NNRTI-based ART\nbetween 16 December 2016 and 15 December 2017 (referred to as the NNRTI\ncohort) and (2) treatment-naive patients initiating DTG-based ART\nbetween 16 March 2019 and 15 September 2020 (referred to as the DTG\ncohort). The separation of periods ensured that no patient in the NNRTI\ncohort would have been switched to a DTG-based regimen by the time of\noutcome assessment, which could have had an impact on VL results.\n\nWe excluded patients initiating protease inhibitor (PI)--based therapy\nin both periods, patients starting NNRTI-based ART between 16 March 2019\nand 15 September 2020, treatment-experienced patients (assessed in the\nbaseline questionnaire by asking if they had ever received ART before),\nthose not starting ART during the given time periods, and those without\nwritten informed consent to KIULARCO ( Figure 1 ). Reasons for excluding\npatients starting PI-based ART was that this is not the usual first-line\ntherapy in Tanzania. Similarly, those initiating NNRTI-based ART during\nDTG rollout were excluded as they were only few and would have only\nstarted on this therapy due to specific criteria.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nParticipant flowchart. Abbreviations: ART, antiretroviral therapy; c/mL,\ncopies per milliliter; DTG, dolutegravir; KIULARCO, Kilombero and Ulanga\nAntiretroviral Cohort; LTFU, lost to follow-up; NNRTI, nonnucleoside\nreverse transcriptase inhibitor; VL, viral load.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nData for patient demographics, routine clinical information, and\nlaboratory data as well as information on ART were extracted from\nOpenMRS, the KIULARCO electronic medical record system. As per routine\ncare and according to the Tanzania National Guidelines for the\nManagement of HIV and AIDS, patients receive a VL measurement at 6 and\n12 months after treatment start, and once yearly thereafter for those\nwith a VL \\<1000 copies/mL. At the same time point as VL measurements,\nblood samples are stored in a biobank at −80°C for research purposes.\n\n### Laboratory Measurements\n\nVL measurement was done using the Abbott Real-time m2000 HIV-1 Assay\n(Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, Illinois), with a reportable range of\n40--10 000 000 copies/mL for blood plasma. For this study, we performed\nHIV-1 genotypic resistance testing (GRT) from biobanked samples for\nthose with an HIV VL ≥50 copies/mL. In addition, HIV-1 GRT was performed\non samples available prior to treatment initiation for cases with a VL\n≥50 copies/mL at 12 months using cryopreserved samples, to determine PDR\nbefore ART initiation in the DTG cohort.\n\nGRT was performed using a validated in-house polymerase chain reaction\n(PCR) protocol to determine the HIV-1 drug resistance--associated\nmutations for reverse transcriptase, protease, and INSTI \\[ 16 , 17 \\].\nIn brief, RNA was extracted from 150 μL of plasma using the PureLink\nViral RNA/DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific), according\nto the manufacturer\\'s protocol. RNA extracts were retrotranscribed and\namplified using the HIV-1 Genotyping Kit Amplification Module (Applied\nBiosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific). A direct sequencing reaction was\ndone using 6 overlapping primers, and assembly program (BioEdit 7.2) was\nused for sequence analysis. Mutations were interpreted according to the\nStanford University\\'s HIV Drug Resistance Database Program version 9.2\n( http://hivdb.stanford.edu ). Drug resistance mutations conferring low,\nintermediate, or high-level resistance were considered. The reported\nprotease and reverse transcriptase sequences are available in GenBank\n(accession number OQ627458-OQ627474 ).\n\n### Definitions\n\nViral suppression was defined as \\<50 copies/mL and viremia as defined\nas ≥50 copies/mL, at 1 time-point measurement, and virological failure\nwas defined as ≥1000 copies/mL after a minimum of 6 months on ART, based\non 2 consecutive VL measurements in 3 months (with adherence support\nfollowing the first VL test), in line with the most recent WHO\nguidelines \\[ 18 \\]. Loss to follow-up (LTFU) was defined as being\n\\>60 days late for a scheduled visit.\n\nTuberculosis was recorded if, within 3 months from enrollment, acid-fast\nbacilli or a positive Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale,\nCalifornia) from sputum or an extrapulmonary site was documented, or if\nantituberculosis drugs with an *International Classification of\nDiseases, Tenth Revision* ( *ICD-10* ) code or clinical signs suggestive\nof tuberculosis were present. Unlikely tuberculosis was defined as no\nprescription of antituberculosis drugs and no diagnosis of tuberculosis\nby *ICD-10* . For other cases, an indeterminate tuberculosis status was\nstated and treated as missing data.\n\n### Study Outcomes\n\nThe primary outcome was viral suppression at 12 months, allowing for a\ntime window of 5--15 months with a preference for the measurement\nclosest to 12 months after treatment start. The secondary outcomes of\nthis study were prevalence of PDR and acquired resistance among patients\npresenting with viremia on DTG-based ART (defined as the presence of\nresistance-associated mutations), plus, side effects and pregnancy\noutcomes in the DTG cohort.\n\n### Statistical Methods\n\nDemographic characteristics were summarized using frequencies and\npercentages. We descriptively compared baseline characteristics between\nparticipants with and without a VL result at 12 months. The proportion\nof participants with viral suppression in the DTG and NNRTI cohorts was\ncompared using a χ ^2^ test. Factors associated with 12-month viral\nsuppression were determined using logistic regression models, reporting\nodds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We also calculated\nadjusted risk ratios (aRRs) after fitting the multivariable model with\nstandard errors estimated using the delta method \\[ 19 \\]. The\nmultivariable model incorporated the following covariates, which were\nselected a priori: age, sex, marital status, disclosure of HIV status,\neducation level, distance in kilometers of residence from the clinic,\nbody mass index (BMI), HIV WHO stage, CD4 cell count, tuberculosis\nstatus, and cohort (DTG-based or NNRTI-based ART). No model selection\nwas done. We performed a sensitivity analysis restricting VL measurement\nto a time window of 9--15 months from treatment start. The analysis was\nrepeated under the assumption that those LTFU were not virally\nsuppressed, as such participants are likely to be off treatment and\ntherefore not suppressed.\n\nThe prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance, the proportion of patients who\ndiscontinued DTG-based ART, and the proportion of women who conceived\nwhile on DTG-based ART and their pregnancy outcomes were described\ndescriptively. All analyses were performed using Stata version 15\n(StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).\n\n### Ethical Considerations\n\nWritten informed consent of patients willing to participate in KIULARCO\nare obtained at registration. This study received ethical approval from\nthe University of the Witwatersrand Human Research Ethics Committee\n(Medical) Clearance Certificate No. M210714. Yearly ethical approval for\ndata and sample collection as well as analysis is sought from the\nIfakara Health Institute institutional review board (IHI/IRB/No16-2006)\nand the Health Review Committee of the National Institute for Medical\nResearch of Tanzania (NIMR/HQ/R.8c/Vol.I/378).\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Study Population and Baseline Characteristics\n\nThere were 436 and 466 patients in the DTG and NNRTI cohorts,\nrespectively ( Figure 1 ). The combined median age in both cohorts was\n38 years (interquartile range \\[IQR\\], 30--45 years). In the DTG and\nNNRTI cohorts, 280 (64%) and 300 (65%) patients were female, 292 (67%)\nand 263 (57%) were married/cohabiting, 290 (72%) and 318 (79%) had\ndisclosed their HIV status, and 51 (12%) and 106 (25%) were resident\n≥50 km from clinic, respectively. The clinical parameters were broadly\ncomparable within the 2 groups, with a normal BMI (18.5--25 kg/m ^2^ )\nin 230 (57%) and 259 (62%), a WHO stage III/IV in 107 (25%) and 166\n(39%), a CD4 count of ≥350 cells/mL in 142 (37%) and 134 (34%), and\ntuberculosis coinfection in 33 (8%) and 52 (11%) participants,\nrespectively ( Table 1 ).\n\nWe compared patients with and those without VL tests at 12 months and\nfound them to be broadly comparable with the exception of those with\n12-month VL more likely to have disclosed their HIV status (309 \\[81%\\]\nvs 301 \\[70%\\]) and to be resident \\<1 km from clinic (210 \\[54%\\] vs\n213 \\[45%\\]), and less likely to be HIV WHO stage III/IV (115 \\[29%\\] vs\n159 \\[35%\\]) and to have a CD4 count ≥350 cells/µL (118 \\[31%\\] vs 151\n\\[38%\\]). Those without 12-month VL were more likely to have missed\nbaseline characteristic measurements compared to those with VL (\nSupplementary Table 1 ).\n\n### Virological Outcome\n\nVL data at 12 months after ART initiation were available for 195 of 436\n(45%) and 211 of 466 (45%) participants in the DTG and NNRTI cohorts,\nrespectively ( Figure 2 ). Among those with VL results available, viral\nsuppression was achieved for 165 of 195 (85%) and 154 of 211 (73%)\nparticipants in the DTG and NNRTI cohorts, respectively ( *P* = .003).\nFor those with viremia in the DTG and NNRTI cohorts, 25 of 30 (83%) and\n42 of 57 (74%) had a VL 50--999 copies/mL and 5 of 30 (17%) and 15 of 57\n(26%) had VL ≥1000 copies/mL, respectively. At 1 year following ART\ninitiation, 108 of 436 (25%) patients in the DTG cohort and 143 of 466\n(31%) in the NNRTI cohort were LTFU ( Figure 1 ). Assuming those LTFU\nwere not virally suppressed, 165 of 303 (55%) and 154 of 353 (44%)\nachieved viral suppression in the DTG and NNRTI cohorts, respectively (\n*P* \\< .001).\n\nFigure 2.\n\nVirologic outcome at 12 mo after initiation of reverse transcriptase\ninhibitor-- and dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy in\ntreatment-naive participants. Abbreviations: ART, antiretroviral\ntherapy; DTG, dolutegravir; NNRTI, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitor; VL, viral load (copies/mL).\n\n### Factors Associated With Virological Suppression\n\nResults of the univariable and multivariable analyses are shown in Table\n2 . DTG-based versus NNRTI-based ART was independently associated with\nimproved viral suppression (adjusted odds ratio, 2.10 \\[95% CI,\n1.12--3.94\\]; aRR, 1.11 \\[95% CI, 1.00--1.24\\]). In addition, the\nfollowing factors were independently associated with viral suppression (\nTable 2 ): being separated/divorced/widowed (and to some extent\nmarried/cohabiting) versus never married, higher education level, and\nhigher (worse) HIV WHO stage.\n\nIn sensitivity analysis restricting VL measurements to a time window of\n9--15 months including 59 of 436 (14%) and 133 of 466 (29%) patients in\nthe DTG and NNRTI cohorts, ART regimen was not associated with viral\nsuppression (aRR, 2.12 \\[95% CI, .82--5.49\\]), compared to using the 5-\nto 15-month VL window above ( Supplementary Table 2 ).\n\n### HIV-1 Drug Resistance--Associated Mutations\n\nFor patients with viremia at 12 months after starting DTG-based ART,\nblood plasma samples prior to treatment initiation were available for 25\nof 30 (83%) patients. Of those, 14 of 25 (56%) samples were successfully\nPCR amplified and sequenced for PDR determination. In 2 of 14 (14%)\nsamples we detected 1 mutation each, which were V108I and K103N\nmutations, known to be associated with NNRTI resistance. Additionally, 1\nof 14 (7%) patients harbored the Q58E mutation, which is a PI-associated\nresistance mutation. No mutations associated with NRTI were detected (\nTable 3 ).\n\nBlood plasma samples at VL ≥50 copies/mL were available for 13 of 30\n(43%) patients. PCR amplification and sequencing for determination of\nacquired and/or persisting HIV-1 drug resistance--associated mutations\nwas successful for only 2 of 13 (15%) patients. No mutations associated\nwith HIV-1 drug resistance were detected ( Table 3 ).\n\n### Side Effects and Pregnancy Outcomes\n\nSeven of 436 (2%) patients discontinued DTG-based ART due to side\neffects. Of the women initiating DTG-based ART, 33 (12%) women had a\ndocumented pregnancy either at treatment initiation or during the\nfollow-up period; 25 (76%) of those delivered a live-born infant with no\nobvious birth defect, 3 (9%) had a reported abortion, 1 (3%) mother had\na stillbirth, and 4 (12%) were LTFU before giving birth.\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nIn this prospective real-world study from a rural setting in eastern\nAfrica, we compared the virological outcome of DTG- and NNRTI-based ART\nin treatment-naive PWH. We found higher virological suppression rates on\nDTG-based ART compared to NNRTI-based ART at 12 months after initiation.\nThe documented difference in viral suppression in our cohort was even\nhigher than in the first trials evaluating DTG-containing first-line\nregimens in African settings \\[ 20 , 21 \\]. The cohorts are comparable\nas there were no major changes regarding the clinical practice\nguidelines during the time frames; specifically, ART initiation was\nrecommended for all, regardless of CD4 count, since October 2016 in\nTanzania, and VL testing was recommended to monitor treatment success.\n\nFurthermore, we assessed for the presence of PDR among patients with\nviremia ≥50 copies/mL at months after ART initiation in the DTG cohort.\nNo PDR to NRTI was detected; PDR to NNRTI and PIs was rare, albeit the\nsubgroup for available sequencing data was small. Thus, the observed\nelevated VL might be due to delayed suppression after treatment start or\npoor adherence with treatment interruption \\[ 22 \\]. Analyses from RCTs\nand real-life data have shown good virological suppression of DTG-based\nART among patients with PDR to NNRTIs \\[ 23--25 \\]. In our study we did\nnot systematically screen for PDR to DTG, as resistances to INSTIs would\nnot be expected during the beginning of DTG-based ART rollout, as\nreported in recent studies in similar settings \\[ 26--28 \\]. Moreover,\nof 30 patients with detectable VL in the DTG-based cohort, 25 (83%) had\nlow viremia (ie, 50--999 copies/mL), which may be a result of\nmomentarily subtherapeutic drug levels due to suboptimal adherence \\[ 22\n\\].\n\nThe fact that we found no HIV-1--associated drug resistance mutations in\nPWH with a detectable VL on a DTG-based ART is reassuring. However,\nthese results are mitigated by the fact that genotypic results were only\navailable for a small subgroup of participants. While the high\nproportion of patients with low viremia at 12 months in the DTG-based\ncohort might be due to early measurement with an expected further\ndecrease, it remains worrisome, as most patients are expected to\nsuppress VL within 3 months and low viremia due to poor adherence may\nsubsequently lead to viral failure and emergence of resistance \\[ 29 \\].\nEven though resistance to DTG is still uncommon in this setting,\nevidence from other studies now shows that resistance to DTG may emerge\nover time, particularly following accumulation of resistance to the NRTI\nbackbone \\[ 30--33 \\]. Hence, vigilance and monitoring of low viremia\namong PWH on DTG-based therapy remain important.\n\nOf note, more than half of the patients in both cohorts had no VL\nresults in the given time span. One reason is the high rate of LTFU,\nwhich accounted for 56% and 44% of those without VL results in the NNRTI\nand the DTG-based cohorts, respectively. This rate is comparable to a\nprevious report from the period 2005--2016 from the same clinic with\nLTFU rates of 41% in the first year after enrollment \\[ 34 \\]. Though\nsome of these patients may have silently transferred and collected\nmedication from another clinic, and therefore have a suppressed VL,\nothers are likely to have suboptimal adherence or stopped medication\naltogether. Importantly, viral suppression rate in the sensitivity\nanalysis was still higher in the DTG-based cohort compared to the\nNNRTI-based cohort. Regardless, the high rate of LTFU in this rural\nsetting in SSA remains a major concern of the treatment cascade and\nurgently needs a better understanding of patients' needs and adequate\ninterventions \\[ 35 \\].\n\nBeing on DTG-based ART was an important factor associated with improved\nviral suppression, which is in line with existing data from RCTs that\nshowed excellent pharmacokinetic profile and tolerability of DTG, rapid\nviral suppression, and fewer side effects compared to NNRTIs in\ntreatment-naive and -experienced patients \\[ 36--38 \\]. Similarly, in\nthis study, we observed very few patients who discontinued DTG due to\nside effects. However more data on an extended time span is required and\nis the aim of future studies. Other factors associated with viral\nsuppression were a higher education level and being\nseparated/divorced/widowed. While other studies have indicated high odds\nof viral failure in clients who did not disclose their HIV status \\[ 39\n\\], we found no evidence of such an association. The association of\nvirological suppression with advanced WHO clinical stages in our study\nmight be due to patients feeling worse and therefore more likely to\nadhere to medication and also receiving closer care and monitoring (and\ntherefore better adherence) \\[ 11 \\]. However, this outcome might also\nbe affected by a reporting bias, as these patients are attending the\nclinic and are tested more frequently.\n\nAs in other settings, in the first year of DTG rollout in Tanzania,\nwomen of childbearing potential were given the choice to start either\nDTG-based or NNRTI-based ART, based on informed consent according to the\nWHO guidelines \\[ 40 \\]. Nevertheless, a number of women became pregnant\nwhile on DTG. Reassuringly, we did not document obvious birth defects in\nthe 33 women with live births during the study period. One stillbirth\nand 3 abortions of unknown reasons were reported. While the numbers of\nthis study are too low to draw firm conclusions, it is important to\nobserve uptake among women and pregnancy outcomes as a large\nobservational study from 11 LMICs has shown substantial disparities in\nthe uptake of DTG affecting females of childbearing age \\[ 41 \\]. The\nbenefit of rapid viral suppression in pregnant women is of utmost\nimportance to avoid viral transmission to their newborns.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study addressing virological\noutcomes among treatment-naive patients initiating DTG-based ART in\nTanzania under programmatic conditions. Our study has several\nlimitations. Most importantly, a large proportion of patients in both\ncohorts had no VL result in the given time span due to a high rate of\nLTFU. Another major limitation is unmeasured confounding as these are\nobservational data. Furthermore, many patients who were in active care\nalso had no VL result. Most likely reasons were stockout of reagents or\nprocedural challenges during VL testing implementation. In both\ntimespans, national guidelines recommended VL testing to monitor\ntreatment success. The lack of available VL results might have led to\noverestimating the rates of viral suppression. Another limitation is\nthat that many blood samples were not available for drug resistance\ntesting. Furthermore, there was significant PCR amplification failure,\nespecially in those with a low VL, which might be due to poor sample\nstorage quality. Finally, all genotypic data were obtained through\nstandard Sanger sequencing; rates of HIV-associated drug resistance\nmutations would possibly be higher if ultra-sensitive HIV-1 drug\nresistance testing by next-generation sequencing had been used.\n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nOur results underline the benefit of programmatic uptake of DTG-based\nART in LMICs. We did not find pretreatment resistance to the DTG\nco-administered NRTIs nor acquired resistance among viremic patients on\nDTG-based ART, although the number of samples tested was small.\nContinuous monitoring of pretreatment and acquired resistance under\nprogrammatic condition during the rollout of DTG-based first-line is of\nutmost importance. LTFU remains high and needs further attention as it\njeopardizes control of the HIV epidemic.\n\n\n***Data availability* .** The data that support the findings of this\nstudy are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable\nrequest.\n\n***Financial support* .** KIULARCO receives funds from the Ministry of\nHealth and Social Welfare of Tanzania, the government of the Canton of\nBasel, the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, the Ifakara\nHealth Institute, and the US Agency for International Development\nthrough the local implementer.

Standard first-line regimen in Iran is comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI);  drug resistance mutations for the 3 classes of ART (NNRTI, NRTI, and PI) were observed and 4 samples showed resistance to all of them.\nRationale: The paper mentions the patients got standard treatment, and the evidence indicates the presence of mutations associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, suggesting that individuals in the study had received these drug classes prior to sample sequencing.\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI\n\nPMID: 20029816\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: To examine the efficacy of these drugs in Cameroon, where diverse non-B HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant viruses predominate, the reverse transcriptase (RT) viral sequences in patient plasma were analyzed for the presence of mutations that confer drug resistance. Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon.\nRationale: The paper doest not mention in vitro drug susceptibility data or phenotypic data.

However, it has been difficult\nto determine if minor mutations occur in the same genome or in different\nvirions using Sanger sequencing and short-read sequencing methods.\nOxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing may improve antiretroviral\nresistance profiling by allowing for long-read clustering.\n\nMethods\n\nA new ONT sequencing-based method for profiling DRMs in HIV quasispecies\nwas developed and validated. The method used hierarchical clustering of\nlong amplicons that cover regions associated with different types of\nantiretroviral drugs. A gradient series of an HIV plasmid and 2 plasma\nsamples was prepared to validate the clustering performance. The ONT\nresults were compared to those obtained with Sanger sequencing and\nIllumina sequencing in 77 HIV-positive plasma samples to evaluate the\ndiagnostic performance.\n\nResults\n\nIn the validation study, the abundance of detected quasispecies was\nconcordant with the predicted result with the *R* ^2^ of \\> 0.99. During\nthe diagnostic evaluation, 59/77 samples were successfully sequenced for\nDRMs. Among 18 failed samples, 17 were below the limit of detection of\n303.9 copies/μL. Based on the receiver operating characteristic\nanalysis, the ONT workflow achieved an F1 score of 0.96 with a cutoff of\n0.4 variant allele frequency. Four cases were found to have quasispecies\nwith DRMs, in which 2 harbored quasispecies with more than one class of\nDRMs. Treatment modifications were recommended for these cases.\n\nConclusions\n\nLong-read sequencing coupled with hierarchical clustering could\ndifferentiate the quasispecies resistance profiles in HIV-infected\nsamples, providing a clearer picture for medical care.\n\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### Sample Collection\n\nA total of 77 plasma samples, collected from 70 male and 7 female\npatients ages 18 to 68, were obtained from the Queen Mary Hospital in\nHong Kong between 2002 and 2014 ( Supplemental Table 1 ).\n\n### RNA Extraction and Long Region Amplification\n\nFrozen plasma sample (approximately 1.5 mL) was thawed on ice for 2\nhours, then resuspended and centrifuged at 20 800 *g* for 1.5 hours at\n4°C. Supernatant was removed. Viral RNA in the pellet was extracted\nusing QIAamp Viral RNA Kit, according to the manufacturer\\'s\ninstructions. Then, 8 μL of extracted RNA was subjected to DNA removal\nusing ezDNase™, reverse transcription with LunaScript RT SuperMix (5X),\nand amplification targeting the long genomic region (NC_001802.1:\n1413--7363, amplicon length: 5951 base pairs) using the reagents and\ncycling conditions described in Supplemental Table 2 . Amplicons were\npurified with 0.5×AMPure XP beads (for nanopore sequencing) or with\nQIAquick PCR Purification Kit (for Illumina) and quantified with Qubit®\ndsDNA HS Assay Kits.\n\n### Sanger Sequencing\n\nProtease and reverse transcriptase nucleotide sequences were determined\nby our in-house Sanger sequencing-based genotypic resistance test ( 18\n), whereas the sequences of integrase were characterized by another\nin-house Sanger sequencing protocol developed by our team ( 19 ).\n\n### Nanopore Sequencing\n\nFor nanopore sequencing, libraries were constructed with SQK-LSK109,\nEXP-NBD104, and EXP-NBD114, following the official protocols of Native\nBarcoding Amplicons. At most 12 libraries were pooled and sequenced on\nONT GridION for 48 hours using the SUP basecalling mode, with the\nminimum quality score for read filtering as 10 and the modified\ndemultiplexing setting (trim_barcodes = \"on\", require_barcodes_both_ends\n= \"on\", detect_mid_strand_barcodes = \"on\", min_score = 85).\n\n### Illumina Sequencing\n\nFor Illumina sequencing, 1 ng of amplicon was used for library\npreparation with the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit and IDT® for\nIllumina® DNA/RNA UD Indexes Set A, Tagmentation. The quality and\nquantity of the library were assessed with the Bioanalyzer and QIAseq\nLibrary Quant Assay Kit, respectively. Libraries were pooled and\nsequenced with the MiSeq Reagent Kit Nano V2 on the Illumina MiSeq\nSystem (250 × 2 cycles).\n\n### Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction\n\nThe viral load (copies per μL) of each RNA sample was determined using\nthe GeneSig Standard Real-time PCR Detection Kit for HIV-1 and the Oasig\nLyophilized OneStep qRT-PCR MasterMix Kit.\n\n### Limit of Detection\n\nLimit of detection (LOD) was defined as the minimum input viral\nconcentration (copies/μL) required for having 0.9 probability to reach\nthe average depth of coverage (DP). For LOD analysis, 2 DP cutoffs, 50×\nand 1500×, were employed. A minimum DP of 50× is sufficient for variant\ncalling in a quasispecies with high confidence in nanopore sequencing\ndata when using Clair-ensemble embedded in ClusterV ( 20 ). However, a\nDP of 1500× was recommended to detect 30 quasispecies with an abundance\nas low as 0.03. A sample that passed the DP was set as 1, while a sample\nthat did not pass was set as 0. Logistic regression was used for\nestimating the LOD.\n\n### Bioinformatics\n\nONT sequencing reads were used to iteratively cluster quasispecies and\ncall variants using ClusterV ( Supplemental information S1 and S2 ) to\ngenerate abundance, DRM profiles, and clinical reports for each\nquasispecies based on the input of the alignment files and Browser\nExtensible Data files ( Supplemental Fig. 1 ). In brief, sequencing\nreads were mapped to the HIV reference genome NC 001802.1 (2.24-r1122)\nusing Minimap2; reads with an defective genome or that failed to cover\nthe targeted region were excluded. Then variants were called using\nClair-ensemble and used as markers for iterating hierarchical clustering\nprocesses in order to identify HIV quasispecies within a sample. A\nconsensus sequence for each quasispecies was generated based on its\nvariants. Finally, an ARV resistance report was generated using\nSierraPy, based on the consensus sequences of all quasispecies found\nwithin a sample.\n\nIllumina data was first aligned to HIV genome NC_001802.1 with bwa mem\n(v1.15.1) ( 21 ). Unmapped reads and secondary alignments were filtered\nwith the SAMtools view function (with --F 3844) ( 22 ). Variant calling\nof the filtered alignments was performed using Clair3 ( 20 ) with\nIllumina mode (v0.1-r11, with --haploid_sensitive, \\--no_phasing_for_fa\nflag).\n\n### Validation of Clustering Performance in the ONT Workflow\n\nOne HIV plasmid (pHIV-1_pr-V82A, provided by the European Virus\nArchive---Global), and 2 clinical samples (Sample ID: KB2061 and\nKB2979), each of which has a unique quasispecies with a median VAF \\>\n0.9 ( Supplemental Table 3 ), were used to evaluate the clustering\nperformance of ClusterV. An in silico simulation data set was prepared\nby mixing the HIV plasmid and 2 clinical samples (Sample ID: KB2061 and\nKB2979) in various combinations (10:10:80, 33:33:33, 80:20:0, 50:50:0,\n5:95:0). Also, a gradient series of HIV plasmid and KB2061 amplicons was\nprepared in triplicate with the following ratios: 95:5, 90:10, 85:15,\nand 80:20. The abundance of quasispecies determined by ClusterV was\ncompared with the corresponding mixing ratio; *R* ^2^ was used for\nevaluating their linear relationship.\n\n### Evaluation of the Diagnostic Performance of the ONT Sequencing Workflow\n\nTo evaluate the diagnostic performance of the ONT workflow, the reported\namino acid mutations (including AVR resistance associated and non-AVR\nrelated mutations) and their associated genomic variants were compared\nwith those reported in Sanger and Illumina sequencing, with the\nassistance of Integrative Genome Viewer ( 23 ). Illumina genomic\nvariants with a VAF greater than 0.03 ( 13 , 24 -- 26 ) were considered\nvalid. To determine the accuracy of ONT mutations, it was considered\ntrue if they were concordant with Sanger sequencing. In cases where\nthere was a discrepancy with or no Sanger reference available, the ONT\nmutations were compared with Illumina results, and they were considered\ntrue if the results were concordant. If the ONT mutations were\ndiscordant or could not be validated with Illumina, they were considered\nfalse or inconclusive, respectively ( Fig. 1 ).\n\nFig. 1.\n\nA flowchart to demonstrate how amino acid mutations found in the ONT\nworkflow were classified as true or false mutations.\n\nOpen in new tab Download slide\n\nAmino acid mutations exclusively found in Sanger but not in ONT were\nalso validated with Illumina. Concordant mutations were considered true\nwhile discordant mutations were considered false ( Fig. 1 ). The F1\nscore \\[2× (precision × recall) / (precision + recall)\\] was used for\nevaluating performance of variant calling and ARV resistance detection.\nTo determine the VAF cutoff, an overall VAF of each amino acid mutation\nwithin a sample was calculated. Then a receiver operating characteristic\n(ROC) analysis was performed; the VAF with the highest sensitivity and\nthe lowest false-positive rate was regarded as the cutoff value.\nStatistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism (v9.4.1) and\nMicrosoft Excel.\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Validation of Clustering Performance in the ONT Workflow\n\nThe number of detected quasispecies by ClusterV was concordant with the\nexpected number of quasispecies in the gradient series and in silico\nsimulation data set; the predicted abundance was in a linear\nrelationship with the true abundance ( Supplemental Table 4 ). The *R*\n^2^ for HIV plasmid and KB2061 gradient series were both 0.996 (\nSupplemental Figs. 2A and B ), while the *R* ^2^ for the in silico\nsimulation data set was 0.9939 ( Supplemental Fig. 2C ). The median VAF\nfor variants found in each quasispecies was 0.89 or above ( Supplemental\nTable 4 ).\n\n### The Variant Calling and Diagnostic Performance of the Targeted Sequencing ONT Workflow\n\nFifty-nine out of 77 plasma samples were successfully sequenced using\nthe ONT workflow, while sequencing failures occurred with the remaining\n18 samples due to low viral load (\\<250 copies/μL), except for one\nsample KB2992 (745.36 copies/μL). Sanger sequencing results covering\nprotease and reverse transcriptase (RT) (amino acid position 1--401)\nwere available for 54 samples, except for 5 samples (KB0097, KB0270,\nKB0548, KB0552, and KB0553) covering RT amino acid position 1 to 335;\nresults for integrase were only available in 16 samples. Illumina data\nwas not available in 16 samples with insufficient sample volume; 43\nsamples were sequenced by Illumina as a result.\n\nOne HIV quasispecies was found in 28/59 samples (47.45%), followed by 2\nquasispecies in 10 samples (16.94%) and 3 quasispecies in 6 samples\n(10.17%), and more than 3 quasispecies were found in 19 samples\n(25.42%). Subtypes B (38.98%) and CRF01_AE (35.59%) were dominant in the\nsample set, followed by CRF07_BC (11.29%). Three samples, KB2974,\nKB2980, and KB2998, carried a mixture of subtypes ( Supplemental Table\n5A ).\n\nA total of 4104 amino acid mutations were found in 59 samples in the ONT\nworkflow ( Fig. 2A , Supplemental Table 5B ). Of these, 2200 mutations\nand 271 mutations were respectively concordant and discordant with\nSanger sequencing, whereas 1506 (36.7%) mutations could not be validated\ndue to the unavailability of Sanger sequencing results. The remaining\n127 (3.1%) mutations were classified as unknown amino acid mutations due\nto complicated insertion-deletion variants. Among the 271 discordant and\n1506 nonvalidated mutations, 1153 (28%) and 222 (5%) mutations were\nconcordant and discordant with Illumina, respectively, and 49 (1%)\ndiscordant with Sanger could not be validated with Illumina. The\nremaining 353 mutations (9%) could not be validated because of\nunavailable Sanger and Illumina results.\n\nOpen in new tab Download slide\n\nOpen in new tab Download slide\n\nFig. 2.\n\n(A), The distribution of the amino acid mutations (n = 4104) found in\nONT and their agreements with Sanger and Illumina; (B), the agreement\nbetween unique amino acid mutations (n = 135) in Sanger and Illumina;\n(C), the distribution of AVR associated amino acid mutations (n = 33)\nfound in ONT with the agreement with Sanger or Illumina before the\ncutoff (VAF = 0.4) and (D), after the cutoff; (E), The ROC analysis of\nvariant calling performance in the ONT workflow. Each data point on the\ncurve displayed sensitivity and false-positive rate. The overall VAF\ncutoff of 0.4 is highlighted in red.\n\nAdditionally, 135 amino acid mutations were uniquely found in Sanger\nsequencing ( Fig. 2B ), with 27 of the mutations concordant with\nIllumina, 62 mutations discordant, and 46 mutations that could not be\nvalidated because of unavailable Illumina results. To conclude, the\nprecision and recall of the ONT workflow were 93.79% (2200 +\n1153)/(2200 + 1153 + 222) and 99.2% (2200 + 1153)/(2200 + 1153 + 27),\nrespectively, and the F1 score was 0.964. A ROC curve was generated (\nFig. 2E ; Supplemental Table 6 ) with the area under the curve of 0.903.\nIn this case, the VAF cutoff for ONT sequencing was 0.4 with the true\nmutation rate of 0.9072 and false mutation rate of 0.1712.\n\nWith the ONT workflow, 33 DRMs were found in 22 samples ( Fig. 2C ;\nSupplemental Table 7A ). By comparing with the Sanger sequencing\nresults, 26 out of 33 DRMs (78.8%) were considered as true mutations, 6\nDRMs (18.2%) were discordant, and one DRM (3%) was inconclusive. When\ncomparing the 6 discordant DRMs with Illumina, one was considered as a\ntrue mutation, 4 were considered as false mutations, and one was\ninconclusive. Additionally, the 1 DRM without a reference Sanger result\nwas also considered as a true mutation since it was concordant with\nIllumina.\n\nThere were 3 DRMs with mixed alleles uniquely found in Sanger (\nSupplemental Table 7B ). With reference to the results of Illumina\nsequencing, one DRM was considered a true mutation while the other 2\nwere considered false mutations. The precision and the recall of the\ndiagnostic performance were 0.875 (28/32) and 0.965 \\[28/(28 + 1)\\],\nrespectively, and the F1 score was 0.918.\n\nWith the cutoff of 0.4 from the ROC analysis, a total of 7 mutations\nwith an overall VAF below the cutoff were excluded ( Fig. 2D ). The\nprecision and the recall of the diagnostic performance were 0.96 (24/25)\nand 0.96 \\[24/(24 + 1)\\], and the F1 score was 0.96.\n\n### Detection of the Mutations with the Quasispecies\n\nWith the ONT workflow, 4 samples were found harboring different patterns\nof DRMs in different quasispecies. For example, all of the quasispecies\n(KB2070_1 and KB0270_2) in the sample KB0270 ( Fig. 3A , B , and C )\nharbored mutation G73S in the protease gene, as well as mutations M41L,\nS68G, and M184V in the RT gene, conferring a potentially low-level\nprotease inhibitors resistance (atazanavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir,\nsaquinavir, and nelfinavir) and a low-level to high-level of NRTI\nresistance (abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, and lamivudine).\nHowever, mutation T215F was exclusively found in the quasispecies\nKB0270_2 (abundance = 32.27%), conferring an additional low-intermediate\nresistance level of NRTI (abacavir, azidothymidine, stavudine,\ndidanosine, and tenofovir).\n\nFig. 3.\n\nTwo examples demonstrating different DRM patterns in different\nquasispecies in the same samples. (A), the example in KB0270 with the\nabundance; (B), different resistance patterns and (C), resistance level\nfound in different quasispecies; (D), the example in KB2987 with the\nabundance, (E), different resistance patterns, and (F), resistance level\nfound in different quasispecies.\n\nOpen in new tab Download slide\n\nAnother example, KB2987 ( Fig. 3D , E , and F ), mutation V106I in RT,\nconferring a potentially low resistance level of NNRTI (doravirine,\netravirine, nevirapine, and rilpivirine), was found in 5 out of 7\nquasispecies (KB2987_2, KB2987_3, KB2987_4, KB2987_5, and KB2987_7) with\na total abundance of 63.2%. However, G190E, a minor mutation (overall\nVAF of 0.063) that conferred intermediate-high resistance of NNRTI\n(doravirine, efavirenz, nevirapine, rilpivirine, and etravirine), was\nuniquely found in the quasispecies KB2987_6 (abundance = 6.79%). This\nminor mutation was also detected by the Illumina method.\n\n### Limit of Detection\n\nTwo logistic regression models were constructed based on the 2 DP\ncutoffs: 50× and 1500× ( Supplemental Fig. 3; Supplemental Table 8 ).\nThe area under the curve for the cutoffs DP = 50× and DP = 1500× were\n0.8795 and 0.853, respectively. By calculating the viral load\n(copies/μL) required for having a probability 0.9 of reaching the DP =\n50× and DP = 1500×, the LODs were 303.9 copies/μL and 1930.6 copies/μL,\nrespectively.\n\n### Time to Report and Operation Cost\n\nFor a batch of 12 plasma samples, 5 hours and another 3.5 hours were\nrespectively required for viral RNA extraction and real-time PCR on the\nfirst working day. On the next day, the amplicons were purified and\nenzymatically converted to a library (3 hours). After the 48-hour\nsequencing, data analysis was performed on the fourth working day, which\nlasted for 2 hours generally (based on a computer with 2 12-core Intel\nXeon Silver 4116 processors with 126GB RAM running in 10 threads). An\nadditional 6 hours was required for a computer with 32 GB RAM, a CPU of\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2678 v3 or equivalent, and a clock speed of 2.5\nGHz or equivalent. Therefore, the time to report for this ONT workflow\nwas 4 working days ( Fig. 4 ). The running cost per sample was \\$120.93\n(12 samples per flow cell) and \\$88.02 (24 samples per flow cell) (\nSupplemental Table 9 ).\n\nFig. 4.\n\nThe time to report utilizing the ONT workflow for direct AVR resistance\ndetection in HIV.\n\nOpen in new tab Download slide\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe clinical significance of detecting low-frequency DRMs in HIV remains\ncontroversial. Some studies have shown a marginal correlation between\ndetecting minor DRMs in treatment-naïve patients and the clinical\nfailure of first-line ARV therapy ( 27--29 ). However, these studies\ndetected low-frequency DRMs based on short sequence reads with a read\nlength of no more than 150 bp. One common limitation of short-read\nsequencing is that researchers cannot analyze viral variants at the\nsingle genome level, making it difficult to determine whether these\nminor mutations are linked with each other on the same genome or occur\nseparately in different quasispecies virions.\n\nLinked dual-class resistance mutations occurring in a single genome have\nbeen previously associated with an increased risk of virological failure\n( 30 ). As shown in Fig. 5 , variants with a VAF of 0.33 could originate\nfrom the same genome, conferring quasispecies coresistance to multiple\nclasses of ARV. In this scenario, the strain is likely to survive even\nunder combined ARV therapy and become a predominant strain, eventually\nresulting in virological failure. Conversely, if the DRMs are separately\ncarried by different viral particles, they can still be suppressed by\nthe other effective ARV class under highly active antiretroviral therapy\nwithout requiring treatment modification. Therefore, whether\nlow-frequency DRMs eventually lead to therapy failure depends on whether\nthey are present on the same viral genome.\n\nFig. 5.\n\nSchematic diagram of long-read nanopore sequencing coupled with\nhierarchical clustering for the detection and assignment of\nlow-frequency DRMs to different HIV quasispecies of a sample. The DRMs\nwith VAFs of 0.33 could be attributed to 2 different scenarios. In the\nfirst scenario, 3 different DRMs are separately harbored in 3 different\nquasispecies. Under a standard treatment regimen with combined ARV, the\nquasispecies with only a single class of DRM could be suppressed by the\nother classes of drugs. In scenario 2, a quasispecies, which accounts\nfor one-third of the viral population, harbors 3 DRMs on the same\ngenome, conferring the viral strain coresistance to 3 different classes\nof ARV. The strain is likely to survive even under combined ARV therapy\nand become a predominant strain, eventually resulting in virological\nfailure.\n\nOpen in new tab Download slide\n\nHowever, different classes of DRMs located distantly apart from each\nother cannot be revealed by Sanger and short-read sequencing, and their\nlinkage cannot be determined. Our long-read sequencing (\\>6 kbp in\nlength) coupled with hierarchical clustering can accurately link DNA\nmutations to different quasispecies, addressing the limitations of\nSanger and Illumina sequencing. This provides a more precise prediction\nof the clinical outcome for samples with low-frequency DRMs. For\ntreatment-naïve patients, detecting drug-resistant minorities before\ncommencing treatment can guide the choice of ARV and reduce the chance\nof treatment failure.\n\nIn this study, 4 out of 59 (6.8%) samples were found to have\nquasispecies with DRMs. Notably, 2 cases harbored quasispecies with more\nthan one class of DRMs, which could potentially lead to virological\nfailure of first-line ARV therapy. In the highlighted example of KB0270,\n2 quasispecies carrying DRMs associated with resistance to protease\ninhibitors and NRTI were identified. In another example, KB2897 was\nfound to have a mutation that can cause intermediate- to high-level\nresistance to 5 NNRTIs in one of the quasispecies with low abundance.\nTreatment modifications were recommended for these cases. However, both\npatients were lost to follow-up and thus clinical outcome could not be\ndetermined.\n\nIn addition to quasispecies, long-read sequencing and clustering can\nidentify distant subtypes and their corresponding drug resistance\nprofiles in cases of HIV superinfection. HIV superinfection occurs when\na patient is infected with one HIV strain and then becomes infected with\nanother distant HIV strain. Some studies have reported the\nsuperinfection of susceptible HIV strains with resistant strains or vice\nversa ( 31 , 32 ). In one special case, a patient infected with one\nresistant strain was then infected with another resistant strain ( 33 ).\nIn this study, hierarchical clustering allowed the identification of\nmixed subtypes in some cases. For example, sample KB2974 was a mixture\nof Subtype B and Subtype CRF01_AE, while only Subtype CRF01AE was\ndetected by Sanger sequencing. Another example, sample KB2980, was a\nmixture of Subtype CRF07_BC and Subtype CRF01_AE, while only CRF07_BC\nwas identified by Sanger sequencing. Sample KB2998 was a mixture of\nSubtype CRF07_BC and Subtype B + C. Both of them could be detected by\nSanger and ONT sequencing. These results supported the occurrence of HIV\nsuperinfection with different subtypes in these 3 cases. Using\nhierarchical clustering, the sequences of different subtypes could be\nseparated and isolated into individual genomes for phylogenetic\nanalysis, enabling epidemiological investigation and transmission\ntracing.\n\nAnother benefit of hierarchical clustering is to avoid misinterpreted\namino acids caused by mismatching multiple nucleotide substitutions at\nmixed alleles in the same genetic code. Hierarchical clustering can\ncluster the reads by selecting variants with near VAF peaks prior to the\nfinal variant calling in different quasispecies ( Supplemental Table 10\n). For example, mutation A71I (ATT encoding for isoleucine) in protease\nin sample KB2019 was reported in Sanger sequencing, but the genetic\ncodes A C T (encodes for theronine) and G TT (encodes for valine) were\nobserved in 2 different quasispecies using ONT ( Fig. 6A ). Another\nexample is that V111M (ATG encoding for methionine) in RT in KB2987 was\nreported by Sanger sequencing; however, ATA (encodes for isoleucine) and\nGTG (encodes for valine) were found in different quasispecies of the\nsample ( Fig. 6B ).\n\nFig. 6.\n\nTwo examples (upper) KB2019 and (lower) KB2987 demonstrated how the\namino acid mutations were misinterpreted in Sanger, comparing with the\ngenetic codes found in ONT and Illumina (in red square).\n\nOpen in new tab Download slide\n\nHierarchical clustering can be computationally demanding, especially\nwhen processing a large batch of long-read sequencing data and\nconstructing a distance matrix. To simplify the process and reduce the\ncomputational burden, the clustering strategy employed in this study was\nbased on multiple rounds of selecting variants with near VAF peaks\nrather than a distance matrix between the sequences. This approach\nminimized the need for constructing a distance matrix and simplified the\nhierarchical clustering process. The lower adoption cost of the nanopore\nsequencer and the simplified design of hierarchical clustering could be\nof benefit as a workflow in clinical centers that require short analysis\ntime and low computer specifications. Furthermore, the reduced\ncomputational burden of our approach compared to traditional\nhierarchical clustering methods makes it more accessible for adoption in\nresource-limited settings. In addition, the simplified design of our\nworkflow allows for efficient and rapid analysis of large amounts of\ndata, making it an ideal solution for clinical applications where timely\nresults are critical.\n\nThe studies of minor variant detection in a gradient series and an in\nsilico simulation data set demonstrated that the ONT workflow was able\nto detect the true minor variants. A direct linear relationship between\nthe reported abundance in the ONT workflow and the corresponding true\nabundance was obtained, though the reported abundance was generally\nslightly lower than the gradient ratios. However, from the ROC analysis\nwith the 59 plasma samples, the false-positive rate was still high (\\> =\n0.2) for the overall VAF of less than 0.35. As a result, a cutoff of 0.4\nwas set to keep the balance between the lower false-positive rate\n(\\<0.2) and the higher true positive rate (approximately 0.9). With this\ncutoff, the F1 score of ARV resistance detection was increased from\n0.918 to 0.96 as the false mutations with overall VAF below the cutoff\nwere filtered. Of note, 2 mutations with overall VAF above the cutoff\nwere discordant with Sanger. The mutation N348I in KB2971 could not be\nvalidated with unavailable Illumina results, while mutation K70R in\nKB2016 was considered as false because of its discordance with Illumina.\nThe reason was still unclear but possibly due to the low viral load in\nKB2016 and KB2971 (104.79 copies/μL and 98.79 copies/μL, respectively)\nthat occasionally amplified only one of the quasispecies and dominated\nthe overall VAF. To avoid missing true mutations in the marginal overall\nVAF (\\<0.4), these mutations could be reported as possibly true and\nshould be confirmed.\n\nThere were several limitations in this study: ( *a* ) longitudinal\nsamples were not available, and temporal changes in the DRMs of each\nquasispecies could not be determined; ( *b* ) although Illumina was\nemployed to validate the clustering performance, the VAF might be varied\ndue to the inability to filter defective HIV genomes ( 34 ) in Illumina,\nwhile such genomes were removed in the ONT workflow; ( *c* ) the\nclustering performance was validated with the gradient series and in\nsilico simulation data set, but validation with other long-read\nsequencing technologies such as Pacific Biosciences may be beneficial; (\n*d* ) the F1 score might be vulnerable to any discordance within this\ncohort due to a small number of resistant samples; and ( *e* ) the\nClusterV algorithm relies on accurate calling of variants. A somatic\nvariant calling is more suitable for performing variant calling of\nquasispecies in HIV than the germline variant calling, However, a\nsomatic small variant caller was not available for ONT data.\n\nIn conclusion, an ONT workflow was developed for detecting ARV\nresistance in HIV with direct sequencing of vRNA extracted from plasma\nsamples. It reached an F1 score of 0.96 with the recommended overall\nVAF. This workflow also demonstrated that long-read sequencing\ntechnologies and hierarchical clustering could synergistically reveal\nthe detailed resistance profile by linking the ARV resistance to\ndifferent quasispecies. Overall, this approach provides a more\ncomprehensive clinical picture to better enable medical decision-making.\n\n\n\n\n## Research Funding\n\nThis study was supported by the AIDS Trust Fund of Hong Kong (Ref no.\nMSS 299 R); R.Luo received support from ONT and partial support from GRF\n(17113721).\n\n\n## Data Availability\n\nClusterV is open-source software (BSD 3-Clause license), hosted by\nGitHub at https://github.com/HKU-BAL/ClusterV .\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 20718620\nQuestion ID: 16\nQuestion: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: We also analyzed the amino acid sequences for the presence of drug resistance mutations according to the last update of the WHO list for the surveillance of drug resistance mutations in antiretroviral-naive patients (SDRM version 2009, http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/WHOResistanceList.html).

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals.

To the best of our knowledge this\ncombination has not been studied before.\n\n### Methods\n\nThis open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted in\ntreatment-experienced people with HIV who had HIV-RNA \\< 47 copies/mL\nfor at least two years. Patients received either tenofovir alafenamide\nplus dolutegravir combination (26 patients) or a standard three-drug\nregimen (29 patients). The primary outcome was the proportion of\npatients maintaining HIV-RNA \\< 47 copies/mL during 48 weeks, and the\nsecondary outcomes were CD4 cell count changes, the adherence rate, and\nadverse drug reactions, all over 48 weeks of study.\n\n### Results\n\nHIV viral load remained undetectable (HIV-RNA \\< 47 copies/mL) during\nthe 48 weeks of the study in both arms. The absolute CD4 cell count\nchange was not significant between the two groups. The overall\nproportion of adverse effects in each group was comparable. The rate of\nadherence to treatment was acceptable in both groups, and no significant\ndifference was observed.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nTreatment simplification with tenofovir alafenamide plus dolutegravir\nregimen as maintenance therapy was non-inferior in terms of efficacy and\nsafety compared to the standard triple therapy.\n\n### Graphical abstract\n\nComparing efficacy of antiretroviral therapy\n\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study design and participants\n\nThis study was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials\n(IRCT20191005044984N1, registered at 2019--12-21) and conducted as an\nopen-label randomized non-inferiority trial. PLWH admitted to the HIV\nclinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex (affiliated to Tehran\nUniversity of Medical Sciences) were evaluated for study enrollment.\n\n### Eligibility criteria\n\nHIV-positive adults (≥ 18 years old) who were on ART, with undetectable\nviral load (HIV-RNA \\< 47 copies/mL), and CD4 \\> 200 cells/µL in the\npast two years were enrolled. Good general condition, normal laboratory\ntests, no AIDS-related event (opportunistic infection or cancer), any\nhistory of mutations against INSTIs and NRTIs, agreement for signing the\ninformed consent form, and adequate adherence to the treatment based on\nthe patient's medical record, were other inclusion criteria.\n\nExclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation, hepatitis B or C\nco-infections, using any treatment with significant interaction with\nstudy drugs, and renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 ml/min) or\nhepatic failure (Child-Paugh category C).\n\n### Study process and random allocation\n\nEligible patients were assigned to the intervention or control group\nusing a simple randomization method. Random numbers were created by a\ncomputer program and sent to the satellite pharmacy of the HIV clinic.\nThe triple-drug regimen was changed to dual therapy including TAF 25 mg\ntablet (Altafir®, Tadbir Kalaye Jam) plus dolutegravir 50 mg tablet\n(Dolutegravir®, Aurobindo) once daily in the intervention group (TAF\nplus DTG), and the conventional triple-drug regimens in the control\ngroup (3DR). The duration of intervention was 48 weeks for the both\ngroups. A third---party assignment was used for the allocation\nconcealment.\n\n### Follow-up and adherence\n\nPhysical examination and laboratory tests (viral load, CD4 count, and\nthe routine laboratory tests including blood chemistry, glucose level,\nlipid profile, urinalysis, renal and hepatic function tests) were\nconsidered for all patients at the beginning of the study, weeks 24 and\n48. Patients in the intervention group had one more follow-up visit on\nweek 8 to perform an additional viral load test. HIV-1 RNA levels were\nquantified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays with a detection\nlimit of 47 copies/ml. Patients\\' routine laboratory tests were\nperformed according to the clinic visit schedule every six months.\n\nDrug adverse events (AEs) were defined as any new drug-related clinical\nsymptoms occurring at least three months after starting ART.\nAdditionally, ART-related laboratory toxicities were recorded as new\nevents comparing with the baseline tests.\n\nAdherence to treatment was assessed according to patients' self-report\nat all study visits according to the clinic schedule \\[ 20 \\].\n\nTreatment failure was defined as any virological failure (HIV-RNA \\> 50\ncopies/ml), disease progression, life-threatening ART side effects, or\ndeath during the study period and at week 8, 24 or 48 \\[ 21 \\].\n\nThe primary outcome of the study was the proportion of patients\nmaintaining a viral load \\< 47 copies/mL at week 8, 28 or 48 and the\nsecondary outcomes were changes in CD4 cell count, incidence of drug\nadverse effects, and adherence to the treatment.\n\n### Ethical considerations\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from each participant before the\ninitiation of the study. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee\nof Tehran University of Medical Sciences (IR.TUMS.TIPS.REC.1398.087).\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS® version 26 (IBM North\nAmerica, New York, NY, USA). The Shapiro--Wilk normality test was used\nto confirm the normality and homogeneity of variances. Data are\npresented as mean (SD) or frequency (percent).\n\nUnpaired t-tests and Chi squared were applied for comparing two groups.\nAlpha level of significance was set at *P* \\< 0.05.\n\n\n\n## Results\n\nA total of 102 PLWHs were screened for eligibility, of which 17 persons\ndid not meet the inclusion criteria. Finally, 85 patients were randomly\nassigned to receive TAF plus DTG regimen ( *n* = 43) or to continue the\nprevious 3DR ( *n* = 42), (Fig. 1 ).\n\nFig. 1\n\nConsort flowchart of the study\n\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were\ncomparable between the groups. The median value of CD4 cell count at\nbaseline was above 700 cells/mm3, and all participants had undetectable\nviral load (HIV-RNA \\< 47 copies/mL) over the last three years (Table ​\n(Table1 1 ).\n\nThe baseline ART regimen of most patients in both groups included two\nNRTIs and one NNRTI.\n\nHIV viral load remained undetectable (HIV-RNA \\< 47 copies/mL) at weeks\n8, 24, and 48 in both groups, and no virological failure was detected\nduring the study.\n\nAs detailed in Table ​ Table2, 2 , average changes in CD4 cell count were\nnot significantly different between the two groups during 48 weeks.\nAlthough, according to Fig. 2 in TAF plus DTG group, median of CD4 cell\ncount was increased during 48 weeks while in 3DR group, it reached the\nstate of plateau.\n\nFig. 2\n\nCD4 cells count change during the study. CD4 mean changes trend at\nbaseline, week 24 and week 48 for each treatment group. As the diagram\nshows, in TAF plus DTG group median CD4 cell count was increased during\n48 weeks while in 3DR group, it reached the state of plateau\n\nNo significant changes in serum creatinine, liver enzymes, lipid profile\nand blood sugar were detected and the laboratory parameters were within\nthe normal range during the study (Table ​ (Table3). 3 ). However, in the\nintervention group, a significant increase in body weight (2.2 kg) at\nthe end of week 48 was detected that was statistically significant\ncompared to the control group ( *p* = 0.006).\n\nDuring the study, the ART regimen of three patients ( *n* = 3, 10.3%)\nwas changed in the 3DR group due to drug-related side effect ( *n* = 1,\n3.4%), complaints of multiple pills per day ( *n* = 1, 3.4%) and the\nlaboratory changes ( *n* = 1, 3.4%), while, in TAF plus DTG, there was\nno case of changing ART during the study period.\n\nSelf-reported adherence was slightly better in the intervention group\nbut did not differ significantly (96.2% vs 82.8%, *p* = 0.05).\n\nDetails of the drug-related adverse effects are summarized in Table ​\nTable4. 4 . Generally, there was no significant difference between the\ngroups in terms of ART-related complications. Most of the adverse\neffects were mild to moderate. There was no severe event that led to a\ndiscontinuation of treatment in 2DR arm.\n\n\nData are presented as frequency (percent) during the study protocol.\nAEs- 3 months refers to the occurrence of drug-related complications in\nthe first three months of starting ART. Adverse effects (AEs)\n\nThe main complaints of patients in the TAF plus DTG group were anxiety,\nrestlessness, insomnia, nausea, and vomiting (Table ​ (Table4). 4 ). In\nthe four patients (15.4%), a transient rise in serum creatinine\noccurred, which was temporary and improved during the study time without\nany intervention. Renal function tests were repeated and proteinuria was\nnot detected.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn the current study, the efficacy and safety of TAF plus DTG as a new\n2DR were compared with 3DRs. To the best of our knowledge, this 2DR has\nnot been previously studied and is the first trial of ART simplification\ncarried out in Iran among virologically suppressed PLWH. Both TAF and\nDTG are potent ARV agents with high resistance barrier. These factors\nare important to consider in communities where access to resistance\ntests is limited. At week 48, both regimens showed comparable efficacy\nand safety in this setting.\n\nIn previous studies, 2DRs including TDF, compared with the common\nstandard regimens. In COOL study, efavirenz (EFV) plus TDF regimen\ncompared with EFV plus TDF/3TC regimen and the 2DR failed to meet\nnon-inferiority \\[ 16 \\].\n\nIn the Kalead study, Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) plus TDF compared with\nLPV/r plus two non---TDF NRTIs in naïve population, that high\ndiscontinuation rates among both groups (2DR 42% and 3DR 44%\nrespectively) were observed \\[ 17 \\].\n\nVarious DTG-based 2DRs have been examined in both treatment-naïve and\ntreatment-experienced PLWHs. In the SIMPL'HIV trial, one of the most\nrecent studies, DTG plus emtricitabine (FTC) was non-inferior to the\nstandard triple ART in terms of efficacy through a 48-week evaluation\namong virologically suppressed PLWH. Also, improvement in the quality of\nlife and comparable safety were reported \\[ 22 \\].\n\nThe 2DR designed in our study had similarities with the SIMPL'HIV trial\nin terms of ART classes. On the other hand, according to the high\nresistance barrier of tenofovir, it seems that TAF plus DTG, is potent\nenough, especially in communities with limited access to resistance\ntests and high rate of FTC resistance.\n\nIn recent years, many studies have shown the effectiveness and safety of\nDTG-based two-drug regimens (DTG-2DRs). In a real word study, DTG-2DRs\npaired with darunavir (DRV) or rilpivirine (RPV) indicates a low rate of\nvirological failure in viral suppressed PLWH \\[ 23 \\].\n\nIn addition, a recent meta-analysis of 96-week data from real-word\nevidence on DTG plus Lamivudine (3TC) or RPV in virologically suppressed\nPLWH confirmed a low rate of treatment failure with a high rate of\nvirological suppression \\[ 13 \\].\n\nSimilar to previous studies, in our study, all patients in both groups\nhad undetectable viral load during the 48-week study and no virological\nfailure was detected.\n\nIn the SIMPL'HIV trial, although the average change in CD4 cell count in\npatients receiving DTG plus FTC was slightly higher than of patients in\nthe 3DR group, but no any difference in CD4 cells count change was\ndetected at week 48 compared with the baseline value ( *p* = 0.334) \\[\n22 \\]. Similarly, there was no significant difference in CD4 cell count\nchange between the two groups in this study.\n\nPatients tolerated TAF plus DTG regimen well and there was no serious\ndrug side effect that led to treatment discontinuation. A noteworthy\nevent in the TAF plus DTG arm was a rise in serum creatinine without\nproteinuria in the four patients (15.4%) at the beginning of the\ntreatment that returned to the baseline level after 1 to 3 months\nwithout any intervention. As we know, dolutegravir inhibits the organic\ncation transporter 2 at the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubular\nnephron cells and subsequently, mild rise in serum creatinine is\nsuspected without any renal toxicity \\[ 24 \\].\n\nIn the ADVANCE study, a large randomized trial in South Africa, the\nefficacy and safety of dolutegravir plus each of the tenofovir\nformulations (TDF, TAF) and FTC were compared with the standard triple\ntherapy (TDF/FTC/EFV). This research showed non inferiority in terms of\nviral suppression with desirable safety in all arms. The unexpected\nresults were greater weight gain, risk of metabolic syndrome, and\nclinical obesity in patients taking TAF/FTC + DTG than TDF/FTC + DTG\nregimen particularly in women at week 192 \\[ 25 \\].\n\nIn recent years, several studies have been published regarding the\nweight gain of ART containing TAF \\[ 26 -- 28 \\]. A recently published\nreview article indicated that DTG-based 3DRs lead to more weight gains\nthan other standard ART regimens and likewise, weight gain is more with\nTAF compared to other backbone ARVs \\[ 29 \\].\n\nIn a real-word analysis among PLWH who receiving INSTs, increase in\nweight and body mass index were common and appeared to be greater with\nTAF compared with other nucleosides \\[ 30 \\]. Several biological\npathways responsible for excess weight gain with INSTs have been\nproposed which need confirmation \\[ 31 \\].\n\nIn this study, a weight gain of about 2.2 kg was observed in patients in\nTAF plus DTG group, which is consistent with the findings of previous\nstudies. During the project, no laboratory change in lipid profile or\nfasting blood glucose in patients in TAF plus DTG arm was detected and\nno significant difference between the two groups was noted. It was\nsuggested that TAF may be associated with an elevation in serum lipids,\nand conflicting results exist about increased risk of cardiovascular\nevents in comparison to TDF. However, the risk of osteoporosis and\nnephrotoxicity has been shown to be higher with TDF compared with TAF \\[\n27 , 32 \\]. Considering that the weight gain in patients in the TAF plus\nDTG group was not accompanied by hyperlipidemia, it does not seem to\nincrease cardiovascular risk.\n\nOne of the major issues regarding the treatment of chronic diseases is\nthe economic impact of drugs. Antiretrovirals are afforded by\ngovernments in most countries. The high cost of the treatment has a\nnegative impact on public health. Reducing pill burden and daily doses\nare effective in improving adherence to the treatment \\[ 20 \\].\nLong-term results reinforce the good tolerability of DTG-2DR (DTG-3TC)\nfor ART-experienced PLWH \\[ 15 \\]. In our study, patients receiving DTG\nplus TAF showed favorable adherence and there was no case of changing or\ndiscontinuing the treatment; these patients also tolerated the treatment\nwell.\n\n## Limitations\n\nSmall sample size is the main limitation of the current study. The\ncoincidence of patient enrollment and the outbreak of COVID-19 in Iran\nwas the main reason for the small number of participants in this study.\nAlthough patients were followed for 48 weeks, longer follow-up is\nrecommended to detect any probable long-term consequences.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this study, the non-inferiority of TAF plus DTG as a new design 2DR\nwas shown in terms of efficacy and safety compared to 3DR. Further\nstudies are needed to confirm these findings in future studies with\nadequate sample size and longer follow-up periods.\n\n\n## Funding\n\nThis study was supported by Tehran University of Medical Sciences\n(IR.TUMS.TIPS.REC.1398.103).\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe datasets used and analyzed during the current study are available\nfrom the corresponding author upon request.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 37112915\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with virological suppression on DTG plus 3TC and DTG plus RPV at weeks 24 and 48. The secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients who experienced the protocol-defined loss of virological control by week 48; changes in immune status in terms of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio; the rate, incidence, and reasons for discontinuation of treatment over the 48-week study period; and safety profiles at weeks 24 and 48.\nRationale: The evidence discusses the study's focus on treatment outcomes and comparisons but does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility data being reported.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 26149983\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is an investigational prodrug of the HIV-1 nucleotide reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NTRTI) tenofovir (TFV), with improved potency and drug delivery properties over the current prodrug, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). TAF is currently in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Phase 1 and 2 studies have shown that TAF was associated with increased peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) drug loading and increased suppression of HIV-1 replication compared to treatment with TDF. In this study, selection of in vitro resistance to both TAF and the parent compound, TFV, led to the emergence of HIV-1 with the K65R amino acid substitution in RT with 6.5-fold-reduced susceptibility to TAF. Although TAF is more potent than TFV in vitro, the antiviral susceptibilities to TAF and TFV of a large panel of nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant mutants were highly correlated (R2 = 0.97), indicating that the two compounds have virtually the same resistance profile when assessed as fold change from the wild type. TAF showed full antiviral activity in PBMCs against primary HIV-1 isolates with protease inhibitor, nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), or integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance but reduced activity against isolates with extensive NRTI resistance amino acid substitutions.

We evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of once-daily dispersible and immediate-release FDC abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine in young children with HIV.\n\n### Methods\nIMPAACT 2019 was an international, phase I/II, multi-site, open-label, non-comparative dose confirmation study of abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine in children <12 years. Participants were enrolled across five weight bands (WBs): those 6-<25 kg received abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine (60/5/30 mg) dispersible tablets (3–6 depending on body weight), and those 25-<40 kg received the immediate-release tablet (600/50/300 mg). At entry, participants were ART-naïve or ART-experienced and virologically suppressed on stable ART for ≥6 months. Dose confirmation was based on pharmacokinetic and safety criteria in the first 5–7 participants in each WB through Week 4; all participants were followed through Week 48. We present results for the primary objectives to assess pharmacokinetics, confirm dosing, and evaluate safety through 24 weeks across all WBs.\n\nFindings\nFifty-seven participants were enrolled (46% female; 65% Black, 32% Asian). Within each WB (6-<10kg, 10-<14 kg, 14-<20 kg, 20-<25 kg, and ≥25 kg), the geometric mean (CV%) dolutegravir area under the concentration time curve over the 24-hour dosing interval (AUC0–24h) was 75.9 (33.7%), 91.0 (36.5%), 71.4 (23.5%), 84.4 (26.3%), and 71.8 (13.9%) μg∙h/mL; dolutegravir concentration at 24 hours post-dose (C24h) was 0.91 (67.6%), 1.22 (77.5%), 0.79 (44.2%), 1.35 (95.5%), and 0.98 (27.9%) μg/mL; abacavir AUC0–24h was 17.7 (38.8%), 19.8 (50.6%), 15.1 (40.3%), 17.4 (19.4%), and 25.7 (14.6%) μg∙h/mL; and lamivudine AUC0–24h was 10.7 (46.0%), 14.2 (23.9%), 13.0 (15.6%), 14.5 (16.6%), and 21.7 (26.2%) μg∙h/mL. Pharmacokinetic targets and safety criteria were met within each WB, and thus dosing of abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine was confirmed at the originally selected doses. Ninety-five percent of participants were treatment-experienced and all remained virologically suppressed (<200 copies/mL) through week 24. Virologic suppression was achieved in 2/3 ART-naïve participants by week 24. There were no grade 3 or higher adverse events related to abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine and no discontinuations due to toxicity through week 24. Both FDC formulations were well-tolerated.\n\n### Interpretation\nDosing of abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine was confirmed in children weighing 6-<40 kg, and both FDC formulations were safe, well-tolerated, and efficacious through 24 weeks of treatment. These findings support global efforts to expand the availability of FDC abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine to children with HIV.\n\n### Funding\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Institute of Mental Health, and ViiV Healthcare/GlaxoSmithKline.\n\n\n## METHODS\n\n### Study Population\n\nChildren with HIV less than 12 years of age and weighing 6 to <40 kg were eligible. Participants were recruited from study sites in Botswana, South Africa, Thailand, and the U.S. Eligible participants were treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced and virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <200 copies per mL) on a stable non-NNRTI containing regimen for at least six months prior to entry. At screening, participants were required to be HLA-B*5701-negative, have grade 2 or less severe hematology and chemistry laboratory values, and have no evidence of hepatitis B coinfection. Exclusion criteria included documented resistance to abacavir, dolutegravir, or lamivudine (except M184V); known hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir; current evidence of pancreatitis, active tuberculosis, or AIDS-defining opportunistic infections; or any other medical condition that might interfere with participation or interpretation of study outcomes.\n\n### Ethics Statement\n\nThe study protocol (appendix and https://www.impaactnetwork.org/studies/impaact2019) was reviewed and approved by the Division of AIDS, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, U.S. National Institutes of Health, and site Institutional Review Boards. Written informed consent was obtained from the participant’s parent or legal guardian. Assent was also obtained where applicable in accordance with local requirements.\n\n### Study Design\n\nIMPAACT 2019 (NCT03760458) was an international phase I/II, multi-site, open-label, non-comparative dose confirmation study. Participants were enrolled in five WBs concurrently (Table 1). The study was designed with a dose confirmation phase over the first four weeks among a subset of participants followed by longer term evaluation of safety, tolerability, and efficacy in all participants through 48 weeks. Dose confirmation was based on the first 5–7 children in each WB who were deemed both pharmacokinetic- and safety-evaluable. Pharmacokinetic-evaluable participants were required to have exclusively received the study drug dose being evaluated for their WB between study entry and the day of intensive pharmacokinetic sampling; an observed dose on the day of intensive pharmacokinetic sampling; blood samples collected across all time points; and concentration data for all three study drug components available from all intensive pharmacokinetic sampling time points. Missing data were reviewed for pharmacokinetic evaluability on a case-by-case basis. Dolutegravir concentrations were analyzed and monitored in real-time for comparison to individual targets and direct feedback to study sites. To be safety-evaluable, participants had to receive only the study drug dose being evaluated for their WB between study entry and week 4 or have experienced a grade 3 or higher adverse event (AE) or permanent study drug discontinuation assessed as related to study drug prior to week 4. For a dose to be confirmed, each WB had to meet protocol-defined pharmacokinetic targets based on historical data (AUC0–24h and C24h for dolutegravir; 12,13 AUC0–24h for abacavir and lamivudine14) (appendix p. 3) and safety guidelines (no fatal or life-threatening AEs related to study drug; no grade 3 or higher AEs or permanent discontinuations related to study drug in two or more participants). For dolutegravir, the AUC0–24h target range was based on the lower and upper bounds of the 90% CIs for geometric mean exposures associated with once- and twice-daily dolutegravir in adults (35.1–134 μg∙h/mL).12,13 The dolutegravir C24h target ranges were based on 60% of once-daily and 140% of twice-daily geometric mean values in adults (0.67–2.97 μg/mL). The minimum individual dolutegravir AUC0–24h (≥25 μg∙h/mL) and C24h (≥0.5 μg/mL) targets were based on the 95% maximum virologic response.12 Abacavir and lamivudine AUC0–24h targets (6.3–50.4 and 6.3–26.5 μg∙h/mL, respectively) were based on the lower and upper bound of the 90% CIs for predicted exposures with once-daily administration in children with HIV.14 Dose confirmation determinations were made by the Clinical Management Committee of the protocol team, with independent review and confirmation obtained from the Study Monitoring Committee.\n\nAfter the initial 5–7 participants undergoing intensive pharmacokinetic evaluations were enrolled in each WB, subsequent participants underwent sparse pharmacokinetic collections at the week 1 visit. Remaining study visits took place at weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 for all participants; and weeks 8, 16, and 20 for participants with a known M184V mutation. Participants who grew into a different WB were permitted to increase their dose after Week 4. Adherence and tolerability were assessed via caregiver questionnaires administered at weeks 4, 12, 24, and 48. Hematologic, hepatic, and renal safety evaluations were performed at weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, 48. CD4 cell counts and percentages were performed at weeks 4, 12, 24, and 48. Lipids (non-fasting) were evaluated at weeks 24 and 48. HIV-1 RNA was monitored at all visits except week 1. Site investigators assessed AE relatedness to study drug and AE severity was graded according to the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (corrected version 2.1, July 2017).15\n\n### Pharmacokinetic Analysis\n\nIntensive pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed at Week 1 (i.e., 5–10 days after entry at steady-state). Dosing was confirmed for at least four days leading up to this visit using video or in-person direct observation. Participants were required to fast for intensive pharmacokinetic evaluations (low fat, light snacks permitted at least 2 hours prior to the observed dose). Participants were instructed to disperse the dispersible tablets in water (3 minutes or less) prior to intake, and to swallow the immediate-release tablet whole. Pharmacokinetic samples were collected at time 0 (pre-dose) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours post-dose. Dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine concentrations were analyzed using validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods by the University of Alabama (appendix p. 4). Steady-state intensive pharmacokinetic parameters for all three components were calculated using noncompartmental methods with linear up-log down trapezoidal rule (Phoenix WinNonlin®, Certara, Inc.).\n\n### Outcomes\n\nPrimary pharmacokinetic outcome measures were the geometric mean area under the concentration time curve over the 24-hour dosing interval (AUC0–24h), maximum concentration (Cmax), and concentration at 24 hours post-dose (C24h) for dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine for each WB. Primary safety outcome measures included all AEs and the proportion of participants with at least one of the following deemed related to study drug: grade 3 or higher, fatal or life-threatening, other serious, or AEs that resulted in permanent discontinuation of study drug through 24 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcome measures included virologic suppression, adherence, tolerability (palatability and acceptability), lipid profiles, CD4+ cell count and percentage, and AEs through 48 and 144 weeks of treatment; population pharmacokinetic modeling through 48 weeks; and antiretroviral resistance mutations at the time of virologic failure. Virologic suppression, adherence, tolerability (palatability and acceptability), lipid profiles, and CD4+ cell count and percentage outcomes through 24 weeks of treatment were included in this submission; all other outcomes and data through 48 and 144 weeks will be reported separately. Virologic suppression was summarized with <50 and <200 copies per mL thresholds and with the U.S. FDA snapshot algorithm. 16 Virologic failure was summarized and defined as two consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA values ≥200 copies per mL. For participants who were ART-naïve at entry, the two consecutive results were from specimens collected at or after week 24.\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\nAnalyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 within two populations: the All-Treated Population, defined as participants who received at least one dose of abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine, and the Primary Safety Population (PSP), defined as participants who received abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine and remained on the enrollment WB dose or an increased dose in accordance with their weight through either Week 24 or early treatment discontinuation due to toxicity. Pharmacokinetic analyses included participants who underwent intensive pharmacokinetic evaluations. Analyses of safety, virologic response, immunologic response, and lipids were conducted in the PSP, and the FDA snapshot algorithm was in the All-Treated Population. Adherence and tolerability were presented for the All-Treated Population. All analyses were performed by enrollment WB dose and used while on treatment strategy (i.e., participants were censored the day after treatment discontinuation).17 Safety, viral suppression, and virologic success rates using the FDA snapshot algorithm were summarized with exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A post hoc sensitivity analysis was performed for the primary safety outcome measure with renal laboratory test results graded based on actual value alone rather than grading from both actual value and change from baseline based on the DAIDS AE Table.15 For viral response analyses of <50 copies per mL, unquantifiable HIV RNA was imputed to lower limit of quantification −1. Consistent with the noncomparative dose confirmation study design, no statistical comparisons were made between WBs.\n\n### Sample Size\n\nThe total sample size of at least 50 children, with at least 25 aged <6 years and at least 25 aged 6 to <12 years, was selected based on the previously agreed upon Paediatric Investigation Plan within the European Union and Pediatric Study Plan within the United States for FDC abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine. Within the overall target of 50 children, a minimum of 25, of which at least five in each of the weight bands shown in Table 1, were required to be dose-evaluable for abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine based on the previously described pharmacokinetic and safety-evaluable definitions. The sample size for intensive pharmacokinetic sampling was based on the power to detect a difference between the study-defined AUC0–24h WB minimum and maximum targets of 35.1 and 134 μg∙h/mL for dolutegravir and the geometric mean AUC0–24h value of 53.6 μg∙h/mL (CV 26.9%) in adults. A sample size of 25 provided >99.9% power to detect a change between the adult geometric mean and the lower or upper AUC0–24h target for dolutegravir using log-transformed AUC0–24h values and a two-sample t-test at a significance level of 0.05. A sample size of five participants within each WB provided 94.6% and >99.9% power to detect a difference between the adult dolutegravir geometric mean and the lower and upper AUC0–24h WB targets, respectively. For dolutegravir C24h, 25 participants provided >99.9% power to detect a difference between the geometric mean (%CV) C24h in adults of 1.11 μg/mL (46.3%) and both WB targets of 0.67 and 2.97 μg/mL. Five participants provided 71.8% and 99.9% power for the lower and upper target, respectively. Though a minimum of 5 participants was targeted, up to 7 were permitted to be enrolled in each WB for purposes of intensive pharmacokinetic assessments. To allow for additional enrollments if confident pharmacokinetic determinations could not be made, or if alternative dosing strategies needed to be assessed within a WB, up to 75 children total were permitted to be enrolled.\n\n### Role of the Funding Source\n\nThe U.S. NIH and ViiV/GSK provided funding for the study and ViiV/GSK provided study drug. The study design and interpretation were performed by the protocol team, which includes representatives of the NIH and ViiV/GSK. Data collection and analysis were performed by the IMPAACT Network. All authors contributed to the writing of the manuscript.\n\n## RESULTS\n\n\n### Study Population\n\nParticipants were enrolled from September 9, 2020 through June 28, 2021. The last Week 24 study visit took place on December 14 2021. Sixty-nine children were screened and 57 were enrolled and initiated study drug, composing the All-Treated population (Figure 1 and Table 2). Most (54 [95%]) were treatment-experienced at entry and switched from a regimen containing lopinavir/ritonavir (38 [67%]), dolutegravir (8 [14%]), or raltegravir (7 [12%]) as the anchor medication (appendix p. 5). The three treatment-naïve participants were in the 6 to <10 kg WB. Two ART-experienced participants (one each weighing 6 to <10 kg and 10 to <14 kg) withdrew within eight days of entry due to study drug palatability issues, and a third weighing ≥25 kg relocated then returned to the study prior to week 24, resulting in a temporary interruption of study drug. The remaining 54 participants continued study treatment through 24 weeks and comprise the PSP.\n\n### Dose Confirmation\nThirty-five participants (seven per WB) underwent intensive pharmacokinetic evaluations. Two participants in the 10 to <14 kg WB underwent repeat intensive pharmacokinetic assessments at ~7 weeks post-entry due to questionable integrity of the original Week 1 samples. All 35 participants were both pharmacokinetic- and safety-evaluable. Concentration-time profiles were comparable across all WBs for all three agents (appendix p. 6). Protocol-specified pharmacokinetic targets were met in all five WBs with the originally selected dosing from Table 1 (Figure 2 and Table 3). Four participants (two weighing 6 to <10 kg, one weighing 10 to <14 kg, one weighing 14 to <20 kg) had individual dolutegravir C24h values below the target of 0.5 ug/mL but met the individual AUC0–24h target and were maintained on their original doses. Two participants in the 20 to <25 kg WB had elevated dolutegravir C24h of 3.24 and 4.90 μg/mL, the latter of whom also had dolutegravir AUC0–24h of 138.8 μg∙h/mL, which was above the individual target range. These two participants were also maintained on their original doses. Post hoc dose confirmation analyses were performed with these two participants excluded given their higher AUC0–24h and C24h results, and WB targets were still met (appendix p. 7). Safety guidelines were met within each WB and thus dosing was confirmed for all five WBs at the originally selected dosing.\n\n### Safety\nA summary of AEs by WB is shown in Table 4 and the appendix (p. 8–12). No drug-related AEs were grade 3 or higher, life-threatening, or resulted in abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine discontinuation. Participants experiencing drug-related AEs included 10 (19%) with grade 2 decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), four (7%) with grade 2 increased serum creatinine (SCr), two (4%) with grade 1 increased alanine aminotransferase, and one (2%) with grade 2 nightmares. Related grade 2 SCr increases were confirmed within 2–4 weeks in 2 participants and had resolved in 50% by Week 24. The participant with nightmares reported onset approximately 4 days after starting therapy and resolved 4 weeks later. Of participants with increases in SCr or decreases eGFR, four (33%) and 15 (50%) experienced changes by week 4, respectively, and seven (58%) and 25 (80%) experienced changes by week 12. When grading SCr based on actual value or change from baseline, eight participants had grade 2 and three had grade 3 elevations. However, when grading based on actual values only, there were no participants with grade 2 or higher elevations. Similarly, twenty-seven participants had grade 2 and four had grade 3 reductions in eGFR based on actual value or change from baseline. When grading based on actual values, eight had grade 2 eGFR reductions, none of which were related to study drug.\n\n### Adherence and Tolerability\nAdherence. Across all WBs, caregivers reported that participants received at least 90% of their study drug within the 30 days prior to their study visit. In the few instances with missed doses reported, the primary reason was the caregiver forgetting to administer the dose. All but one caregiver reported “good,” “very good,” or “excellent” administration across all timepoints.\nTolerability, Palatability and Acceptability. The number of dispersible tablets required to be taken in each WB was deemed acceptable by 80–100% of caregivers at Weeks 4, 12, and 24 (appendix p. 13–27). At least 80% of caregivers reported the dispersible tablets dispersed within 3 minutes. At least 67% of caregivers in each of WB 3–5 reported the participant took study drug “easily by themselves.” In WB1, 75% of caregivers at Week 4 and 100% at Weeks 12 and 24 reported the participant took their study drug “easily with help.” In WB2, 91% of caregivers at Weeks 4 and 12, and 82% at Week 24 reported the participant took study drug “easily by themselves” or “easily with help.” Of those in the ≥25 kg WB, one (9%) reportedly broke the tablet before swallowing at Weeks 4 and 12, with the other 10 (91%) reporting intake as a whole tablet across visits. Most caregivers in each WB (70–100%) reported the child’s facial expression corresponded to “average, good, or very good” when taking abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine between Weeks 4, 12, and 24, which was slightly lower but overall comparable to facial ratings of the participant’s favorite food (90–100%).\nVirologic and Immunologic Response\nIn the PSP, 52 participants (96%; 95% CI, 87%, 100%) were suppressed to <200 copies per mL at Week 4 and 53 (98%; 95% CI, 90%, 100%) at Week 24. All 51 ART-experienced participants, including the four with a known M184V mutation, maintained suppression (<200 copies per mL) through 24 weeks. Two of the three ART-naïve participants achieved virologic suppression (<200 copies per mL) by Week 24. The third did not achieve suppression <200 copies per mL by Week 24 and subsequently met the protocol definition of virologic failure. This participant was 1 year of age and entered the study with a viral load of over 3.5 million copies per mL, CD4 count of 2425 cells per mm3, and was WHO Stage 1. Their viral load steadily decreased while on abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine to 419 copies per mL at Week 24, and they remained on study treatment after Week 24 given their positive treatment response. The caregiver reported 100% adherence and no issues with medication administration throughout this period. Using the FDA snapshot algorithm and a threshold of 200 copies per mL in the All-Treated population, virologic success was achieved in 54 (95%; 95% CI, 85%, 99%) at both Weeks 4 and 24. Using a threshold of 50 copies/mL, virologic success was achieved in 47 (83%; 95% CI, 70%, 91%) at Week 4 and 52 (91%; 95% CI, 81%, 97%) at Week 24. Both CD4 count and percentage remained consistent with age-appropriate norms over time across all WBs (appendix p. 28).\n\nLipid Profiles\nAt Week 24, median (Q1, Q3) total cholesterol was 3·91 (3·55, 4·64) mmol/L, HDL cholesterol was 1·26 (1·09, 1·54) mmol/L, LDL cholesterol was 2·25 (1·81, 2·63) mmol/L, and triglyceride levels were 1·00 (0·69, 1·27) mmol/L across all WBs. There was a general decline in all types of cholesterol from baseline through Week 24 across WBs in the PSP (appendix p. 29–33).\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nDosing of dispersible and immediate-release once daily abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine was confirmed in children weighing 6 to <40 kg in alignment with WHO WB dosing recommendations. All ART-experienced participants maintained viral suppression below 200 copies/mL through 24 weeks of treatment. Two of three ART-naïve participants achieved suppression by Week 24. Immunologic outcomes were also favorable. Both dispersible and immediate-release formulations were safe; and adherence, acceptability, and palatability ratings were overall positive across all WBs through 24 weeks of treatment.\n\nProtocol-defined pharmacokinetic targets were met for all three agents, and the AUC0–24h, Cmax, and C24h were comparable or slightly higher than historical pharmacokinetic data with these medications in children and adults with HIV.12–14,18–20 The dispersible formulations generally have resulted in higher AUC and Cmax results for dolutegravir in comparison to the film coated tablets. However, these exposures are still within the range of once- to twice-daily exposures in adults and children.12–14,18–20 Four participants fell below the individual dolutegravir C24h target but were maintained on their original WB dose as they met the individual AUC0–24h targets, thus dose increases may have increased overall drug exposures relative to other participants. Additionally, all C24h results were above the in vivo 90% effective concentration (EC90) of 0.3 μg/mL and within the range of simulated prediction intervals for dolutegravir dispersible tablet exposures upon which FDA approval was based. Prior exposure-response analyses of dolutegravir in children with AUC0–24h, C24h, and the average concentration over the dosing interval showed none of these parameters were associated with decreased virologic response, suggesting drug exposures were on the plateau portion of the exposure-response curve.12 The only predictor of failure to achieve virologic suppression in this previous analysis was a baseline HIV viral load above 100,000 copies per mL. Consistent with these previous findings, all four participants remained suppressed throughout the study, and the single treatment-naïve participant who did not achieve virologic suppression at Week 24 had a high baseline viral load. For the two participants with elevated dolutegravir C24h, both were maintained on their original doses with no safety concerns identified.\n\nChildren receiving NNRTIs were excluded to minimize pharmacokinetic variability as efavirenz and nevirapine cause metabolic enzyme induction and decrease dolutegravir concentrations;21 however, other studies in children have not identified loss of virologic control after switching from an NNRTI- to a dolutegravir-containing regimen.\n\nAdult switch studies of efavirenz to dolutegravir showed the absolute concentrations of dolutegravir remained above the protein adjusted-90% inhibitory concentration (IC90) (0.064 μg/mL) and stabilized four weeks post-switch, thus no washout is needed.22 Children receiving rifampin at entry were also excluded over similar concerns for induction. No participants developed active tuberculosis during this study, but separate pharmacokinetic studies in infants and children have demonstrated this interaction can be overcome by increasing to twice-daily dolutegravir dosing.23,24 A similar approach could be considered with a combination of the FDC formulations and single-entity dolutegravir.\n\nReported adherence was high across all WBs. Most (89%) caregivers rated palatability of the FDC dispersible tablet formulation as average or better, which is similar to ratings of the FDC immediate release tablet formulation in adults (>88%) and slightly lower than ratings for dolutegravir dispersible tablets in children (99%).18,25 Two participants withdrew from the study due to palatability issues within 8 days of treatment with the FDC dispersible tablet formulation. This may have been due in part to the bitter taste of abacavir and regional differences in taste perception as one was in the U.S. and the other was in Thailand. Though the immediate release tablet formulation is now available to children weighing at least 25 kg,7 challenges with swallowing due to the large tablet size (22×11 mm) have been reported.26 Nearly all participants in our study reported intake of whole intact tablets. However, for those with challenges swallowing this tablet, it can be crushed and mixed with food as an alternative. Use of a greater number of dispersible tablets (instead of the immediate release tablet) in this WB was not possible as dolutegravir is 60% more bioavailable in the dispersible formulation than the immediate release formulation whereas abacavir and lamivudine are bioequivalent, which would result in exceeding adult dolutegravir dosing while providing less than the currently approved doses of abacavir and lamivudine.25 Assessments in those weighing 3 to <6 kg were not performed as the recommended dolutegravir dose is 5 mg once daily. To be consistent with this dosing, only a single dispersible FDC tablet could be administered, which would result in underdosing of the abacavir/lamivudine components at 60/30 mg comparatively to the WHO WB doses of 120/60 mg.\n\nBoth FDC formulations were overall safe and well-tolerated in our study population through 24 weeks of treatment. No grade 3 or higher AEs deemed related to study drug occurred and most lower grade AEs involved renal function changes that were asymptomatic and not of clinical concern. Dolutegravir can cause benign increases in SCr through inhibition of renal transporters,27 thus our findings were not unexpected. One participant reported grade 2 nightmares deemed related to study drug. Dolutegravir has been associated with central nervous system side effects in a small percentage of people, some risk factors for which may include pre-existing psychiatric disorders, higher plasma concentrations and abacavir coadministration.28\n\nSafety, tolerability, and efficacy findings should be interpreted with some caution due to our limited sample size and there is limited precision for event rate estimates within individual WBs. Most enrolled participants were treatment-experienced, on a stable ART regimen, and virologically suppressed at entry. This may have selected for individuals more likely to tolerate ART in various formulations for extended periods. Results may not be generalizable to ART-naïve or ART-experienced children who are not virologically suppressed on a stable ART regimen. However, the demographics of our study population are consistent with the global population of children with HIV, and we would not expect pharmacokinetic differences between naïve and experienced populations. Exposure matching to adult populations is the basis upon which regulatory approvals for ART in children with HIV have been historically based. Prior pharmacokinetic, safety, and efficacy data with the individual agents,12,14,18,29 bioequivalence/relative bioavailability studies in adults,25 and modeling and simulation data resulted in U.S. FDA approval of FDC abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine dispersible and immediate release tablets for children weighing 10 to less than 40 kg in March 2022.10 The EMA also approved these formulations in children weighing more than 14 kg in February 2023 based in part on our pharmacokinetic data. 11 Full treatment histories were not collected prior to entry; thus, there is a possibility of undocumented resistance prior to switching. All treatment-experienced participants maintained suppression for 24 weeks in our study, but review of full treatment histories should still be considered when switching to this FDC. We also screened for hepatitis B coinfection in addition to HLA-B*5701 for entry into the study. If laboratory screenings are required prior to use, this may be a barrier to larger scale rollout. However, this is not typically done in resource-limited settings, and the WHO does not currently recommend these screenings prior to using this combination. 6 Furthermore, studies in children with HIV have shown abacavir is safe and well-tolerated even in the absence of HLA-B*5701 testing. 30 Finally, we have only presented results through 24 weeks of treatment; additional data from longer follow-up and larger studies are important for understanding the benefits and risks of these FDC options alongside other available ART regimens.\n\nOur favorable pharmacokinetic, safety, tolerability, and efficacy results support the use of these FDCs in children and align with other recent studies that have shown superior outcomes with dolutegravir-containing regimens. These collective findings represent a significant advancement in pediatric HIV care as the same once-daily FDC formulation can be used in children weighing 6 to less than 25 kg without the need to change between multiple medications and formulations as the child grows. These results are expected to inform regulatory decisions for use of the dispersible tablet in children 6 to less than 10 kg in the U.S. and children weighing at least 6 kg globally, providing a critical step towards ensuring the global availability of dolutegravir-containing, child-friendly FDC options in children with HIV.\n\n\n## DATA SHARING STATEMENT\nThe data cannot be made publicly available due to the ethical restrictions in the study’s informed consent documents and in the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Network’s approved human subjects protection plan; public availability may compromise participant confidentiality. However, data are available to all interested researchers upon request to the IMPAACT Statistical and Data Management Center’s data access committee (email address: gro.frtsf@atad.cads) with the agreement of the IMPAACT Network.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 37815035\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Methods\nParticipants were adolescents aged 12 to <18 years who weighed at least 45 kg and who were either antiretroviral (ARV)-naïve or virologically suppressed without documented resistance mutations to DOR/3TC/TDF.

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three oral regimens: dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate; dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; or efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Up to 14 days of the antepartum ART before enrolment was permitted. Women with known multiple gestation, fetal anomalies, acute significant illness, creatinine more than 2·5 times the upper limit of normal, or estimated creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL/min were excluded. Primary safety analyses were pairwise comparisons between ART regimens of the proportion of maternal and infant adverse events of grade 3 or higher up to 50 weeks post partum. Secondary efficacy analyses at 50 weeks post partum included comparison of the proportion of women with plasma HIV-1 RNA of less than 200 copies per mL in the combined dolutegravir-containing groups versus the efavirenz-containing group. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned participants with available data.

The presence of drug resistance\nmutations (DRMs) in LLV was a strong predictor of subsequent VF. The\ndata on drug resistance (DR) or DRMs for HIV-1 infections at low-level\nviral load (LLVL) are limited in China.\n\n### Objective\n\nTo monitor the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance and to evaluate the\nrisk factors associated with drug resistance in LLVL HIV-1 infections\nduring ART in Guangdong, China.\n\n### Methods\n\nPlasma samples with LLVL during ART in Guangdong Province between Jan\n2011 and Dec 2022 were subjected to a modified reverse-transcription PCR\nwith a pre-step of virus concentration by ultracentrifugation before\nextraction and the Sanger sequencing. Then, the genotypic resistance\ntest was performed and DR was analyzed by the Stanford HIVDB program.\nFinally, DR-associated factors were identified by logistic regression\nanalysis.\n\n### Results\n\nWe found that CRF01_AE (53.57%) and CRF07_BC (25.07%) were the dominant\nHIV-1 genotypes in LLVL in Guangdong between 2011 and 2022 but that the\npercentage of CRF01_AE showed a trend of decrease over time. M46\n(1.49%), M184 (30.91%), and K103 (21.46%) were the dominant PI-, NRTI-,\nand NNRTI-associated mutations, respectively. The total DR rate was\n47.06%. Specifically, PI (3.71%) showed a significantly lower DR rate\nthan NNRTI (40.74%) and NRTI (34.14%). Duration of ART, initial ART\nregimen, ethnicity, and WHO clinical stages were associated with DR.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe drug resistance rate among the LLVL during ART in Guangdong, China\nis high. The risk factors associated with HIV drug resistance should be\nseriously considered for better control.\n\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### Study Population and Sampling Strategy\n\nHIV-1 infected individuals were eligible for inclusion in this study if\nthey have received ART for at least 6 months with HIV-1 viral load\nbetween 200 to 1000 copies/mL. A total of 3274 samples were collected\nfrom patients living in Guangdong China between Nov 1st, 2011 to Dec\n31st, 2022. Five milliliters of blood with EDTA were collected during\nfollow-up and the plasma was obtained by centrifuging the sample at 3000\nr/m for 5 min. Epidemiological data for the patients (including sex,\nage, delay of ART initiation, duration of ART, initial treatment\nregimen, HIV transmission route, degree of education, marital status,\nethnicity, WHO clinical stages, geographical region, and occupation)\nwere downloaded from the National Free Antiretroviral Treatment Database\nfor Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n### Concentration, Partial Pol Gene Amplification, and Assembly\n\nAccording to the method described in the previous study, ^18^ we have\nmade some adjustments. Zero point five-milliliter plasma was\nconcentrated by ultracentrifugation at 4°C, 20,000× g for 1 hour. Then,\n0.36 mL of the supernatant was removed, and the remaining 0.14 mL was\nleft for nucleic acid extraction. RNA was extracted from the\nconcentrated sample using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen,\nGerman). The partial HIV-1 *pol* gene (HXB2 nt 2253--3252) was amplified\nby one-step RT-PCR and nested PCR as previously described. ^21^ The\npositive PCR products were purified and sequenced in a commercial\ncompany (Tianyi Huiyuan, China). The sequences obtained were assembled\nand cleaned using Sequencher version 5.4 software (Gene Codes\nCorporation), and those less than 980 bp were excluded from the\nanalysis. Finally, partial *pol* sequences were obtained from 2074 out\nof 3274 samples (63.35%) in this analysis.\n\n### Genotype Determination\n\nTo determine the HIV-1 genotypes, all sequences were adjusted manually\nand submitted to the online subtyping tool Context-based Modeling for\nExpeditious Typing (COMET HIV-1, https://comet.lih.lu/index.php ) by\nbatch, developed by the Luxembourg Institute of Health ^22^ and the\nunassigned sequences were verified by the HIV-1 Subtyping Tool REGA\nVersion 3.0 (\nhttp://dbpartners.stanford.edu:8080/RegaSubtyping/stanford-hiv/typingtool/\n), developed by Tulio de Oliveira. ^23^ The maximum likelihood (ML)\nphylogenetic tree was used for confirmation. Sequences were aligned and\nmerged with HIV-1 subtyping references downloaded from the Los Alamos\nHIV Sequence Database via Bioedit software. The phylogenetic tree was\nconstructed using the ML method with the general time-reversible (GTR)\nsubstitution model with the PhyML 3.0 ^24^ and the branch support value\nwas estimated using the approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT). The\nfinal trees were visualized using the Figtree 1.4.2. The SH-like support\naLTR value of 0.9 was selected as the threshold for identifying\ndifferent viral lineages in the ML phylogeny.\n\n### Drug Resistance Mutation and Drug Resistance\n\nThe Stanford HIV dbprogram 9.4 (last updated on 7th Dec. 2022,\nhttps://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-sequences/ ) was used to identify\nDRMs and infer resistance to antiretroviral drugs, including protease\ninhibitors (PI), nucleoside reverse- transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and\nnon-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). ^25^ Sequences\nwere determined to be susceptible (\\<15, including potential resistance)\nor resistant (15\\<=low-level resistance\\<30, 30\\<= intermediate-level\nresistance\\<60, or high-level resistance≥60) according to their mutation\nscores.\n\n### Nucleotide Sequence Data\n\nThe partial *pol* nucleotide sequences were submitted to GenBank under\nthe accession numbers: OQ886077 - OQ888150 .\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS program version\n25.0. Qualitative statistics were described using frequency.\nQuantitative statistics were described using the median (range).\nCategorical variables were compared using the chi-square test.\nUnivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed\nto identify potential risk factors. A P-value \\< 0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant. Variables with a P-value \\< 0.05 in the\nunivariate logistic regression analysis were included in the\nmultivariate logistic regression analysis. Crude odds ratios (cORs) and\nadjusted odds ratios (aORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (95%\nCIs) were reported.\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Demographic and Clinical Characteristics\n\nA total of 3274 patients were enrolled and 2074 HIV-1 partial *pol*\nsequences were obtained and subsequently used to establish the dataset.\nThe participants were between 5 and 89 years old, with a median age of\n43 years. 75.22% (1560/2074) of the subjects were male. The median\n(range) of the HIV-1 viral load (Copies/mL, Log10) was 2.70\n(2.30--3.00). The time between HIV-1 confirmation and initial ART ranged\n0.00 to 16.81 years, with a median of 0.16. And the years of duration of\nART were 0.50 to 16.65, with a median of 3.03. Among the 1412 samples\n(68.08%, 1412/2074) have baseline CD4+ T cell count data, the median\n(range) of the baseline CD4+ T cell count was 177 (1--1256) cells/mm3,\nand 56.44% (797/1412) of the participants exhibited a CD4+ T cell count\nof \\<200 cells/mm ^3^ . Other patient characteristics are shown in Table\n1 .\n\n### Distribution of HIV-1 Genotypes\n\nThe online subtyping tool COMET HIV-1 was used to classify genotypes by\nbatch, and the classification was rechecked using REGA version 3.0 and\nthe ML phylogenetic tree. More than ten different HIV-1 genotypes were\nobserved among the 2074 participants.\n\nThe main HIV-1 genotypes circulating were found to be CRF01_AE (53.57%,\n1111/2074), CRF07_BC (25.07%, 520/2074), CRF08_BC (6.27%, 130/2074) and\nCRF55_01B (4.92%, 102/2074), accounting for 89.92% of total infections.\nHIV-1 CRF59_01B (0.99%, 14/2074), Subtype C (0.78%, 11/2074), CRF02_AG\n(0.21%, 3/2074), CRF85_BC (0.14%, 2/2074), subtype G (0.07%, 1/2074),\nCRF67_01B (0.07%, 1/2074) and CRF68_01B (0.07%, 1/2074) were less\nfrequently observed. In addition, 109 possible novel recombinant strains\nwere observed (REGA tool \"Recombination\", \"Recombinationlike\",\n\"potential-Recombination\", or \"check the report\"; and COMET tool\n\"unassigned\"). Less frequent HIV-1 genotypes and recombinant strains\nwere classified as \"other\" genotypes ( Figure 1A and ​ andB B ).\n\nFigure 1\n\nDistribution characteristics of HIV-1 genotypes in low-level viral load\nHIV-1 infections in Guangdong, different colors present different\ngenotypes, as shown in the legend.

( **C** ) Proportion of various\ngenotypes of HIV-1 circulating throughout the study period, from 2011 to\n2022.\n\nThe distribution of HIV-1 genotypes in different years is generally\nconsistent, with the genotypes changes observed over time: CRF01_AE\ninfections decreased from 68.66% before 2014 to 43.90% in 2021--2022 (χ\n^2^ =44.838, p\\<0.001), while those of CRF07_BC, CRF55_01B, and other\ngenotypes continued to increase (18.66% to 27.00%, χ ^2^ =6.910,\np=0.009; 2.24% to 8.19%, χ ^2^ =10.963, p\\<0.001; 2.61% to 8.71%, χ ^2^\n=10.767, p=0.001) ( Figure 1C ).\n\n### Characteristics of Drug Resistance Mutations\n\nAmong the 2074 participants, 59.21% (1228/2074) exhibited DRMs, with\n5.01% (104/2074), 39.68% (823/2074), and 49.13% (1019/2074) exhibiting\nresistance-associated mutation patterns for PI, NRTI, and NNRTI,\nrespectively ( Figure 2A ). The DRM rate of PI was lower than that of\nNRTI and NNRTI (χ ^2^ =718.168 or 1022.294 respectively, p \\<0.001). The\nDRM rate of NNRTI was higher than that of NRTI, and the difference is\nstatistically significant (χ ^2^ =37.515, p\\<0.001).\n\nFigure 2\n\nDistribution and percentage of DRMs in low-level viral load HIV-1\ninfections in Guangdong, China.

The\nmost prevalent PI-associated mutation was M46I/L (1.49%, 31/2074),\nfollowed by V82A/F (0.82%, 17/2074) ( Figure 2B ). M184I/L/T/V(30.91%,\n641/2074) was the most common NRTI-associated mutation, followed by\nS68G/N/R (12.87%, 267/2074) and K65N/R (9.16%, 190/2074) ( Figure 2C ).\nK103A/N/Q/S/T (21.46%, 445/2074) was the dominant NNRTI-associated\nmutation, followed by V179D/E/F/T (14.26%, 190/2074) and V106 A/I/M\n(9.53%, 195/2074) ( Figure 2D ). The frequency and percentage of other\nDRMs are shown in Figure 2B--D .\n\n### Profiles of Drug Resistance\n\nThe HIV-1 resistance levels and percentage of 20 ARV drugs were\nanalyzed, as shown in Figure 3 . 976 out of 2074 patients (47.06%) were\nresistant to at least one drug ( Figure 3A and Table 2 ). The total DR\nrate was 47.06% (976/2074), with PI (3.71%, 77/2074) showing a lower DR\nrate than NNRTI (40.74%, 845/2074) (χ ^2^ =822.557, p\\<0.001) and NRTI\n(34.14%, 708/2074) (χ ^2^ =625.606, p\\<0.001) ( Figure 3A ). HIV\npatients with a VL of 200--499 copies/mL had a lower DR rate than those\nwith a VL of 500--999 copies/mL (χ ^2^ =11.527, p\\<0.001) ( Figure 3A ).\nThe prevalence of DR varied throughout the study period, there was no\nclear trend observed from 47.74% in 2015--2016 to 43.03% in 2021--2022\n(χ ^2^ =3.774, p=0.287) ( Figure 3A ).\n\nFor NRTI, the resistance to seven NRTI ranged from 6.12% (127/2074) to\n33.27% (690/2074). DR to AZT (6.12%) was significantly lower than that\nto ABC (33.27%) (χ ^2^ =457.008, p\\<0.001), FTC (32.88%) (χ ^2^\n=447.724, p\\<0.001), 3TC (32.88%) (χ ^2^ =447.724, p\\<0.001), TDF\n(14.75%) (χ ^2^ =80.438, p\\<0.001), D4T (17.60%) (χ ^2^ =126.652,\np\\<0.001) and DDI (20.06%) (χ ^2^ =170.982, p\\<0.001) ( Figure 3B ). For\nNNRTI, the resistance to five NNRTI ranged from 19.19% (398/2074) to\n40.07% (831/2074), and the DR prevalence to NVP and EFV was 40.07%\n(831/2074) and 39.68% (823/2074), respectively. ETR (19.19%) showed the\nlowest DR frequency, followed by RPV (24.73%), DOR (24.78%), EFV\n(39.68%), and NVP (40.07%) (χ ^2^ =331.422, p\\<0.001). The frequencies\nof DR to DOR (24.78%) and RPV (24.73%), or EFV (39.68%) and NVP (40.07%)\nwere similar (χ ^2^ =0.001 or 0.056 respectively, p\\<0.001) ( Figure 3B\n). For PI, the prevalence of DR to eight PI ranged from 0.87% (18/2074)\nto 3.23% (67/2074) (χ ^2^ =331.422, p\\<0.001), with only the DR to NFV/r\n(3.23%) being more than 3.00% and that to DRV/r (0.87%) being only below\n1.00% ( Figure 3B ).Among the 976 patients resistant to at least one\ndrug, a total of 606 (62.08%) individuals showed low or above-level drug\nresistance to more than one class of drugs: 38 (3.89%) individuals\nexpressed triple resistance, 568 (58.19%) individuals expressed dual\nresistance, whereas 370 (37.91%) ones expressed single resistance to one\nclass drug ( Table 2 ).\n\n### Influencing Factors of Drug Resistance\n\nFactors associated with HIV DR (sex, age, delay of ART initiation,\nduration of ART, initial treatment regimen, HIV transmission route,\ndegree of education, marital status, ethnicity, WHO clinical stages,\ngeographical region, occupation, and genotype) were listed in Table 1 .\nIn the univariate logistic regression analysis, nine factors were\nsignificantly associated with HIV DR. Variables with a *P* -value \\<\n0.05 in the univariate logistic regression analysis were included in the\nmultivariate logistic regression analysis. Patients whose duration of\nART was 1\\~5 years or greater than 5 years were more likely to be\nresistant to drugs than those whose duration of ART was less than 1 year\n(1\\~5 years versus \\<1 year: OR=1.806, 95% CI=1.376--2.370, P\\<0.001;\n\\>5 years versus \\<1 year: OR=2.374, 95% CI=1.755--3.211, P\\<0.001).\nPatients whose initial treatment regimen was 2NRTI+PI were less likely\nto be resistant to drugs than those whose initial treatment regimen was\n2NRTI+NNRTI (2NRTI+PI versus 2NRTI+NNRTI: OR=0.584, 95% CI=0.432--0.790,\nP\\<0.001). The sequences derived from patients whose WHO clinical stages\nwere IV were more likely to be resistant to drugs than those derived\nfrom patients whose WHO clinical stages were I (stage IV versus stage 1:\nOR=1.467, 95% CI=1.091--1.971, P=0.011).\n\n## Discussion\n\nWhen HIV/AIDS patients undergo VF, routine DR tests should be carried\nout, and the therapeutic regimen should be adjusted according to the DR\nresults. However, the number of viruses contained in the LLVL plasma was\nlow, and routine DR test is often unsuccessful. Previous studies\nillustrated that the appearance of LLV may be related to DR. ^18^ ^,^\n^26^ ^,^ ^27^ In this study, we used ultracentrifugation to concentrate\nHIV RNA from patients whose VL was between 200 and 1000 copies/mL after\nat least 6 months of ART treatment, and the overall amplification\nsuccess rate was 63.35%, consistent with the results of previous\nstudies. ^27^ ^,^ ^28^\n\nThe dominant epidemic HIV-1 genotypes detected in LLVL in Guangdong\nbetween 2011 and 2022 were CRF01_AE (53.57%) and CRF07_BC (25.07%). This\nresult is consistent with a previous study among the LLVL with VL\nbetween 50 and 1000 copies/µL in Beijing 2020--2022 (44.8% CRF01_AE and\n25.4% CRF07_BC). ^19^ And we found a significant decrease of CRF01_AE\nfrom 68.66% before 2014 to 43.90% in 2021--2022 (p\\<0.001) and a\nsignificant increase of CRF07_BC from 18.66% before 2014 to 27.00% in\n2021--2022 (p\\<0.009). These tendencies were consistent with that of\nCRF01_AE (from 49.68% in 2006 to 43.2% in 2013 and 35.56% in 2018) and\nthat of CRF07_BC (from 22.26% in 2006 to 26.3% in 2013 and 35.90% in\n2018) among treatment-naive patients in Guangdong. ^29--31^\n\nThe most common NRTI-associated mutation was M184 in this study,\nobserved in 30.91% (641/2074) participants, and the most common\nNNRTI-associated mutation was K103, observed in 21.46% (445/2074)\nparticipants ( Figure 2 ). A high frequency of K103 plus M184 (11.9%,\n248/2074) was observed in this study, and K103 plus M184 appeared\nsufficient to abrogate the NRTI and NNRTI activity of a regimen\ncomprising FTC, 3TC, EFV, or NVP. ^32^ ^,^ ^33^ Furthermore, K103 and\nM184 were the most commonly transmitted DRM. ^34--36^ As a consequence,\nmore attention should be reinforced to the possibility of transmitted\nDR. The other NNRTI mutations identified in our study were V179, V106,\nG190, and Y181. All mutations, except V179, reduced sensitivity to NVP\nand EFV, which were in accordance with the two NNRTI drugs selected in\nour first-line regimen. V179 was recommended by the Stanford HIV Drug\nResistance Database as likely to reduce the virological response to NVP\nand EFV susceptibility. ^37^ Previous studies confirmed that compared\nwith patients not carried drug-resistant strains, those with drug\nresistance mutations have a higher risk of developing VF in the future,\nand early drug-resistance testing and adjusting treatment plans based on\ndrug-resistance results can reduce the risk of developing VF and reduce\nthe accumulation of additional drug resistance mutations. ^38--40^\n\nHere we found that the overall DR rate in LLVL in Guangdong was 47.06%,\nespecially in NRTI and NNRTI with lower resistance barriers such as\nFTC/3TC/ABC or EFV/NVP, which is lower than our previous results in MSM\n(64.12%, 252/393) ^41^ or sexual transmission (64.74%, 123/190) ^42^\nwith HIV-1 VL\\>1000 after ART (χ2=38.479 or 21.776, p\\<0.001). The\noverall DR rate in LLVL in Guangdong is similar to that in LLV in other\nprovinces of China such as Beijing (36.59%, 15/41, or 38.81%, 26/67)\n^19^ ^,^ ^28^ and Jiangsu (40.50%, 98/242), ^20^ but is significantly\nlower than that in LLV in Rome, Italy (67.96%, 925/1361) ^7^ (χ ^2^\n=1.771, 1.775, 3.753 or 145.32, p= 0.183, 0.183, 0.053 or \\<0.001). The\ndifference between ART-experienced patients with VL 200--999 and those\nwith VL \\>1000 in Guangdong may be due to the ART-experienced patients\nwith lower VL have lower medication compliance, while the difference\nbetween ART-experienced patients with VL 200--1000 in China and other\ncountries may due to the different genotype distribution or treatment\nregimen, the specific reasons still need to be explored in a future\nstudy. And we also found the PI DR rate was lower than NNRTI and NRTI\nand the difference is statistically significant (χ ^2^ =822.557 or\n625.606, p\\<0.001). The result of multivariate logistic regression\nanalysis also showed that patients whose initial treatment regimen was\n2NRTI+PI were less likely to be resistant to drugs than those whose\ninitial treatment regimen was 2NRTI+NNRTI ( Table 1 ). Furthermore, the\nDR rate of PI plus NRTI dual drug classes in the 976 drug resistance LLV\npopulation in Guangdong Province is relatively low (13/976, 1.33%) (\nTable 2 ). All these results suggested that the patients with low-level\nviral load could be prescribed treatment regimen containing PIs after\ndrug adherence enhancement in Guangdong.\n\nThe parameters examined in this study had no significant effect on drug\nresistance except Duration of HAART, Initial treatment regimen,\nEthnicity, and WHO Clinical stages (P\\<0.001, \\<0.001, 0.001, and 0.011,\nrespectively). Virus load rebound or virologic failure without\nresistance is most often the result of inadequate drug concentrations\ncaused by drug-drug interactions or poor adherence. ^5^ In this study,\npatients with a treatment duration below one year (33.33%) or using\n2NRTI+PI initial treatment (34.84%) had a lower drug resistance rate\nthan other groups. The patients with the WHO clinical stage IV had a\nhigher drug resistance rate than other groups in terms of the\ncorresponding factors. More attention should be paid to differentiate\nbetween adherence- and resistance-driven LLVL, which are not mutually\nexclusive. In line with the evidence that different frequencies of DRMs\nand DR among HIV-1 subtypes circulate among drug-naive and treated\nindividuals in China, ^43^ ^,^ ^44^ there were different DR rates among\ndifferent genotypes in this study with the difference no statistically\nsignificant ( Table 1 ).\n\nOur study had several limitations. First, of the 3274 LLVL during ART in\nGuangdong China, only 2074 (63.35%) were included in the final study\nsuccessfully. The HIV DR rate in this study may not better represent the\ntrue drug resistance rate. Second, due to testing techniques and sample\nsize limitations, ART-experienced patients with a VL of 50--200\ncopies/mL were not included. Next, we will increase the volume of\ncentrifugal concentration to 1mL in an attempt to detect cases with a\nviral load of 50--200 copies/mL.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, our study provided an overview of the DR profile among\nART-experienced LLVL in Guangdong, China, 2011--2022. There was a high\npercentage of DRM to NRTI and NNRTI, meanwhile, there were multiple DRMs\nin NRTIs and NNRTIs. The total DR rate of these ART-experienced LLVLs\nwas close to 50%. Long-term and ongoing surveillance of HIV DR among\nthese patients is necessary, which will help us to adjust the treatment\nregimen as soon as possible and better grasp the prevalence of\nresistance.\n\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nOur study was supported by the Guangzhou Science and Technology Plan\nProject (202201011646, 202201020503) The funders had no role in study\ndesign, data collection, analysis, the decision to publish, and\npreparation of the article.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 36146776\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: Monitoring HIV-1 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs) is important for disease surveillance. Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

The mean age of the participants was calculated to be 32.21 yr and over half of the patients (n=16) were male and the mean time of HARRT use was 47.69 months.  Standard first-line regimen in Iran is comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI);  drug resistance mutations for the 3 classes of ART (NNRTI, NRTI, and PI) were observed and 4 samples showed resistance to all of them.\nRationale: The paper mentions the patients got standard treatment, and the evidence indicates the presence of mutations associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, suggesting that individuals in the study had received these drug classes prior to sample sequencing.\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI\n\nPMID: 36016383\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be transmitted via parenteral, sexual, or vertical exposure routes. The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals.

Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon.\nRationale: The paper doest not mention in vitro drug susceptibility data or phenotypic data.

We determined the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity in Bulgaria during 2012--2020 using polymerase sequences from 1053 of 2010 (52.4%) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. Sequences were analyzed for DRM using the WHO HIV SDRM list implemented in the calculated population resistance tool at Stanford University. Genetic diversity was inferred using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetics. Cluster detection and characterization was performed using MicrobeTrace. The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%). Most (34/60, 56.7%) of the SDRMs were present in transmission clusters of different subtypes composed mostly of male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC), including a 14-member cluster of subtype B sequences from 12 MMSC and two males reporting heterosexual contact; 13 had the L90M PI mutation and one had the T215S NRTI SDRM. We found a low SDRM prevalence amid high HIV-1 diversity among ART-naive patients in Bulgaria during 2012--2020. The majority of SDRMs were found in transmission clusters containing MMSC, indicative of onward spread of SDRM in drug-naive individuals. Our study provides valuable information on the transmission dynamics of HIV drug resistance in the context of high genetic diversity in Bulgaria, for the development of enhanced prevention strategies to end the epidemic.\n\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity using sequences from ART-naive individuals.

We present a case of\nsuccessful achievement of undetectable HIV RNA viral load levels in an\nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patient with long-standing\nvirologic failure within two months of CAB/RPV LA initiation. This was\nlater complicated by immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)\ndue to *Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare* (MAI) infection and\nhepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation.\n\n## CASE DESCRIPTION\n\nA 47-year-old male infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type\n1 with long-standing AIDS, cured hepatitis C virus, resolved HBV\ninfection, remote neurosyphilis, cocaine abuse, migraine, chronic back\npain with chronic narcotic use and chronic skin excoriations presented\nto the Infectious Diseases clinic for a follow-up visit. He had no known\nprior history of opportunistic infections.\n\nThe patient had been prescribed etravirine 200 mg, dolutegravir 50 mg,\ndarunavir 600 mg and ritonavir 100 mg, all dosed twice daily by mouth\nwith numerous resistance tests performed over the last several years\nshowing no resistance to the current regimen. He did harbour HIV drug\nresistance mutations on old resistance testing to tenofovir, lamivudine,\nemtricitabine, abacavir and efavirenz. The patient was also prescribed\n*Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis with daily\ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 800--160 mg and MAI infection prophylaxis\nwith azithromycin 1200 mg every week.\n\nOn examination, the patient was mildly tachycardic, with a heart rate of\n102 beats per minute. Otherwise, he had normal vital signs. Other\nrelevant findings included a cachectic build with skin excoriations on\nthe arms and legs. Despite stated compliance with his medications, his\nhelper T cell count (CD4) was less than 10 cells/mm ^3^ (normal\n443--1471 cells/mm ^3^ ), and his HIV viral load was more than 300,000\ncopies/ml. His CD4 count had been below 50 cells/mm ^3^ for almost three\nyears. Serum darunavir levels were obtained on several occasions in the\npast, which were not detectable or barely detectable on one occasion,\nindicating little to no medication was present in the patient's system\nraising compliance concerns. Despite this, the patient mentioned that he\nwas taking all his medications.\n\nHe became increasingly despondent and enrolled in a hospice due to his\nchronic pain and AIDS diagnosis. Given his decline and eventual\nprogression to death without proper treatment, a decision was made to\ninitiate a therapeutic trial of long-acting injectable\ncabotegravir/rilpivirine (CAB/RPV) in an attempt to induce virological\nsuppression, despite a detectable viral load. He had no known resistance\nto either drug or had never taken either in the past. The patient\nreceived loading doses of CAB 600 mg and RPV 900 mg intramuscularly with\nno immediate adverse reactions. He was instructed to follow up monthly\nfor maintenance dose administration of CAB 400 mg and RPV 600 mg, which\nhe complied with. On follow-up, his HIV viral load became undetectable\n(less than 40 copies/ml), down from more than 300,000 copies/ml in less\nthan two months. His CD4 count remained low at 21 cells/mm ^3^ . The\npatient had not had an undetectable viral load since his initial HIV\ndiagnosis in 1996 and his liver transaminases were noted to be mildly\nelevated. The patient has a history of resolved hepatitis B (hepatitis B\nsurface antigen \\[HBsAg\\] negative, hepatitis B surface antibody\n\\[anti-HBs or HBsAb\\] negative, hepatitis B core antibody \\[anti-HBc\\]\npositive, hepatitis B e-antigen \\[HBeAg\\] negative, hepatitis B\ne-antibody \\[HBeAb\\] positive, and HBV deoxyribonucleic acid \\[DNA\\]\nnegative). Due to his history, repeat HBV DNA, HBsAg and HBeAg testing\nwere performed and were all positive indicating HBV reactivation. The\npatient was started on emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg\nonce daily by mouth. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis\nwas obtained due to fever, abdominal pain and distention, which revealed\nhepatosplenomegaly with multiple enlarged retroperitoneal and mesenteric\nlymph nodes seen with the largest measuring up to 3.6 × 2.0 cm ( Fig. 1\n). Acid-fast bacillus (AFB) blood cultures were ordered due to concerns\nabout MAI. The AFB resulted positive for MAI, with susceptibility tests\nshowing resistance to clarithromycin and sensitivity to amikacin *(*\nTable 1 ).\n\nFigure 1\n\nCT of abdomen and pelvis showing multiple enlarged retroperitoneal and\nmesenteric lymph nodes, seen with the largest measuring up to 3.6 × 2.0\ncm\n\nThe patient refused to go to the hospital because he was enrolled in a\nhospice and requested outpatient treatment. He was started on once-daily\nintravenous amikacin via a peripherally inserted central catheter line,\nin addition to rifabutin, ethambutol and moxifloxacin by mouth. The\npatient had an excellent clinical response, with a reduction in his\nabdominal distension and pain. After eight weeks, amikacin was\ndiscontinued. The patient was compliant, per his report, with rifabutin,\nethambutol and moxifloxacin. He still reported some fever and sweats.\nFollow-up AFB blood cultures two months into treatment initiation were\nstill positive for MAI, raising concern again regarding compliance. His\nliver function tests normalised. However, due to increasing values of\nHBV DNA (750 million IU/ml) despite reported compliance with treatment,\nhepatitis B virus drug resistance testing was ordered, which showed no\nresistance to lamivudine/emtricitabine. Tenofovir susceptibility could\nnot be reported. He is currently four months into his MAI and HBV\ntherapy with ongoing fevers, weight loss and abdominal distension. He\ncontinues with monthly CAB/RPV LA injections. His CD4 count is 23\ncells/mm ^3^ , and he remains in the hospice.\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nManagement simplification has been the goal of recent HIV drug research\nto improve patient adherence, decrease the adverse effects of\nmedications and improve the overall quality of life ^\\[\\ 1\\ \\]^ . The\ncombination regimen of two long-acting injectable drugs cabotegravir and\nrilpivirine, an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) and a\nnon-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) respectively,\nhave been studied in two clinical trials -- ATLAS and FLAIR\n^\\[\\ 1\\ ,\\ 2\\ \\]^ . The findings of these two trials built the\nfoundation for the ATLAS-2M non-inferiority study comparing the\nonce-monthly CAB/RPV regimen to the every-two-month regimen ^\\[\\ 3\\ \\]^\n.\n\nThe approved indication for CAB/RPV LA is an ART switch in a\nvirologically suppressed patient to maintain this suppression. Because\nof this patient's likely progression to death in the short term without\neffective ART, he was initiated on CAB/RPV LA despite his viral load\nbeing 300,000 copies/ml. We chose a once-a-month regimen to ensure close\nfollow-up given his history of non-compliance and to test quickly for\nany emerging resistance should he fail to suppress. In this patient, the\ninitiation of this regimen led to rapid virological suppression within\ntwo months, which has been maintained now for six months. Luckily, he\nappears not to have been harbouring any significant archived INSTI or\nNNRTI resistance which could have led to CAB/RPV failure. The data on\nCAB/RPV LA use in non-virologically suppressed patients is slim. Ward\n86, an HIV clinic based at San Francisco General Hospital/University of\nCalifornia, is studying and offering long-acting injectable ART for HIV\ntreatment to patients who have challenges with oral medication adherence\nand are not virologically suppressed. In a first demonstration study of\n15 patients who initiated CAB/RPV injections between June 2021 and April\n2022 with detectable viremia, twelve patients (80%--95%, confidence\ninterval 55%--93%) achieved viral suppression. The other three had a\ntwo-log viral load decline by a median of 22 days ^\\[\\ 6\\ \\]^ . Notably,\nour patient had never achieved viral suppression prior to initiating the\nCAB/RPV LA, and he achieved it very rapidly. Achieving viral suppression\nin those who have never been suppressed spotlights the important role\nthese medications could play in those with challenges adhering to oral\nART, provided they are not resistant to the given agents. One study\nshowed that 40% of patients with HIV-1 across the United States are less\nthan 80% adherent to their medication regimen ^\\[\\ 4\\ \\]^ ; it is\nimportant to consider long-acting medications as a solution. Another\nmeta-analysis showed individual barriers to ART adherence vary,\nincluding forgetting to take the medications, being away from home,\ndaily routine change, depression, alcohol/substance use, feeling sick,\nsecrecy/stigma, health service-related barriers -- including distance to\nthe clinic -- and running out of medications ^\\[\\ 5\\ \\]^ , which lead to\nnon-adherence. Many of these barriers are solved with intermittent\nlong-acting injectable drugs.\n\nThis patient developed reactivation of HBV and disseminated MAI\ninfection due to IRIS, a phenomenon believed to be due to an\ninflammatory flare from rapid reconstitution and improvement in immunity\nin the setting of clinically silent microbial antigens or infections\n^\\[\\ 7\\ \\]^ . IRIS can cause a paradoxical worsening of a patient's\nhealth status with fever, night sweats and inflammation despite\nnew-found control of the HIV virus. The pathophysiology of IRIS is\nthought to be linked to an increase in the CD4 T helper and CD8\nT-suppressor cells cell count with a reduction in T regulatory cells\n^\\[\\ 7\\ \\]^ . Known or reported risk factors for IRIS include an initial\nlow CD4 count, disseminated latent infections prior to initiation of\ntherapy and rapid reduction in HIV viral load. This is considered to be\na price that might have to be paid for successful therapy and is\ndifficult to avoid in instances when patients have had low CD4 counts\nfor years, and have not taken prophylaxis well. ART is typically\ncontinued if possible, and a search for occult infection is undertaken.\nThe diagnosis of MAI and HBV reactivation in this patient created new\nchallenges since treatment of most opportunistic infections requires\ngood compliance with multiple medications for a prolonged period of\ntime.\n\nThis case highlights the efficacy of monthly CAB/RPV LA in rapidly\nreducing the HIV viral load level in a poorly controlled patient who\nlacked significant resistance to the two drugs. This is the first known\ncase of IRIS reported in the literature while using CAB/RPV LA. IRIS in\nthe setting of occult MAI is well recognised. It would have likely\noccurred with good adherence to any regimen which rapidly suppressed the\nviral load and is unlikely to be due specifically to CAB/RPV. However,\nCAB/RPV has no activity against HBV, which may have contributed to its\nreactivation. The patient had serologic evidence of resolution of prior\nHBV. However, some patients have covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA)\nthat may remain in hepatocyte nuclei in the long term ^\\[\\ 8\\ ,\\ 9\\ \\]^\n. This patient was monitored closely for an HBV flare and therapy was\npromptly initiated upon recognition. Further study is needed to better\ncharacterise the proper patient selection, dosing interval, monitoring\nand adverse effects of LA CAB/RPV in those with elevated viral loads.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 37399555\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: Of the 2 patients with early virologic failure in the viremic group, 1 patient had a decrease in viral load less than 2 log ~10~ at the first maintenance injection (from 214 540 to 39 293 copies/mL).

A similar case from South Africa has been described, of a treatment experienced patient who developed resistance to DTG after taking DTG 50 mg once a day with rifampicin, instead of the recommended twice daily dosing. Rifampicin is an inducer of the UGT1A1 and CYP3A4 pathways by which DTG is metabolised, resulting in reduced serum DTG concentrations.

Potential changes in trends of MRM and APO-M over-time were\nassessed and predictors of MRM detection or sub-optimal GSS (GSS\\<2) at\nHIV-DNA-GRT were estimated through logistic regression analyses.\n\n### Results\n\nAmong the 1126 individuals included, 396 (35.2%) harboured at least one\nMRM (23.4% to NRTI, 18.8% to NNRTI, 7.7% to PI and 1.4% to INSTI\n\\[N=724\\]); 132 (12.3%) individuals showed a GSS \\<2. APO-M and stop\ncodons were found in 229 (20.3%) and 105 (9.3%) individuals,\nrespectively. APO-DRMs were found in 16.8% of individuals and were more\nlikely observed in those individuals with stop codons (40.0%) compared\nto those without (14.4%, P\\<0.001). From 2010 to 2021 no significant\nchanges of resistance or APO-M were found. Positive predictors of MRM\ndetection at HIV-DNA GRT were drug abuse, subtype B infection, and a\nprolonged and complex treatment history. Perinatal infection and having\nat least 2 stop codons were associated with a current suboptimal\nregimen.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nIn virologically suppressed individuals, resistance in HIV-DNA and the\nextent of APOBEC editing were generally stable in the last decade. A\ncareful evaluation of APOBEC editing might be helpful to improve the\nreliability of HIV-DNA GRT. Further investigations are required to\nunderstand how to apply the estimation of APOBEC editing in refining\ngenotypic evaluation.\n\n\n## 2. Study design\n\n### 2.1. Study population\n\nThis retrospective study included 1126 HIV-1 drug-experienced\nvirologically suppressed subjects with an available HIV-DNA GRT over the\nperiod 2010-2021 performed for routine clinical practice in several\nreference centers in Italy.\n\n### 2.2. HIV-1 DNA extraction and genotyping\n\nHIV-1 DNA was obtained from whole-blood (N=180) or lymphomonocytic cells\n(N=936) after separation from peripheral blood from HIV-1-infected\npatients with a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient, as described previously \\[13\\]\n. HIV-1 DNA was extracted from PBMCs by using a commercially available\nkit (QIAampDNAViral minikit; Qiagen), according to the product\nspecifications. Sanger sequencing was performed as previously described\n\\[ 14 , 15 \\].\n\nResistance interpretation and estimation of APOBEC editing in HIV-DNA\nwere made through Stanford algorithm (HIVdb version 9.1,\nhttps://hivdb.stanford.edu/\n). A sequence was considered affected by APOBEC editing when at least\none APOBEC related mutation (APO-M) or a stop codon (APO-stop) was\ndetected in protease/reverse transcriptase (PR/RT) or integrase . The\npresence of the 18 APOBEC context drug resistance mutations (APO-DRM)\naccording to Stanford HIVdb algorithm was also evaluated.\n\nFor individuals with complete treatment information, the genotypic\nsusceptibility score (GSS) of the current regimen was carried out using\nthe Stanford algorithm. A regimen with GSS\\<2 was defined as suboptimal\nconsidering that it is recommended to switch to a new regimen which\nincludes at least two fully active ARV drugs \\[ 3 , 4 \\].\n\nThe prevalence of resistance was evaluated on the overall population and\naccording to the presence/absence of APO-M or stop codons. The\nprevalence trends of resistance mutations and APOBEC editing were also\nestimated from 2010 to 2021.\n\n### 2.3. Statistical analyses\n\nAll analyses were executed using the SPSS v.26.0 software pack-age for\nWindows (SPSS,Inc., Chicago, IL). Potential difference in resistance\nprevalence according to APOBEC editing was carried out using either\nFisher\\'s exact test or Chi-Squared test for categorical variables when\nappropriate. Chi-Squared test for trend was used to evaluate potential\nchanges in temporal trends of resistance and APOBEC editing in HIV-DNA\nsequences. Demographical, viro-immunological and therapeutic variables\n(listed in Table 5 ) were investigated as potential factors associated\nwith the presence of at least one MRM in HIV-DNA GRT or with suboptimal\nGSS of current regimen by logistic regression models.\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. Patients' characteristics\n\nAt HIV-DNA GRT, individuals were under virological suppression for a\nmedian (IQR) of 3.7 (0.3-8.0) years, and were mainly under triple\ntherapy (66.1%) based on PI, NNRTI or INSTI plus 2 NRTIs ( Table 1 ).\nAround half of them (47.1%) achieved virological suppression under the\nlast regimen and 44.3% had previously received a regimen containing an\nINSTI.\n\n### 3.2. Resistance and APOBEC-editing evaluation\n\nAn overview of resistance and APOBEC-editing detected at HIV-DNA GRT is\nreported in Table 2 . In HIV-DNA GRT, 396 (35.2%) individuals showed at\nleast one MRM. APOBEC editing substitutions were found in 246 (21.8%)\nindividuals; 229 (20.3%) and 105 (9.3%) individuals showed at least one\nAPO-M or stop codon, respectively. Most people showed resistance to one\nclass (22.7%), while a minority harboured strains resistant to at least\n3 drug classes (3.3%) among PI, NRTI, NNRTI and INSTI. Resistance was\nmainly related to NRTI (23.4%) and NNRTI (18.8%), while resistance to PI\nand INSTI was low (7.7%) and marginal (1.4%), respectively. INSTI ARM\nwere found in 16.5% of individuals. Both INSTI MRM and INSTI ARM were\nmore likely observed in sequences with stop codons (P\\<0.05). Concerning\ngenotypic susceptibility of current regimen, 132 (12.3%) individuals\nwere under a suboptimal regimen (GSS\\<2) according to HIV-DNA GRT.\n\nThe highest prevalence of APO-DRM was related to NRTI (9.7%), followed\nby INSTI (4.4%), PI (3.7%) and NNRTI (3.7%). The proportion of\nindividuals harbouring viral strains with APO-DRM was significantly\nhigher in sequence with APO-M or stop codons (P\\<0.05, Table 2 ).\n\nThe proportion of individuals receiving a suboptimal regimen was\nsignificantly higher among those with sequences containing stop codons\n(18.8%) compared to those without stop codons (11.7%, P=0.038).\n\nConcerning specific APO-DRM, 10 out 18 mutations (PI: G73S, D30N; NRTI:\nM184I; NNRTI: M230I, E138K, G190E/S INSTI: G163R, G140R, E138K) were\nmore likely observed in sequences with APOBEC editing ( Table 3 ).\nImportantly, among MRM also listed as APO-DRM, M46I in PR, D67N in RT\nand G140S, G118R and R263K were not associated with presence of APOBEC\nediting.\n\n### 3.3. Trends of resistance and APOBEC editing over the period 2010-2021\n\nApart from some random fluctuations, from 2010 to 2021 no significant\nchanges were found in the proportion of individuals harbouring MRM to\nany drug-class (from 35.7% to 30.8%), to PI (from 5.0% to 6.7%), to NRTI\n(from 17.5% to 17.9%), to NNRTI (from 25.0% to 16.5%), to INI (from 0%\nto 1.6% for MRM; from 11.1% to 16.5% for ARM, Table 4 ). The proportion\nof individuals receiving a suboptimal regimen was moderately low and did\nnot significantly change over time ( Table 4 ).\n\nFrom 2010 to 2021 an increase in the proportion of individuals\nharbouring APO-M (from 7.5% to 20.5%, P=0.055) was found. This increase\nwas mostly observed from 2010 to 2015 (from 7.5% to 21.1%, P=0.010) and\nit was followed by a stable trend from 2016 to 2021 (from 23.3% to\n20.5%, P=0.462). Differently, from 2010 to 2021, no significant changes\nin the proportion of individuals with stop codons (from 7.5% to 4.0%) or\nAPO-DRM to any class both in PR/RT and integrase sequences were observed\nover time ( Table 4 ).\n\n### 3.4. Predictors of resistance at HIV-DNA genotyping\n\nBy multivariable logistic regression models, drug abuse, infection with\nsubtype B strains, and a prolonged and complex treatment history (longer\ntime under cART , higher number of regimens, higher number of\nantiretroviral classes experienced) were independent predictors of\nhaving at least one MRM at HIV-DNA GRT ( Table 5 ). Concerning the GSS\nof the current regimen, individuals with a perinatal/iatrogenic risk\ntransmission factor and having at least 2 stop codons detected in\nHIV-DNA had an increased risk to be under a suboptimal regimen.\nConversely, people who achieved virological suppression under the last\nregimen had a significantly decreased risk to be under a suboptimal\ntreatment ( Table 5 ).\n\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nIn the context of the increasing interest on PBMC genotyping, as far as\nwe know, the present study is the largest available HIV-DNA resistance\nsurvey performed on HIV-1 infected virologically suppressed individuals\nfollowed for clinical routine. Moreover, for the first time temporal\ntrend of archived resistance and the extent of APOBEC editing in HIV-DNA\nwere evaluated. Specifically, in our population, 35% of individuals\nharboured viral strains with drug-resistance in HIV-DNA, mainly related\nto NRTI and NNRTI . It is challenging to compare resistance prevalence\nwith other previous studies. In fact, resistance detected in HIV-DNA was\nvariable due to the fact that most of the available studies were\nperformed in virologically suppressed individuals with heterogenous\ntreatment histories \\[ 7 , 8 , 16 , 17 \\]. Moreover, comparisons are\nchallenging because resistance might be underestimated in HIV-DNA GRT at\nseveral degrees based on number and duration of past virological\nfailures \\[ 5 , 6 \\] ~.~ We found that only 12% of individuals were\nreceiving a suboptimal regimen according with GSS retrieved from HIV-DNA\nGRT. This is an important information that underlines the fact that,\neven though few, virologically suppressed individuals might have a\ncertain frailty related to their current treatment and deserve\nparticular attention.\n\nIn light of concerns regarding reliability of HIV-DNA GRT related to\npotential APOBEC activity, we estimated this phenomenon and we found\nthat, around 20% of individuals tested in this study showed APOBEC\nediting. Again, it is challenging to compare these findings with those\nobserved in previous studies. In fact, few studies, focused on APOBEC\nediting estimation, are available and, most importantly, different\nsequencing platforms and heterogeneous criteria to identify APOBEC\nediting in HIV-DNA sequences were used \\[ 5 , \\[18\\] , \\[19\\] , \\[20\\] ,\n\\[21\\] \\]. Nevertheless, studies based on Sanger sequencing indicated a\nprevalence of hypermutations or stop codons ranging from 6% to 34%\n\\[19\\] , \\[20\\] , \\[21\\] . Concerning the role of APOBEC editing on\nresistance onset, we found that around 17% of individuals showed at\nleast one APO-DRM. However, this apparently high prevalence is the\nsummatory of several APO-DRM that are not always related with APOBEC\nediting. In fact, we found that among the 18 APO DRMs listed in the\nStanford database only 8 were associated with the presence of stop\ncodons ( Table 3 ). Among them, mutations such as G73S in PR and M184I,\nE138K and M230I in RT were already described as related to APOBEC\nactivity \\[22\\] , \\[23\\] , \\[24\\] , thus considering a priori these\nmutations might cause an overestimation of resistance. On the other\nhand, other APO-DRM detected with considerable prevalence such as D67N\n(8.3%) in RT and M46I (2.8%) in PR were not associated with APO-M or\nstop codons; consequently not considering these mutations might\nunderestimate resistance assessment. Prevalence of INSTI APO-DRM was too\nlow to considerably affect GRT reliability, but G163R and G140R were\neffectively detected quite often with stop codons.\n\nThese results suggest that the reliability of HIV-DNA GRT might be\naffected by APOBEC editing, but not all APO-DRM are really associated\nwith APOBEC editing, thus not consider *\"a priori\"* APO-DRMs in\nresistance assessment might affect final evaluation.\n\nWe also evaluated the temporal trends of both resistance, genotypic\nsusceptibility and APOBEC editing. In general, apart from random\nfluctuations, no significant differences in temporal trends were\nobserved from 2010 to 2021. The presence of APO-M increased from 2010 to\n2015 and later the proportion of individuals with them remained stable\nuntil 2021. This might be associated with some bias. In particular,\nbefore 2014 a lower number of HIV-DNA GRT was collected. Furthermore, at\nthat time probably, *\"a priori\",* sequences with APOBEC editing\nmutations were considered with poor reliability and therefore discarded.\n\nSo far no data regarding temporal trends of resistance in HIV-DNA are\navailable, but this stability is in line with those observed in our\nprevious studies in which resistance prevalence observed in plasma GRT\nremained stable after 2010 \\[ 25 , 26 \\].\n\nIn the present study we found that the risk to detect MRM in HIV-DNA is\nassociated with drug abuse and a prolonged/complex previous history, as\npreviously described \\[14\\] . Interestingly, concerning predictors of\ntreatment susceptibility, people who achieved virological suppression\nduring their last regimen showed a decreased risk of receiving a\nsuboptimal regimen. This is expected in a good clinical practice in\nwhich individuals reach a suppressed viremia after switching to a\nregimen chosen according with treatment guidelines \\[ 3 , 4 \\].\nDifferently, people perinatally infected and those with at least 2 stop\ncodons detected in HIV-DNA sequence had an increased risk of receiving\nsuboptimal current treatment. This is not surprising considering that\nperinatally infected individuals had accumulated so much resistance\nduring their long treatment history that it is challenging to build a\nfully active regimen for them \\[26\\] , \\[27\\] , \\[28\\] . Anyway, thanks\nto the modern potent ARVs at high genetic barrier available, they might\nmaintain viral suppression despite the considerable resistance\naccumulated \\[29\\] , \\[30\\] , \\[31\\] . Concerning the role of stop\ncodons in increasing the risk of being under a suboptimal treatment, we\nmight presume that individuals with high level of resistance but more\nthan 2 stop codons can maintain viral suppression because resistant\nstrains are not replication competent. Thus the presence of stop codons\nmight be a marker of \"inactive\" resistance. In this regard, the presence\nof stop codons was already associated with an increased proportion of\nresistance mutations \\[ 20 , 32 \\] and association of stop codons with\nlower viral reservoir \\[18\\] or positive effect on resistant individuals\n\\[33\\] are already described.\n\nThis study might have some limitations. Firstly, HIV-DNA GRT was\nperformed through Sanger technology. This test has a fairly limited\nsensitivity but was the technique used in clinical routine during the\ntime period described. Secondly, we also included individuals without\npoor treatment history, for whom HIV-DNA GRT information was requested\nafter clinicians' decisions, thus potential biases related to missing\ndata typical of observational studies might affect the results obtained.\nMoreover, the lack of HIV-DNA quantification or the estimation of size\nof replication competent proviral DNA (still not recommended and not\nwidely used in clinical practice) did not allow to completely explain\nthe findings about APOBEC editing.\n\nIn conclusion, HIV-DNA sequences collected until 2021 from virologically\nsuppressed individuals, showed that resistance in HIV-DNA is\nconsiderable and stable over time. However, only a limited group of\nindividuals was under a suboptimal regimen despite suppression,\ndemonstrating a good clinical practice based on genotype tailored\ntreatment. In this context, a careful evaluation of APOBEC editing might\nbe helpful to improve the reliability of HIV-DNA GRT. Further\ninvestigations are required to understand how to apply the estimation of\nAPOBEC editing in refining genotypic evaluation.\n\n## Funding\n\nFunding for this study was provided by the Ministry of University and\nResearch , Call 2017, PRIN Project prot. 2017TYTWZ3_002 and AIFA, Call\n2017, AIFA Independent Drug Research project prot.

However, little is known concerning the role these cells play in maintaining persistent HIV-1 during effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). To address this issue, we examined, cellular activation/exhaustion markers (Ki67, CCR5, PD-1, Lag-3 and Tim-3) and viral gag-pol DNA sequences within HLA-DR− and HLA-DR+ memory CD4+ T-cell subsets longitudinally from the peripheral blood of six participants over 3 to ≥15 years of effective therapy. HLA-DR expression was readily detected during the study period in all participants. The average expression levels of CCR5, PD-1 and Tim-3 were higher on the HLA-DR+ T-cell subset whereas the average of LAG-3 expression was higher on their HLA-DR− counterpart. The proportion of HIV-infected cells increased within the HLA-DR+ subset by an average of 18% per year of ART whereas the frequency of infected HLA-DR− T-cells slightly decreased over time (5% per year). We observed that 20--33% of HIV-DNA sequences from the early time points were genetically identical to viral sequences from the last time point within the same cell subset during ART. This indicates that a fraction of proviruses persists within HLA-DR+ and HLA-DR− T-cell subsets during prolonged ART. Our HIV-DNA sequence analyses also revealed that cells transitioned between the HLA-DR+ and HLA-DR− phenotypes. The Ki67 expression, a marker for cellular proliferation, and the combined markers of Ki67/PD-1 averaged 19-fold and 22-fold higher on the HLA-DR+ T-cell subset compared to their HLA-DR− counterpart. Moreover, cellular proliferation, as reflected by the proportion of genetically identical HIV-DNA sequences, increased within both T-cell subsets over the study period; however, this increase was greater within the HLA-DR+ T-cells. Our research revealed that cellular transition and proliferation contribute to the persistence of HIV in HLA-DR+ and HLA-DR− T-cell subsets during prolonged therapy. As such, the HIV reservoir expands during effective ART when both the HLA-DR+ and HLA-DR− cell subsets are included, and therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing the HIV-1 reservoir should target HLA-DR+ and HLA-DR− T-cells.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the persistence of HIV in memory CD4+ T-cells and the genetic analysis of HIV-DNA sequences.

The mean age of the participants was calculated to be 32.21 yr and over half of the patients (n=16) were male and the mean time of HARRT use was 47.69 months.  Standard first-line regimen in Iran is comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI);  drug resistance mutations for the 3 classes of ART (NNRTI, NRTI, and PI) were observed and 4 samples showed resistance to all of them.\nRationale: The paper mentions the patients got standard treatment, and the evidence indicates the presence of mutations associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, suggesting that individuals in the study had received these drug classes prior to sample sequencing.\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI\n\nPMID: 36146776\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: Monitoring HIV-1 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs) is important for disease surveillance. Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

Real-world data on\nthe virologic effectiveness of co-formulated\nbictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF) among PWH\nwith virologic failure while receiving other ART remain sparse.\n\n### Methods\n\nWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of PWH who had viral\nrebound with plasma HIV RNA \\>1000 copies/mL and were switched to either\ndolutegravir combined with 2 NRTIs or BIC/FTC/TAF. The primary end point\nwas re-achieving viral suppression within the first 48 weeks of switch.\nThe association between NRTI-related resistance-associated mutations\n(RAMs) and virologic effectiveness was examined.\n\n### Results\n\nSeventy-nine PWH with viral rebound while receiving other antiretroviral\nregimens were included. Within the first 48 weeks of switch, the overall\nprobability of re-achieving viral suppression was 79.7% (82.5% \\[33/40\\]\nand 76.9% \\[30/39\\] for BIC/FTC/TAF and dolutegravir-based regimens,\nrespectively, p = 0.78). PWH with a higher CD4 lymphocyte count\n(adjusted odds ratio, per 100-cell/mm ^3^ increase, 1.41; 95% confidence\ninterval, 1.02--1.95) were more likely to re-achieve viral suppression.\nAmong PWH switching to BIC/FTC/TAF who had pre-existing RAMs to NRTIs\nbefore switch, 14 of 15 (93.3%) successfully achieved viral suppression.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nSwitching to BIC/FTC/TAF and dolutegravir-based regimens could\nre-achieve viral suppression in four-fifth of the PWH who experienced\nviral rebound during treatment with other antiretroviral regimens.\nPre-existing NRTI-related RAMs did not have adverse impact on the\neffectiveness of dolutegravir combined with 2 NRTIs or BIC/FTC/TAF.\n\n\n## Material and methods\n\n### Study design and patients\n\nThis was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted in the\nNational Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). PWH who were aged ≥20 years\nand received HIV care with at least 3 months of ART prescription between\n1 January 2016 and 30 March 2022 were eligible for the study. For\neligible PWH, available results of plasma HIV RNA load (PVL) were\nretrieved from the electronic medical record database (National Taiwan\nUniversity Hospital-Integrated Medical Database; NTUH-IMD). We then\nscreened these PWH to identify those who were receiving ART and had ever\nachieved viral suppression (defined as PVL \\<50 copies/mL) before\ndeveloping viral rebound (defined as PVL \\>1000 copies/mL). PWH who did\nnot have clinic visits or drug refills within the 6 months prior to\ntheir viral rebound were excluded. PWH who experienced viral rebound but\nremained on the same background antiretroviral regimens were also\nexcluded. Among those eligible PWH, we included those who switched from\ntheir original background ART to a second-generation INSTI-based ART\n(either BIC/FTC/TAF or DTG plus 2 NRTIs). All included PWH were followed\nsince the day of switch (to either BIC/FTC/TAF or DTG-based regimens)\nuntil the date of their last available PVL testing before a censoring\nevent occurred. Censoring events in this analysis included changes made\nto the core agents (BIC or DTG) of ART, death, loss to follow-up (no\nclinics visits or drug refills for \\>6 months) or the end of observation\n(30 March 2022), whichever occurred first.\n\nAccording to the national HIV treatment guidelines in Taiwan, PWH are\nadvised to receive determinations of PVL and CD4 cell count at least\nevery 3--6 months for those on stable ART, with additional testing in\nthe presence of virologic rebound or ART switch. During the observation\nperiod, quantification of PVL was performed using the Cobas® Amplicor\nHIV-1 Monitor Test (Cobas® Amplicor v.1.5; Roche Diagnostics,\nIndianapolis, IN, USA) with a lower detection limit of 20 (1.3 log ~10~\n) copies/mL. The demographic and clinical variables, including age, sex,\ndate of HIV diagnosis, date of outpatient clinics and ART prescriptions,\nPVL, CD4 lymphocyte counts and other laboratory results were also\nretrieved from the NTUH-IMD.\n\nWe also collected the available reports of HIV genotypic resistance\ntesting of included PWH. In Taiwan, genotypic resistance testing is\nperformed before initiation of first-line therapy for the purpose of\nsurveillance or at the time of virologic failure on an as-needed basis\nat several designated hospitals and Taiwan Centers for Disease Control.\nFor PWH who had available genotypic resistance reports, their archived\nRAMs to NRTIs or INSTIs before the switch was reviewed and the genotypic\nresistance scores (GSSs) were determined using the Stanford HIV Drug\nResistance Database. 11 , 12 , 13 Each antiretroviral agent would be\nassigned with a score of 0 (high-level resistance), 0.25\n(intermediate-level resistance), 0.50 (low-level resistance), 0.75\n(potential low-level resistance) or 1 (susceptible). The study was\napproved by the Research Ethics Committee of the hospital (registration\nnumber, 202205040RINB) and informed consent was waived due to the\nretrospective study design and decoding of the personal identifiers.\n\n### Study end points\n\nThe primary end point was the proportion of PWH who re-achieved and\nmaintained viral suppression, defined as PVL \\<50 copies/mL, within the\nfirst 48 weeks of switch to either BIC/FTC/TAF or DTG-based regimens.\nPWH who had a censoring event before week 48 would be considered to have\nre-achieved viral suppression if they could achieve viral suppression\nand maintain PVL \\<50 copies/mL until the censoring event. Secondary end\npoints included the probabilities of re-achieving viral suppression\nwithin the first 48 weeks for the two subgroups receiving BIC/FTC/TAF or\nDTG-based regimens. Furthermore, the proportions of re-achieving viral\nsuppression beyond 48 weeks were also estimated, with two different\ndefinitions by either a strict (PVL \\<50 copies/mL) or more lenient PVL\nthreshold (PVL \\<200 copies/mL). For the included PWH with available\narchived data of RAMs before switch, the association between GSS and\nviral suppression was also analyzed.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nDemographic and clinical characteristics were reported for the included\nPWH, with additional comparisons between those who were switched to the\nBIC/FTC/TAF and those who were switched to DTG-based ART.\nNon-categorical variables were compared using Student\\'s t-test or\nMann--Whitney U-test, and categorical variables were compared using χ2\ntest or Fisher\\'s exact test . Kaplan--Meier plots were used to compare\nthe durations needed to re-achieve viral suppression between the two\nregimens. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were\ncreated to adjust for confounders and to identify potential factors\nassociated with re-achieving viral suppression after switch to\nINSTI-based second-line therapy. In the multivariate analysis , we\nconstructed the logistic regression model using a backward stepwise\nelimination process, in which all possible relevant variables were\nincluded in the model initially. The variable with the largest P-value\nwas then removed from the model. The process was repeated until all\nfactors in the model had a P-value of \\<0.2. Statistical analyses were\nperformed using STATA software version 14.0 S/E (Stata Corp., College\nStation, TX, USA). All P-values were two-sided.\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Study population\n\nDuring the study period, we identified 79 PWH who met the criteria of\nviral rebound and switched to second-generation INSTI-containing\nregimens ( Fig. 1 ). Of them, 40 PWH switched to BIC/FTC/TAF (BIC group)\nand 39 PWH to DTG-based ART (DTG group). The median observation duration\nwas 89 weeks (interquartile range \\[IQR\\], 39--118 weeks), which was not\nsignificantly different between the two groups of included PWH (95 weeks\n\\[IQR, 63--114\\] for BIC group and 70 weeks \\[IQR, 30--123\\] for DTG\ngroup; p = 0.39). The comparisons of baseline characteristics between\nthe two groups of included PWH are shown in Table 1 .\n\n\nCompared with PWH in the DTG group, those in the BIC group had a\nsignificantly lower median CD4 lymphocyte count before switch (390 vs\n232 cells/mm ^3^ , p = 0.049) and longer duration of HIV diagnosis\n(median, 4 vs 8 years, p = 0.007). Most PWH (82.1%) in the DTG group\nswitched from NNRTI-based ART to DTG-based regimens, while 75% of the\nPWH in the BIC group were receiving a first-generation INSTI-based ART\nbefore switch. The proportions of PWH having available genotypic\nresistance profiles and the distributions of NRTI-related RAMs were\nsimilar for both groups, though PWH in the BIC group were more likely to\nhave INSTI-related RAMs.\n\n### Virologic response\n\nAccording to our definition, the overall probability of re-achieving\nviral suppression within the first 48 weeks after ART switch was 79.7%\n(63/79) of the included PWH. There was no statistically significant\ndifference in re-achieving viral suppression between the two groups\nwithin 48 weeks (82.5% \\[33/40\\] for PWH in the BIC group and 76.9%\n\\[30/39\\] for those in the DTG group; p = 0.78). The intervals between\nART switch and viral re-suppression are compared in Fig. 2 , which did\nnot significantly differ between the two groups.\n\nWhen extending the observation beyond 48 weeks, 71 (89.9%) of the\nincluded PWH had re-achieved and maintained viral suppression below 50\ncopies/mL during the entire observation period (95.0% \\[38/40\\] for PWH\nin the BIC group and 84.6% \\[33/39\\] for those in the DTG group,\np = 0.15) before any censoring events occurred. If we used a more\nlenient threshold of viral suppression (PVL \\<200 copies/mL), the\nproportion of viral re-suppression during the entire observation period\nwas 92.4% (95.0% \\[38/40\\] for PWH in the BIC group and 89.7% \\[35/39\\]\nfor those in the DTG group, p = 0.43). The detailed sequential changes\nof PVL after switching to either regimen are demonstrated in Fig. S1 .\n\nOverall, seven (17.5%) PWH in the BIC group and nine (23.1%) in the DTG\ngroup did not achieve virologic suppression within the first 48 weeks of\nswitching. In the BIC group, two out of the seven PWH who failed to\nachieve virologic suppression were lost to follow-up before week 48,\nwhile the remaining five continued bictegravir-based ART and eventually\nachieved virologic suppression. Similarly, four PWH who failed to\nachieve virologic suppression in the DTG group were lost to follow-up\nbefore week 48, and the remaining four were continued on\ndolutegravir-based ART and eventually achieved virologic suppression;\nand only one PWH remained HIV viremic after week 48 and was switched to\nboosted darunavir-based ART at week 70. Out of these 16 PWH, five\nunderwent genotypic resistance testing, and no emerging RAMs to NRTIs or\nINSTIs were detected.\n\nIn multivariate logistic regression model, the only factor associated\nwith re-achieving viral suppression within 48 weeks was baseline CD4\nlymphocyte counts before switch (adjusted odds ratio, per 100-cell/mm\n^3^ increase, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.02--1.95). Choice of core agents of ART\n(BIC vs DTG) was not associated with the probability of re-achieving\nviral suppression in both univariate and multivariate analysis .\n\n### Archived RAM and the effectiveness of BIC/FTC/TAF\n\nIn our cohort, 70 of 79 (88.6%) included PWH had available genotypic\nresistance data prior to the switch to BIC/FTC/TAF or DTG-based\nantiretroviral regimens; and 32 of them (45.7%) had documented archived\nRAMs to NRTIs or INSTIs. Of these 32 PWH, 93.8% had NRTI-related RAMs\nand 78.1% were known to have HIV-1 harboring M184V/I mutation before\nswitch. Only two PWH in the DTG group had RAMs conferring high-level\nresistance to tenofovir , such as K65R. In terms of RAMs to INSTIs, two\nPWH had HIV-1 harboring RAMs that are predicted to confer potential\nlow-level resistance to BIC (one with S147G and one with E92Q mutation)\nand one PWH had HIV-1 harboring RAMs that were predicted to confer\nintermediate-level resistance (with a combination of Q148R and N155H)\n(13). However, despite the presence of RAMs to NRTIs or INSTIs, only 4\nPWH with archived RAMs (1 with BIC/FTC/TAF and 3 with DTG-based\nregimens) failed to re-achieve viral suppression after switch. The\noverall virologic responses after switch for those with archived RAM are\nlisted in Table 2 . Both regimens demonstrated a high probability of\nre-achieving viral suppression (15/16 \\[93.8%\\] for PWH in the BIC group\nand 13/16 \\[81.3%\\] for those in the DTG group, p = 0.6). Furthermore,\nthe predicted GSS was not associated with virologic success after switch\nfor both groups.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this retrospective cohort study , we examined the virologic\neffectiveness of second-generation INSTI-based ART for PWH who had\nexperienced viral rebound with a PVL \\>1000 copies/mL while receiving\nprevious antiretroviral regimens. In our cohort, 79.7% (63/79) of\nincluded PWH re-achieved viral suppression within the first 48 weeks of\nART switch. The proportions of re-achieving viral suppression within 48\nweeks after ART switch were not statistically significantly different\nbetween the two groups (82.5% \\[33/40\\] for those switching to\nBIC/FTC/TAF vs. 76.9% \\[30/39\\] for those switching to DTG-based\nregimens).\n\nOur finding demonstrating the virologic effectiveness of\nsecond-generation INSTI-based regimens for PWH who required salvage\ntherapy is consistent with the findings in the DAWNING and NADIA trials.\nBoth trials demonstrated that DTG-based ART was at least non-inferior to\nboosted PI among PWH with virologic failure to NNRTI-based regimens. ^5^\n^,^ ^6^ However, unlike DTG-based regimens, the clinical evidence\nsupporting the use of BIC/FTC/TAF as salvage therapy remains scarce. In\na case series with 50 PWH with pre-existing NRTI-related RAMs, Shafran\net al. reported a high proportion of treatment success after switching\nto BIC/FTC/TAF, with 49 of 50 (98.0%) included PWH remaining virally\nsuppressed after a median follow-up of 18.6 months. ^14^ However, only\n8% of the PWH included in the study was HIV viremic before switch. In\nanother retrospective cohort study from Spain, the virologic\neffectiveness among 506 treatment-experienced PWH was examined. In this\ncohort, 66 (13.4%) PWH were switched to BIC/FTC/TAF with a PVL above 50\ncopies/mL (15). The authors also demonstrated a high rate of virologic\nsuppression, with 83% PWH achieving virologic suppression at week 48.\nHowever, the specific results regarding viremic PWH before switch were\nnot reported in the study.\n\nIn our study, 30 PWH had archived NRTI-related RAMs before switching to\nsecond-generation INSTI-based ART, with 25 with HIV-1 harboring M184V\nmutation, and 22 (73.3%) PWH were able to successfully re-achieve viral\nsuppression ( Table 2 ). No significant difference was observed between\nBIC group and DTG group in terms of viral suppression. This finding was\nin line with that of NADIA trial, in which the inclusion of NRTIs with\nno predicted activity in the regimens was not associated with virologic\nfailure in participants receiving DTG-based ART as salvage therapy. ^6^\nPrevious studies focusing on DTG-based ART also demonstrated that\npre-existing NRTI-related RAMs did not have adverse impact on virologic\nsuppression after stable switch. ^16^ The discrepancies between the\npredicted activities and real-life effectiveness could probably be\nexplained by the impairment of viral fitness or replicative capacity of\nHIV-1 in the presence of NRTI-related RAMs. 17 , 18 , 19 Aside from\nadding to the evidence supporting the effectiveness of DTG in the\npresence of NRTI-related RAM, this study and our previous study also\ndemonstrated BIC/FTC/TAF might also possess similarly high antiviral\nactivities in PWH with HIV-1 harboring NRTI-related RAMs. ^20^ Another\nSpanish cohort study including 69 PWH with pre-existing NRTI-related\nRAMs before switching to BIC/FTC/TAF also demonstrated that 88.4% of\nthem achieved virologic suppression at week 48; however, only 8 PWH\n(11.6%) in the cohort had PVL above 50 copies/mL before switch. ^15^ It\nis noteworthy that one of our PWH successfully re-achieved viral\nsuppression despite presence of RAMs to INSTI that might confer\nintermediate-level resistance to BIC prior to switch. The preexisting\nRAMs to INSTIs before switch likely arose from previous exposure to\nfirst-generation INSTIs such as raltegravir and cobicistat-boosted\nelvitegravir . The explanation to this finding is unclear, but it might\nbe related to the high genetic barrier and higher BIC concentration\nachieved during daily dosing. ^21^ It is important to note that, in the\nNADIA trial, more PWH who failed to achieve viral suppression with\nDTG-based regimen had emergence of RAMs to INSTIs compared with boosted\ndarunavir-based regimens. However, no genotypic resistance testing was\nperformed for PWH included in our study after ART switch. Therefore, it\nwas not clear whether similar risk of emergence of INSTI resistance\nwould occur in PWH switching to BIC/FTC/TAF as salvage therapy. More\nstudies of larger sample sizes and longer durations of follow-up are\nwarranted to better understand the role of BIC/FTC/TAF as salvage\ntherapy in PWH harboring RAMs to INSTIs that confer low-to\nintermediate-level resistance.\n\nOur study had several limitations and our findings should be interpreted\nwith necessary caution. The study was based on data retrospectively\nextracted from electronic medical database of a university hospital and,\ntherefore, the timing and reason of virologic failure could not be\nconfirmed for all included PWH and the indication and timing of ART\nswitch might vary with different healthcare providers. Therefore, we\nattempted to reduce the risks of confounding by clearly defining the\ninclusion criteria and primary end point using PVL criteria.\nFurthermore, due to the retrospective study design and impact of\nCOVID-19 epidemics in Taiwan during the observation period, ^22^ ^,^\n^23^ clinic visits and PVL testing had become very irregular for some\nPWH in our cohort and we were unable to perform a standard FDA snapshot\nanalysis due to the irregular timing of PVL testing during the\nobservation period. Finally, limited by the small sample size, the\ncomparisons between BIC and DTG groups were very likely underpowered and\nsubgroup analyses with PWH harboring different combinations of archived\nRAMs were not performed. Moreover, our study included only\ntreatment-experienced PWH with virologic failure and our findings might\nnot be generalizable to treatment-naïve PWH or virally-suppressed PWH in\nconsideration of choosing an alternative antiretroviral regimen.\n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated in this retrospective study\nincluding PWH with viral rebound during antiretroviral treatment that\nthe virologic effectiveness with BIC/FTC/TAF was similar to that with\nDTG-based therapy, when prescribed as salvage regimens. Moreover, a high\nproportion of PWH with archived NRTI-related RAMs could re-achieve viral\nsuppression with either BIC/FTC/TAF or DTG-based ART.\n\n## Funding\n\nThis research was supported by the Centers for Diseases Control, Taiwan\n(grant number: MOHW112-CDC-C-114-000103 ).\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 36728219\nQuestion ID: 14\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?\nEvidence: The vast majority of PWH (98.4%, n = 552/561) were established on a wide range of antiretroviral therapies (ART) at the time of DTG-2DR switch or continuation.

We here evaluated the\nprevalence of archived RPV-RAMs in a cohort of people living with HIV\n(PWH).\n\n### Methods\n\nWe analysed near full-length HIV-1 *pol* sequences from proviral DNA for\nthe presence of RPV-RAMs, which were defined according to the 2022\nIAS--USA drug resistance mutation list and Stanford HIV drug resistance\ndatabase.\n\n### Results\n\nRPV-RAMs were identified in 757/5805 sequences, giving a prevalence of\n13.0% (95% CI 12%--13.9%). Amongst the ART-naive group, 137/1281 (10.7%,\n95% CI 9.1%--12.5%) had at least one RPV-RAM. Of the 4524 PWH with viral\nsuppression on ART (VL \\<400 copies/mL), 620 (13.7%, 95% CI\n12.7%--14.7%) had at least one RPV-RAM. E138A was the most prevalent\nRPV-RAM in the ART-naive group (7.9%) and the ART-suppressed group\n(9.3%). The rest of the mutations observed (L100I, K101E, E138G, E138K,\nE138Q, Y181C, H221Y, M230L, A98G, V179D, G190A, G190E and M230I) were\nbelow a prevalence of 1%.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nRPV-RAMs were present in 10.7% of ART-naive and 13.7% of ART-suppressed\nPWH in Botswana. The most common RPV-RAM in both groups was E138A. Since\nindividuals with the E138A mutation may be more likely to fail\ncabotegravir/rilpivirine, monitoring RPV-RAMs will be crucial for\neffective cabotegravir/rilpivirine implementation in this setting.\n\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Selection of study participants\n\nStudy participants were recruited from a large community HIV incidence\ntrial described elsewhere that enrolled participants aged 16 to 64\nyears, followed for 30 months from 2013 to 2018. ^15^ In this analysis,\nwe included a total of 5805 (95.5%) proviral sequences from Botswana\nCombination Prevention Project (BCPP) participants, of which 1281\nproviral DNA sequences were obtained from the treatment-naive\nindividuals, and 4524 were from ART-experienced participants with HIV-1\nVL ≤400 copies/mL (Figure ​ (Figure1). 1 ). We did not include sequences\nfor individuals experiencing virological failure since LA\ncabotegravir/rilpivirine is currently recommended only for virologically\nsuppressed adults (HIV-1 RNA \\<50 copies/mL), and is not currently\nrecommended for people with virological failure. ^16^ To control for the\nimpact of archived HIV proviral DNA mutations, an ART-naive group was\nused. Hence the main objective of this study was to identify HIV drug\nresistance mutations using proviral DNA sequences from HIV-infected\nART-naive and ART-suppressed individuals in Botswana.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nFlow chart of participants used to determine the prevalence of RPV-RAMs.\n\n### Near full-length HIV genotyping\n\nHIV-1 proviral DNA sequences were generated using next-generation\nsequencing (NGS) as previously described elsewhere. ^15^ Briefly, a\nlong-range HIV genotyping protocol was used to generate viral sequences\nand the first-round amplicon was subjected to the Illumina sequencing\nsystem. The NGS was performed at the Biopolymers Facility at Harvard\nMedical School ( https://genome.med.harvard.edu/ ) or by the PANGEA HIV\nconsortium at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (\nhttp://www.sanger.ac.uk/ ) utilizing Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq platforms.\nA single consensus sequence represented the population of viral\nquasispecies per each participant. ^17^ Minor viral variants were not\nanalysed.\n\n### HIV-1 subtyping\n\nThe HIV-1 genotypic subtypes were determined using REGA version 3 ^18^\nand COMET ^19^ online subtyping tools. ^17^ More than 99.9% of the\nscreened samples had HIV-1C sequences, ^17^ and only HIV-1C sequences\nwere used in this analysis.\n\n### Drug resistance mutations and interpretation\n\nRPV-RAMs were described according to the 2022 updated IAS-USA\ndrug-resistance mutation list ^20^ and the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance\nDatabase ( http://hivdb.stanford.edu ). The level of rilpivirine\nresistance was predicted according to the Stanford HIV DRM penalty\nscores and resistance interpretation. ^21^ All sequences with low-level,\nintermediate- level and high-level resistance according to Stanford and\nIAS algorithms were considered to have RPV-RAMs. The prevalence of\nRPV-RAMs was estimated in ART-naive individuals and in virally\nsuppressed (HIV-1 RNA ≤400 copies/mL) individuals on ART. RPV-RAMs and\ntheir modes of action are shown in Table ​ Table1 1 .\n\n\n### Identification of hypermutated sequences\n\nThe Los Alamos Hypermut 2.0 program for hypermutations (\nhttps://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HYPERMUT/hypermut.html ) was\nused to assess for hypermutations, and identified mutations that could\nbe a result of hypermutations were excluded. ^29^\n\n### Statistical analyses\n\nCharacteristics of the participants were described using proportions\nwith 95% CI and medians with IQR or percentages. Fisher's exact test was\nused to compare categorical variables among ART status groups. *P*\nvalues of \\<0.05 were considered significant. All statistical analyses\nwere conducted using STATA software version 15.1 (Stata Corporation,\nCollege Station, TX, USA).\n\n### Ethical considerations\n\nThe BCPP study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) at\nthe US CDC and the Botswana Health Research and Development Committee\nIRB and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT01965470 ). The study\nwas carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki's guiding\nprinciples. All BCPP participants provided written informed consent for\nthe use of their samples in future studies.\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Study participants\n\nThis analysis included a dataset of 5805 sequences, of which 1281 (22%)\nwere obtained from treatment-naive PWH, and the other 4524 (78%) were\nfrom ART-suppressed PWH (Figure ​ (Figure1). 1 ). Among the ART-naive\nPWH, 856 (66.8%) were female, with a median age of 33 years (IQR:\n27--42). Among the ART-suppressed PWH, 3267 (72.2%) were female, with a\nmedian age of 40 years (IQR 34--48) and 1257 (27.8%) were male, with the\nmedian age of 44 years (IQR 38--52) (Table ​ (Table2). 2 ). The most\ncommon ART regimens used were efavirenz + emtricitabine + tenofovir\n(EFV/FTC/TDF) ( *n* = 1792; 39.6%), lamivudine + nevirapine + zidovudine\n(3TC/NVP/ZDV) ( *n* = 719; 15.9%) and\nlamivudine + efavirenz + zidovudine (3TC/EFV/ZDV) ( *n* = 621; 13.7%).\n\n### Overall prevalence of RPV-RAMs\n\nBefore the exclusion of hypermutants, the total prevalence of RPV-RAMs\nwas 21.0% (1218/5805). Prior to the exclusion of hypermutants, 21.3%\n(962/4524) of ART-suppressed individuals had RPV-RAMs, while 20.0%\n(256/1281) of ART-naive individuals had RPV-RAMs. After exclusion of\nhypermutants, RPV-RAMs were identified in 757/5805 sequences, giving a\nprevalence of 13.0% (95% CI 12%--13.9%). The overall prevalence of\nRPV-RAMs after exclusion of hypermutants (13%; 757/5805) was\nstatistically different from before hypermutants were excluded (21%;\n1218/5805) ( *P* = \\<0.01). From now on we refer to RPV-RAMs after\nexclusion of hypermutants. There were no statistically significant\ndifferences in the overall frequency of RPV-RAMs in females \\[532/4123;\n12.9% (95% CI: 11.9--13.9)\\] and males \\[225/1682; 13.4% (95% CI:\n11.7--15.0)\\] PWH ( *P* = 0.637). There was a statistically significant\ndifference in the prevalence of RPV-RAMs in ART-naive individuals\n\\[137/1281; 10.7% (95% CI: 9.1--12.5)\\] compared with ART-suppressed\nindividuals \\[620/4524; 13.7% (95% CI: 12.7--14.7)\\] ( *P* = 0.005)\n(Figure ​ (Figure2 2 ).\n\nFigure 2.\n\nPercentages of individuals with RPV-RAMs by treatment category. Bars\nrepresent the 95% CI. This figure appears in colour in the online\nversion of *JAC* and in black and white in the print version of *JAC* .\n\n### RPV-RAMs in ART-naive participants\n\nThe prevalence of RPV-RAMs among ART-naive males and females was 11.3%\n(48/425) and 10.4% (89/856), respectively; *P* \\< 0.632. The most\nprevalent RPV-RAMs among the ART-naive individuals were E138A ( *n*\n= 101; 7.9%) followed by M230I and G190E ( *n* = 7; 0.55%) and lastly\nK101E, A98G and G190A, occurring at equal prevalence ( *n* = 6; 0.5%)\n(Figure ​ (Figure3). 3 ). Mutations E138G, E138K, V179D, Y181C, L100I,\nE138Q and H221Y were detected in fewer than 0.5% of the sequences (Table\nS1 , available as Supplementary data at *JAC* Online). The most frequent\nrilpivirine combinations in ART-naive individuals were E138A + V179E and\nE138K + K101E, both at 0.31% ( *n* = 4), and E138A + V179D ( *n* = 3;\n0.23%).\n\nFigure 3.\n\nDistribution of mutations associated with RPV-RAMs among ART-naive and\nART-suppressed individuals. This figure appears in colour in the online\nversion of *JAC* and in black and white in the print version of *JAC* .\n\nOne hundred and six (8.3%) ART-naive participants demonstrated low-level\nresistance to rilpivirine, 1.2% ( *n* = 15) of participants demonstrated\nintermediate resistance and 1.2% ( *n* = 16) of participants\ndemonstrated high-level resistance (Table ​ (Table3 3 ).\n\n### RPV-RAMs in ART-suppressed participants\n\nOf the 620 ART-suppressed individuals with RPV-RAMs, 14.1% (177/1257)\nwere male and 13.6% (443/3267) were female; *P* = 0.664. Among\nART-suppressed individuals, the most prevalent RPV-RAMs were E138A ( *n*\n= 419; 9.3%), K101E ( *n* = 23; 0.51%), Y181C ( *n* = 27; 0.60%), M230I\n( *n* = 54; 1.19%), V179D ( *n* = 34; 0.75%) and G190A ( *n* = 22;\n0.49%) (Figure ​ (Figure3). 3 ). The rest of the mutations detected had a\nprevalence of less than 0.5% (L100I, K101P, E138G, E138K, E138Q, Y181I,\nY188L, H221Y, M230L, A98G, V106A, G190E and G190S (Table S1 ). The most\nfrequent rilpivirine combinations among ART-suppressed individuals were\nE138A + M230I ( *n* = 9; 0.20%), E138A + V179D ( *n* = 17; 0.38%),\nE138A + K101E ( *n* = 7; 0.15%), E138A + V179E ( *n* = 2; 0.04%),\nE138K + K101E ( *n* = 3; 0.07%) and K103N + L100I ( *n* = 2; 0.04%).\n\nAmong ART-suppressed individuals, 0.57% ( *n* = 26) of sequences with\nresistance to rilpivirine were classified as being potential low-level\nresistance; 9.4% ( *n* = 424) were classified as having low-level\nresistance; 2.8% ( *n* = 125) were classified as having intermediate\nresistance and 1.0% ( *n* = 45) as with high resistance (Table ​ (Table3\n3 ).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study presents the first data on the prevalence of RPV-RAMs among\nART-naive and virologically suppressed PWH on ART in Botswana. RPV-RAMs\nwere present in proviral samples from 10.7% ART-naive and 13.7%\nART-suppressed PWH in Botswana, with E138A being the most common RPV-RAM\nin both groups. Archived E138A and other RPV-RAMs may contribute to\nvirological failure in ART-suppressed individuals switching to LA\ncabotegravir/rilpivirine injectables, which is a priority for the\nBotswana ART Programme in the near future.\n\nOverall, the 13.0% of sequences with RPV-RAMs in our study was similar\nto the 12.5% of RPV-RAMs reported by Theys *et al.* ^30^ among 4631\nHIV-1 ART-naive individuals in Belgium, the 14.5% reported by Cecchini\n*et al.* ^31^ among 112 HIV-infected pregnant women, and the 12.3%\nreported in South Africa among treatment-naive and experienced\nindividuals. ^32^ This prevalence is lower than other studies that\nreported a prevalence of 32% RAMs detected in 41 individuals who\npreviously had virological failure and were later suppressed, ^33^ and\n46% in 140 individuals with confirmed virological failure. ^34^ The\nobserved differences between our study and studies by Gallien *et al.*\nand Kingoo *et al.* could be explained by the fact that, in contrast to\nthem, we used ART-suppressed and ART-naive individuals whereas they used\nART-experienced individuals with confirmed virological failure. Our\nfindings are also comparable to those of a study from Argentina that\nshowed a 14.3% overall prevalence of rilpivirine resistance (18.3% for\nART-experienced individuals and 9.6% for ART-naive individuals. ^31^\n\nDrug resistance mutations have been found to be common in individuals\nexperiencing virological failure in other settings, and their\naccumulation threatens the effectiveness of future treatment.\n^35\\ ,\\ 36^ The RPV-RAMs in our cohort can be explained by the previous\nuse of efavirenz and nevirapine in this population, as these\nfirst-generation NNRTIs have cross-resistance with rilpivirine. ^37--41^\nIn ART-naive individuals, RPV-RAMs might have been selected by NNRTI use\nand then transmitted to these individuals. NNRTI drug resistance levels\nneed to be monitored as they may jeopardize the efficacy of future\ninjectable agents due to the possibility of continued transmission of\nHIV-1 variants with NNRTI resistance.\n\nE138A was the most common rilpivirine mutation both in ART-naive (7.9%)\nand ART-suppressed (9.3%) individuals, and typically decreases\nrilpivirine susceptibility by approximately 2-fold. ^42^ E138A is a\ndocumented cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutation associated with\nhuman leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B\\*18 and was found to significantly\nincrease rilpivirine resistance. ^43\\ ,\\ 44^ The escape from CTL immune\nresponses could be part of the reason for the increase in the prevalence\nof E138A in some populations. In our study, the prevalence of E138A in\nART-naive individuals is close to the mutation's global prevalence of\nHIV-1C (6.1%). ^45^ This study demonstrates that E138A was responsible\nfor more than half of the prevalence of RPV-RAMs. A high prevalence of\nE138A was also previously noted in PWH failing ART earlier on in\nBotswana, ^46^ which is consistent with our current findings. Published\nliterature also indicates that the E138A mutation contributes to the\nhigh prevalence of RAMs in other settings. ^47^ In a study by Swindells\n*et al.* , ^5^ in 2020, E138A was detected in three participants at the\ntime of virological failure. Archived E138A was also present in five of\nthe eight participants with confirmed virological failure in every 8\nweeks dosing group. ^48^ These findings show that the presence of\narchived E138A at baseline is one of the predictors of\ncabotegravir/rilpivirine failure. The prevalence of the E138A mutation\nshould be interpreted with caution as more data on the effect of the\nE138A mutation alone on rilpivirine susceptibility are still being\ninvestigated and more cabotegravir/rilpivirine clinical trials need to\nbe conducted in settings with high E138A mutation prevalence to\ndetermine the impact of the mutation on clinical outcomes.\n\nWe observed a low prevalence of other RPV-RAMs detected in our cohort in\nART-naive and ART-suppressed individuals, ranging from 0.02% to 1.19%\n(L100I, K101E, K101P, E138G, E138K, E138Q, Y181C, Y181I, Y188L, H221Y,\nM230I, M230L, A98G, V106A, V179D, G190A, G190E and G190S). In our\ncohort, the RPV-RAMs K101P, Y181I, Y188L, M230L, V106A and G190S were\nabsent in ART-naive groups. The prevalence of K101E, E138K and A98G was\nsimilar in the ART-naive and ART-suppressed individuals at 0.5%, 0.4%\nand 0.5%, respectively. Even though having rilpivirine proviral\ngenotypic RAMs was one of the factors associated with virological\nfailure in the ATLAS, FLAIR and ATLAS-2M studies, ^9^ a very small\npopulation of ART-suppressed individuals with these mutations would\nlikely experience virological failure if they were switched to LA\ncabotegravir/rilpivirine.\n\nHigh-level resistance (Stanford penalty score of 60) was reported in\n0.8% of ART-naive individuals compared with 0.6% of ART-suppressed\nparticipants. Four ART-naive individuals showed a combination of\nmutations scored as high-level resistance, E138K + K101E ( *n* = 4;\n0.31%, 95% CI 0.09--0.80). Available evidence suggests that E138K in\ncombination with K101E may reduce rilpivirine susceptibility about\n3-fold. ^49^ In the ART-suppressed group, 10 participants showed a\ncombination of mutations scored as high-level resistance: E138A + K101E\n( *n* = 7; 0.15%, 95% CI 0.06--0.32), E138K + K101E ( *n* = 3; 0.007%,\n95% CI 0.014--0.20) and K103N + L100I ( *n* = 2; 0.04%, 95% CI\n0.0042--0.124). L100I in combination with K103N causes 10-fold reduced\nsusceptibility to rilpivirine. ^50^\n\n## Limitations of the study\n\nSamples used in this study were from 2013--18 before the widespread use\nof dolutegravir-based ART in Botswana; thus, findings might not be\nrepresentative of the current prevalence of RPV-RAMs in Botswana.\nHowever, since ART rollout during this period in Botswana was quite\nhigh, ^51^ it is unlikely that there is much difference in the archived\nHIV-1 mutations in the samples from the study period and now. Our\nanalysis only focused on RPV-RAMs and did not include cabotegravir RAMs\n(CAB-RAMs), as very few participants in the BCPP had ever been exposed\nto an INSTI-containing regimen and it is unlikely that there were any\nmajor CAB-RAMs in the study population. The lack of analysis for HIV\nminority variants could be a limitation of our study as we could have\nunderreported the prevalence of the RPV-RAMs. Lastly, in the BCPP study,\nART exposure was only confirmed verbally by participants, which may have\nresulted in an overestimation of ART-naive individuals (who had not\ndeclared their ART history). ^52^\n\n### Conclusions\n\nOur study provides the first data for archived RPV-RAMs in ART-naive and\nART-suppressed individuals in Botswana. We identified a moderate\nprevalence of RPV-RAMs that was similar to other regions and other HIV\nsubtypes: 10.7% in ART-naive and 13.7% in ART-suppressed PWH in\nBotswana. Most RPV-RAMs were the result of an E138A mutation. Since\nindividuals with the E138A mutation may be more likely to fail\ncabotegravir/rilpivirine, monitoring of this mutation will be crucial\nfor effective cabotegravir/rilpivirine implementation in this setting.\n\n\n## Funding\n\nS.M., S.G., W.T.C. and N.O.M. are partly supported through the\nSub-Saharan African Network for TB/HIV Research Excellence (SANTHE 2.0)\nfrom the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (INV- 033558).

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals. This retrospective study examines genetic sequences and clinical parameters like CD4+ T cell counts and viral load to understand the epidemiological and genetic characteristics of HIV-1 in the pediatric population in Rio de Janeiro.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 36146776\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: Monitoring HIV-1 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs) is important for disease surveillance. Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

We performed ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) of protease, RT, integrase and gp105 regions. Only mutations in the HIV-2 ANRS list >1% were considered. HIV-2 tropism was assessed by V3 loop region UDS, and each read was interpreted with determinants of CXCR4-coreceptor use.\nResults\nAmong the 47 patients assessed, three displayed plasma viruses with a resistance-associated mutation (RAM) above the 20% detection threshold, all in RT, resulting in a prevalence of transmitted drug resistance for NRTI of 7.9% (95% CI 0.0%--16.5%). No RAM above the 20% detection threshold was found in protease or integrase. At the 1% detection threshold the transmitted drug resistance prevalence was 9.8% (95% CI 0.6%--19.0%), 13.2% (95% CI 3.5%--22.9%) and 4.5% (95% CI 0%--17.5%) for PI, NRTI and integrase inhibitors. The most prevalent MRV was the PI RAM I50V detected in three samples.

This\ncomprehensive study aims to examine the alterations in HIV-1 subtypes or\nsub-subtypes and TDR among Chinese individuals, who have been diagnosed\nwith HIV infection and are previously untreated with antiretroviral\ntherapy (ART), across the span of 2004 to 2022.\n\n### Methods\n\nSequences of the HIV-1 *pol* gene region were obtained from ART-naïve\nHIV-positive individuals across 31 provincial-level administrative\ndivisions between 2004 and 2022. To predict susceptibility to 12\nantiretroviral drugs, the research utilized the Stanford HIV Drug\nResistance Database. The Cochran-Armitage trend test facilitated the\nanalysis of changes in HIV-1 subtype/sub-subtype prevalence and TDR.\nThis analysis was conducted in alignment with the progression of the\nNational Free Antiretroviral Treatment Program's stages between 2004 and\n2022.\n\n### Results\n\nAmong the 57,902 ART-naïve individuals infected with HIV, there was a\nnotable decline in the prevalence of CRF01_AE, B, and C from 37.3%,\n24.1%, and 1.3% respectively in 2004--2007 to 29.4%, 7.3%, and 0.2%\nrespectively in 2020--2022. Simultaneously, a significant increase was\nobserved in the proportions of CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, CRF55_01B, other\nCRFs, and URFs, from 24.1%, 11.5%, 0.1%, 0.4%, and 0.9% respectively in\n2004--2007 to 40.8%, 11.5%, 3.8%, 3.7%, and 2.8% respectively in\n2020--2022 (all *P* \\<0.001 for trend). The prevalence of TDR to\noverall, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI),\nefavirenz, and nevirapine also significantly increased from 2.6%, 1.8%,\n1.6%, and 1.8% respectively in 2004--2007 to 7.8%, 6.7%, 6.3%, and 6.7%\nrespectively in 2020--2022 (all *P* \\<0.001 for trend). However, there\nwere no meaningful changes in the TDR prevalence of nucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitor and protease inhibitor. Notably, in 2020--2022,\nthe overall TDR prevalence exceeded 15% in Xinjiang.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThe total prevalence of TDR in China has achieved a moderate level\n(7.8%) from 2020 to 2022, with NNRTI resistance standing prominently at\n6.7%. Consequently, measures to curb TDR are urgently required,\nparticularly among ART-naïve HIV-infected individuals in China.\n\n\n\n## METHODS\n\nA total of 67,739 sequences were extracted from the HIV-1 *pol* gene\nregion (HXB2 ( 6 ) positions 2,253--3,312) of ART naïve HIV-infected\nindividuals between the period of 2004 and 2022. These sequences were\nprocured from both the National Center for AIDS/STD Control and\nPrevention, China CDC and the HIV sequence databases of the Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory ( https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/ , retrieved December 30,\n2022).\n\nData verification steps were undertaken; the records from China CDC were\nscrutinized to ensure participants were indeed ART-naïve and\nHIV-infected. Furthermore, GenBank annotations and corresponding\npublished articles were scrutinized to isolate those fulfilling the set\ncriteria: the documentation of an ART-naïve HIV-1-infected population;\nthe sampling year; and the recruitment site.\n\nThe reference sequence for the study was HXB2. HIV-Trace was utilized\nfor sequence alignment, while the HIV-1 subtypes/sub-subtypes were\ndetermined via the construction of phylogenetic trees using the\nmaximum-likelihood method of IQ-Tree v 2.0.6 ( 7 ).\n\nIndividuals were included in the study based on the following criteria:\nage of 18 years and above, availability of the sampling year and\nprovincial-level administrative division (PLAD), protease and at least\nthe initial 238 amino acids of the reverse transcriptase (HXB2 positions\n2,280--3,263) were available, and, if multiple sequences were available\nfor a person, the earliest one was chosen.\n\nA total of 57,902 HIV-1 *pol* gene region sequences that covered 31\nPLADs made up the final dataset ( Supplementary Figure S1 , available in\nhttps://weekly.chinacdc.cn/ ). This study received approval from the\nEthics Committee of the National Center for AIDS/STD Control and\nPrevention, China CDC (approval number X140617334).\n\nThe Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (HIVdb) was leveraged to\nextrapolate susceptibility to 12 antiretroviral drugs, using the World\nHealth Organization (WHO)'s 2014 HIVDR guidelines as a reference ( 8 ).\nViruses interpreted as possessing low, intermediate, or high-level\nresistance were classified as resistant with a penalty score equal to or\ngreater than 15 ( 9 ). The assessment of drug resistance was\naccomplished using Stanford University's HIVDR Database's online\nsequence analysis tool ( https://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-sequences/\n).\n\nStatistical evaluations were conducted using SAS (version 9.4, SAS\nInstitute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The collected data from 2004 to 2022 was\nstratified into five distinct sampling periods that aligned with the\nNFATP developmental stages in China. The Chi-square test was utilized to\nscrutinize the sociodemographic characteristics relative to these five\nsampling periods. For evaluating trends in subtypes, sub-subtypes, and\nTDR prevalence within these periods, the Cochran-Armitage trend test was\nemployed. A two-tailed *P* -value less than 0.05 established statistical\nsignificance.\n\n### RESULTS\n\nThe study population consisted of 57,902 ART-naïve HIV-infected\nindividuals, which were categorized according to the development stages\nof the NFATP. The distribution of the subjects over the years was as\nfollows: 1,251 (2.2%) were enrolled between 2004 and 2007, 8,794 (15.2%)\nbetween 2008 and 2011, 21,467 (37.1%) between 2012 and 2015, 21,391\n(36.9%) between 2016 and 2019, and 4,999 (8.6%) between 2020 and 2022 (\nTable 1 ). A Pearson's Chi-squared test revealed significant variations\nin sociodemographic variables across these five periods ( *P* \\<0.001).\n\nThe data indicated significant decreases in the proportions of ART-naïve\nHIV-infected individuals over time for circulating recombinant form\n(CRF)01_AE, B, and C. Specifically, they fell from 37.3%, 24.1%, and\n1.3% in 2004--2007 to 29.4%, 7.3%, and 0.2% in 2020--2022, respectively\n(all *P* \\<0.001 for trend) ( Table 2 ). For ART-naïve HIV-infected\nindividuals, the proportions of CRF01_AE within cluster 1, cluster 2,\ncluster 3, cluster 6, cluster 7, and CRF01_AE-other also significantly\ndecreased from 13.3%, 2.5%, 1.0%, 0.5%, 0.5%, and 6.4% in 2004--2007 to\n4.2%, 2.2%, 0.7%, 0.1%, 0.0%, and 2.0% in 2020--2022, respectively (all\n*P* \\<0.001 for trend). In contrast, the proportions of ART-naïve\nHIV-infected individuals for CRF01_AE-cluster 4, CRF07_BC, CRF07_BC-MSM,\nCRF07_BC-other, CRF08_BC, CRF55_01B, other CRFs, and unique recombinant\nforms (URFs) showed a significant increase from 8.1%, 24.1%, 5.4%,\n18.6%, 11.5%, 0.1%, 0.4%, and 0.9% in 2004--2007 to 13.6%, 40.8%, 24.3%,\n16.4%, 11.5%, 3.8%, 3.7%, and 2.8% in 2020--2022, respectively (all *P*\n\\<0.001 for trend). However, there were no significant changes observed\nover time in the proportions of CRF01_AE-cluster 5 and other subtypes.\n\nThe reported prevalence of TDR progressively increased from 2004--2007\nto 2020--2022 ( Table 3 ). A significant prevalence of 23.4% was\nrecorded in Xinjiang within the 2020--2022 timeframe. The prevalence of\nTDR, both overall and in connection with the non-nucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), increased gradually from 2004--2007 to\n2020--2022. Over the same series of intervals, the TDR prevalence for\nefavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP) escalated from 2004--2007 to\n2020--2022 ( Supplementary Figure S2 , available in\nhttps://weekly.chinacdc.cn/ ).\n\nWe observed an almost threefold increase in the prevalence of TDR during\n2020--2022 (7.8% and 6.7%) in comparison to the period from 2004--2007\n(2.6% and 1.8%), for both overall and NNRTI rates ( *P* \\<0.001 for\ntrend). Notably, the prevalence of transmitted NNRTI resistance specific\nto EFV and NVP marked a significant increase from 1.6% and 1.8% in\n2004--2007 to 6.3% and 6.7% in 2020--2022, respectively ( *P* \\<0.001\nfor trend). Yet, the prevalence of TDR associated with nucleoside\nreverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and protease inhibitor (PI)\ndemonstrated no significant variation over time. The overall TDR\nprevalence findings remained consistent with the trends of missing and\nnon-missing values for each sociodemographic factor ( Supplementary\nTable S1 , available in https://weekly.chinacdc.cn/ ). The\nCochran-Armitage trend test results revealed an increasing trend over\ntime in NNRTI resistance mutations for A98, E138, G190, K101, K103,\nK238, P225, V106 and V179, as well as in NRTI resistance mutations for\nL74 and M184 (all *P* \\<0.05 for trend). Conversely, there were no\nsignificant developments discernible over time in the PI resistance\nmutations ( Supplementary Table S2 , available in\nhttps://weekly.chinacdc.cn/ ).\n\n### CONCLUSIONS\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study represents the largest survey\nconducted thus far regarding the national distribution and trends of\nHIV-1 subtypes/sub-subtypes and TDR. With a sample size of 57,902, it\nspans from 2004 to 2022, encompassing the entire period during which\ndependable estimates were available for ART-naïve HIV-infected\nindividuals in China.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2015, an increasing trend was noted in CRF01_AE, while\nsubtypes B and C displayed a decreasing trend. These findings align with\nthe results of a systematic review of Chinese HIV-1 subtypes from 1990\nto 2015 ( 10 ). The review indicated that CRF01_AE raised from 27.2% to\n47.2% between 2005--2009 and 2010--2015, whereas subtypes B and C\ndecreased from 38.7% and 1.7% to 17.8% and 1.6% in the same periods,\nrespectively.\n\nThe 2006 Chinese National Molecular Epidemiologic Survey reported that\nthe primary HIV-1 subtypes were largely recombinant, including CRF01_AE,\nCRF07_BC and CRF08_BC which made up to 80% of the cases, whereas subtype\nB and remaining subtypes constituted nearly 20%. A retrospective review\nof HIV/AIDS prevention and control over 30 years in China revealed the\nprevalence of injection drug use-linked HIV epidemic until 2008,\nincreasing incidence in heterosexuals, and the complexity of HIV-1\nsubtypes as the proportion of CRFs surpassed other subtypes ( 11 ).\n\nOur study corroborates the findings of the 2006 Chinese National\nMolecular Epidemiologic Survey that CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC\nincreasingly predominated in China from 2004 to 2008 ( 12 ). The data\nreveal increases in CRF01_AE-cluster 4, CRF07_BC-MSM, CRF07_BC-Other,\nCRF08_BC, CRF55_01B, Other CRFs, and URFs. In contrast, CRF01_AE-cluster\n5 and other subtypes remained consistent, whereas instances of CRF01_AE,\ncluster 1, cluster 2, cluster 3, cluster 6, and cluster 7, and subtypes\nB and C showed a deduction.\n\nThese shifting patterns have contributed significantly to the complexity\nand diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and CRFs. A noteworthy observation was\nthe varied distributions of HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant forms and\nalterations among ART-naïve HIV-infected individuals in different years.\nThe genetic diversity of HIV-1 subtypes/sub-subtypes is driven by a\nmultitude of causes, including potential biological differences between\nsubtypes/sub-subtypes that may impact transmission and disease\nprogression. However, other contributing NVP factors could include\naspects like transportation connectivity, migration, urbanization, and\npopulation growth.\n\nIncomplete treatment or unequal prevention coverage, and disparities in\neffectiveness across different geographical regions or risk groups can\npotentially skew control of the HIV epidemic. Such disparities might\ncontribute to varying regional distributions of HIV-1 subtypes and\nrecombinant forms, with particular regions or risk groups more affected\nby certain HIV variants.\n\nThe 2017 WHO HIV Drug Resistance Guidelines defined the prevalence of\ntransmitted HIVDR as low (\\<5%), moderate (5%--15%), and high (\\>15%) (\n13 ). This study witnessed a significant increase in overall TDR\nprevalence, even climbing to moderate levels between the years 2020 and\n2022. However, in the Xinjiang region, it exceeded 15%, indicating a\nhigh level. A comprehensive analysis of HIV-1 TDR in China from 2001 to\n2017 indicated an upward trend in overall TDR prevalence, consistent\nwith this study's findings ( 14 ). A review of HIV-1 TDR studies\nspanning 2009 to 2019 ( 15 ) showed that the overall TDR prevalence in\nSub-Saharan Africa and North America significantly expanded from 3.6%\nand 12.1% respectively, in 2009--2013, to 6.0% and 14.2%, respectively,\nin 2014--2019, as per the WHO 2009 surveillance drug resistance\ndefinitions ( 16 ). There were, however, no observable changes in the\noverall TDR prevalence in South/Southeast Asia, Latin America/Caribbean,\nEurope, and Upper-Income Asian Countries in the same periods ( 15 ). A\ncomprehensive U.S. study from 2004 to 2016 displayed considerable\nincrease in overall TDR prevalence from 9.8% to 17.9% ( 17 ).\nConversely, another large U.S. study from 2014 to 2018 found no\nstatistically significant changes in overall TDR prevalence, which stood\nat 18.9% ( 18 ). In our study, overall TDR prevalence was 3.2%, 4.4%,\nand 4.5% for 2008--2011, 2012--2015, and 2016--2019, respectively. These\nfindings are similar to those from a South/Southeast Asia study ( 16 ),\nwhere the majority of data originated from China. Given the size of this\ndataset, the study is representative and likely to credibly mirror TDR\nrates among ART-naïve, HIV-infected individuals in China from 2004 to\n2022. Of significant concern is the sharp increase in overall TDR\nprevalence to 7.8% in the years 2020--2022 --- a moderate level --- with\nXinjiang seeing overall TDR prevalence reach 23.4%, a high level. As TDR\nbecomes a critical issue in China, the country must prioritize\nresistance monitoring, and reevaluate first-line antiviral treatment\nregimens at a regional level.\n\nIn this investigation, a marked upward trend in the prevalence of TDR\nspecifically regarding NNRTI was identified, reaching moderate levels\nfrom 2020--2022. Yet, no significant changes were detected in the TDR\nprevalence for NRTI and PI. This is aligned with a comprehensive review\nof HIV-1 TDR in China from 2001 to 2017, underlining NNRTI resistance as\nthe primary driver ( 14 ). A large-scale study in the United States from\n2014 to 2018 found the prevalence of TDR for NNRTI, NRTI, and PI to be\n12.0% (5,662/47,215), 6.9% (3,258/47,215), and 4.2% (1,983/47,215),\nrespectively ( 18 ). These findings, particularly the elevated\nprevalence of transmitted NNRTI resistance (12.0%), correspond with\nthose of the present study.\n\nEFV and NVP-based ART regimens were most commonly initiated in countries\nthat reported data to the WHO between 2014 and 2020 ( 8 ). In China,\nXinjiang exhibited an overall TDR prevalence exceeding 10%, primarily\ndue to NNRTI resistance. This suggests countries displaying a prevalence\nof transmitted HIVDR to NNRTI equal to or above 10% should urgently\nconsider non-NNRTI first-line ART regimens ( 13 ).\n\nFrom 2020--2022, moderate TDR levels were observed in the application of\nEFV and NVP regimens, which are the primary drug regimens recommended by\nChina's NFATP. The detection of EFV and NVP-specific HIVDR is of\nparamount importance due to these drugs' widespread use. Notably,\nresistance mutations for NNRTI, specifically K103, E138, and V179, have\nseen an increase from 0.4%, 0.1%, and 0.3% in 2004--2007 to 3.4%, 0.8%,\nand 1.7% in 2020--2022, respectively; while resistance mutations for\nNRTI, particularly M184, have risen from 0.2% in 2004--2007 to 0.7% in\n2020--2022.\n\nCRFs represent the foremost subtype of HIV-1 in China, meriting further\nexploration of their specific mutations or polymorphisms in relation to\ndrug resistance, using phenotypic drug resistance methods ( 19 ). Such\nsurveillance is crucial for future TDR planning in the context of HIV\ninfection. Finally, it is noteworthy to mention that in late 2019,\npublic health services shifted their focus toward the coronavirus\ndisease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic ( 20 ), necessitating further\ninvestigation of any potential links between COVID-19 and HIV drug\nresistance.\n\nThis study presents several limitations. The sociodemographic indicators\nutilized in the research revealed certain data gaps. The comparison\ncreated between non-absent and absent values for each sociodemographic\nvariable showed no significant shift in the overall TDR prevalence as\ndemonstrated in Supplementary Table S1 . Second, we failed to gather\npertinent clinical information such as the stage of HIV, the time of HIV\ndiagnosis, and the number of sexual partners. In future studies,\nincorporating this data could augment the accuracy of the results and\nfurther enable analysis of variant effects. Finally, potential sampling\nbias entailed by regional variation necessitates attention; future\nendeavors will incorporate a thorough evaluation of shifts in the\nspatio-temporal distribution of drug resistance amongst ART-naïve\nHIV-positive patients.\n\nOur research findings suggest that the overall prevalence of TDR among\nART-naïve individuals infected with HIV in China during 2020--2022\nreached a moderate level, with Xinjiang exhibiting a high level.\nIndividuals with HIV who present with drug resistance carry these\nresistant strains for life, consequently lowering the efficacy of\nantiretroviral drugs, thereby increasing new HIV infections and\nassociated morbidity and mortality rates. As a result, these individuals\nshould be given precedence for prevention strategies and optimal\ntreatment. It is imperative to carry out field investigations to\ndetermine the reasons for TDR among ART-naïve individuals infected with\nHIV; this would enable the development of targeted interventions to\nreduce the occurrence and transmission of HIV drug-resistant strains.\nRegular monitoring and surveillance of drug resistance at national and\nprovincial levels among ART-naïve individuals infected with HIV, along\nwith escalating efforts to prevent TDR development, are vital to\nachieving the global objective of eradicating AIDS as a public health\nthreat by 2030.\n\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nSupported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (grant\nnumbers 2022YFC2305205, 2022YFC2305201); the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China (grant number 82260670); Guangxi Bagui Honor\nScholarship; and Chinese State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease\nPrevention and Control\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 37112921\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Transmitted HIV Drug Resistance in Bulgaria Occurs in Clusters of Individuals from Different Transmission Groups and Various Subtypes (2012--2020)\nAbstract\nTransmitted HIV drug resistance in Bulgaria was first reported in 2015 using data from 1988--2011. We determined the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity in Bulgaria during 2012--2020 using polymerase sequences from 1053 of 2010 (52.4%) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. Sequences were analyzed for DRM using the WHO HIV SDRM list implemented in the calculated population resistance tool at Stanford University. Genetic diversity was inferred using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetics. Cluster detection and characterization was performed using MicrobeTrace. The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%). Most (34/60, 56.7%) of the SDRMs were present in transmission clusters of different subtypes composed mostly of male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC), including a 14-member cluster of subtype B sequences from 12 MMSC and two males reporting heterosexual contact; 13 had the L90M PI mutation and one had the T215S NRTI SDRM. We found a low SDRM prevalence amid high HIV-1 diversity among ART-naive patients in Bulgaria during 2012--2020. The majority of SDRMs were found in transmission clusters containing MMSC, indicative of onward spread of SDRM in drug-naive individuals. Our study provides valuable information on the transmission dynamics of HIV drug resistance in the context of high genetic diversity in Bulgaria, for the development of enhanced prevention strategies to end the epidemic.\n\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity using sequences from ART-naive individuals.

Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences.

Hence, this study was aimed to evaluate HIV-1 disease progression\nand drug resistance mutation among children on first-line antiretroviral\ntherapy in Ethiopia. **Method:** A longitudinal study was conducted\namong 551 HIV-positive children (\\<15 years old) recruited between 2017\nand 2019 at 40 antiretroviral treatment delivery sites in Ethiopia.\nDisease progression was retrospectively measured over a 12-year\n(2007--2019) follow-up as the progress towards immunosuppression. Two\nconsecutive viral load (VL) tests were conducted in 6-month intervals to\nassess virologic failure (VF). For children with VF, HIV-1 genotyping\nand sequencing was performed for the *pol* gene region using in-house\nassay validated at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention, and the Stanford HIVDB v9.0 algorithm was used for\nidentification of drug resistance mutations. The Kaplan--Meier analysis\nand Cox proportional hazards regression model were used to estimate the\nrate and predictors of disease progression, respectively. **Results:**\nThe disease progression rate was 6.3 per 100 person-years-observation\n(95% CI = 4.21--8.53). Overall immunosuppression (CD4 count \\< 200\ncells/mm ^3^ ) during the 12-year follow-up was 11.3% (95% CI =\n7.5--15.1). Immunosuppression was significantly increased as of the mean\nduration of 10.5 (95% CI = 10.1--10.8) years (38.2%) to 67.8% at 12\nyears ( *p* \\< 0.001). Overall, 14.5% had resistance to at least one\ndrug, and 6.2% had multi-drug resistance. A resistance of 67.8% was\nobserved among children with VF. Resistance to non-nucleotide reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and nucleotide reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors (NRTI) drugs were 11.4% and 10.1%, respectively. Mutations\nresponsible for NRTI resistance were M184V (30.1%), K65R (12.1%), and\nD67N (5.6%). Moreover, NNRTI-associated mutations were K103N (14.8%),\nY181C (11.8%), and G190A (7.7%). Children who had a history of\nopportunistic infection \\[AHR (95% CI) = 3.4 (1.8--6.2)\\], vitamin D \\<\n20 ng/mL \\[AHR (95% CI) = 4.5 (2.1--9.9)\\], drug resistance \\[AHR (95%\nCI) = 2.2 (1.4--3.6)\\], and VF \\[AHR (95% CI) = 2.82 (1.21, 3.53)\\] had\na higher hazard of disease progression; whereas, being orphan \\[AOR (95%\nCI) = 1.8 (1.2--3.1)\\], history of drug substitution \\[(AOR (95% CI) =\n4.8 (2.1--6.5), hemoglobin \\< 12 mg/dL \\[AOR (95% CI) = 1.2 (1.1--2.1)\\]\nhad higher odds of developing drug resistance. **Conclusions:**\nImmunosuppression was increasing over time and drug resistance was also\nsubstantially high. Enhancing routine monitoring of viral load and HIVDR\nand providing a vitamin-D supplement during clinical management could\nhelp improve the immunologic outcome. Limiting HAART substitution is\nalso crucial for children taking HAART in Ethiopia.\n\n\n## 2. Methods\n\n### 2.1. Study Setting\n\nThe Ethiopian government began a limited program of making HAART\navailable on a fee basis in 2003, and in early 2005, began to make ART\navailable on a free basis nationwide, with support from the Global Fund\nto Fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria \\[ 19 \\]. As of June 2020, a\ntotal of 464,762 PLHIV were taking HAART \\[ 5 , 9 \\]. According to the\nlatest revised guideline \\[ 4 \\], there were four allowable first-line\nART regimens added for selective use in situations where NRTI-based\nregimens cannot be used or cause adverse effects or intolerance: d4T +\n3TC + NVP, d4T + 3TC + EFV, ZDV + 3TC + EFV, and ZDV + 3TC + NVP. In the\nevent of failure of the first-line regimen, the allowable second-line\nregimens are: (ddI or TDF) + ABC + (LPV/r or SQV/r or NFV or IND/r \\[ 4\n\\].\n\n### 2.2. Study Design\n\nA longitudinal study was conducted from 2017 to 2019 among HIV-infected\nchildren (\\<15 years old) on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). It\nwas part of a national cohort study on HIV-1 treatment failure and\nacquired drug resistance among people taking ART at 63 health facilities\nin the country \\[ 19 \\].\n\n### 2.3. Study Population and Sampling\n\nHIV-infected children taking first-line ART for at least six months were\nincluded in the study. Out of the 63 health facilities and 13,649\npatients in the initial study, 40 had pediatric ART service and all the\nchildren from these health facilities ( *n* = 554) were included. The\ndisease progression of HIV-infected children was retrospectively\nretrieved for 12 years (2007--2019) and measured as a change in\nimmunosuppression (i.e., CD4 count). CD4 count \\<200 cells/mm ^3^ was\nused to define immunosuppression \\[ 20 \\]. Moreover, viral load (VL)\ntesting was conducted for children twice at 6-month intervals between\nMarch and September 2019 to determine virologic failure (VF). Then,\nchildren with VF (i.e., viral load ≥ 1000 copies/mL) were included for\nHIV drug resistance investigation, given those with VL \\< 1000 copies/mL\nwere considered as susceptible and excluded from HIVDR testing \\[ 20 \\]\n( Figure 1 ).\n\nFigure 1\n\nEligibility, sampling, and sample size determination for disease\nprogression and HIV drug resistance among children taking HAART in\nEthiopia (2007--2019).\n\n### 2.4. Data Collection\n\nData were collected using interview, medical record review, and\nlaboratory testing. Mothers/female guardians of the children were\ninterviewed during the routine follow-up visit to collect data on\nsociodemographic and individual factors. Patient records were also\nabstracted to capture data on clinical and laboratory results such as\nhemoglobin, CD4 count, and history of ART regimen. Then, children with\ninitial viral load ≥1000 copies/mL at baseline testing were further\nfollowed for six months for a second round of VL re-testing. Enhanced\nadherence and counseling were introduced as interventions during the\nsix-month follow up.\n\n### 2.5. Laboratory Testing\n\nWhole blood was collected from children using two\nethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) coated test tubes of 3--5 mL\neach, and plasma was extracted using centrifugation at 2000 revolutions\nper minute (RPM). The second-round blood samples were collected after a\n6-month follow-up from children with an initial viral load \\>1000\ncopies/mL.\n\nHIV-1 viral load tests at baseline and after 6-month follow-up were\nperformed at selected regional laboratories in the country using two\ntechniques (i.e., COBAS ^®^ AmpliPrep/CobasTaqman ^®^ and Abbott Real\nTime HIV-1). CD4 T-cell count and hemoglobin tests were conducted from\nwhole blood at the study facilities using a Facscount ^®^ automated cell\ncounter (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and CELDYN ^®^\nhematology analyzer, respectively. Moreover, inflammatory biomarker\n(hsCRP) and vitamin-D tests were performed at the national Clinical\nChemistry laboratory using an Elecsys 2010 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer\n(Roche, Basel, Switzerland).\n\nIn-house assay validated by the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention\nand Control (CCDC) was used for amplification and sequencing of the\n*pol* gene of HIV-1 using an ABI-3730 DNA genetic analyzer \\[ 3 \\]. The\n*pol* gene region of the HIV-1 gene was sequenced by an ABI-3730 DNA\ngenetic analyzer \\[ 21 , 22 \\]. The sequence was edited using a\nweb-based ReCall ( http://pssm.cfenet.ubc.ca/ , accessed on 11 April\n2023).\n\n### 2.6. Variables\n\nWe had two outcome (dependent) variables; disease progression (i.e., CD4\ncount) and drug resistance. Independent variables were demographic\ncharacteristics (age, gender, education, and region); individual factors\n(previous ART exposure, missed appointments, and HIV status disclosure);\nand clinical characteristics (functional status, hemoglobin, clinical\nstage, and ART regimen history).\n\n### 2.7. Definition\n\n**Immunosuppression** : CD4 count of \\<200 cells/mm ^3^ after 6 months\nof HAART initiation \\[ 23 \\].\n\n**Disease progression rate** : Overtime change in immunosuppression (CD4\ncount \\< 200 cells/mm ^3^ ) of children \\[ 10 \\].\n\n**Virologic Failure** : Children with two consecutive plasma viral loads\n≥ 1000 copies/mL within 6 months of follow-up with adherence and\ncounseling \\[ 23 \\].\n\n**Drug resistance:** characterized according to the Stanford database\n(HIVDB). Since HIVDR testing was conducted for children with VL ≥ 1000\ncopies/mL, children with VL \\< 1000 copies were considered to be\nsusceptible and included in the overall HIVDR analysis \\[ 23 \\].\n\n**Vitamin-D deficiency** : A plasma vitamin-D level of below 20 ng/dL \\[\n10 , 18 \\].\n\n**Inflammation** : A plasma hsCRP value of \\>3 mg/dL \\[ 10 , 18 \\].\n\n**Functional status** : 'ambulatory' if a patient was bedridden for \\<15\ndays of the month prior to recruitment to the study and 'bedridden' if\nthe patient was bedridden for ≥15 days of the month prior to the study,\nas reported by the physician at the ART site \\[ 24 \\].\n\n### 2.8. Statistical Analysis\n\nData were summarized using median and mean for continuous and frequency\nand percentage for the categorical variables. The Kaplan--Meier curve\nwas carried out to illustrate the rate of the disease progression among\nchildren, which was calculated as the rate of children with a CD4 count\n\\<200 cells/mm ^3^ on a yearly basis, and the Cox proportional hazards\nregression model was used to determine the predictors of disease\nprogression. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals\nwere used to report effect sizes at a statistical significance level of\n*p* \\< 0.05.\n\nDrug resistance was calculated using the HIVDB algorithm (v9.0) at\nStanford's HIV genotypic resistance profile (\nhttps://hivdb.stanford.edu/ , accessed on 11 April 2023). The logistic\nregression model was used to identify factors contributing to drug\nresistance. Variables with *p* \\< 0.2 in crude analysis were included in\nthe multivariable model and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% CIs were\nused to report effect sizes at a significance level of *p* \\< 0.05. All\ndata analysis was conducted using STATA version 16.0.\n\n\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics\n\nThe mean age of children was 9.33 (SD ± 2.21) years old. More than half\nof the study participants were aged below 10 years (58.3%), while the\nmajority were urban dwellers (89.7%). Of all children on HAART, nearly\nhalf (46.8%) were from three regional states, Oromia (18.1%), Amhara\n(16.7%), and Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR)\n(12%) ( Supplemental Table S1 ).\n\nA majority of the children (80%) were taking one of the three HAARTs\nregimens, which were Zidovudine (AZT) + Lamivudine(3TC) +Nevirapine\n(NVP) (35.9%), Stavudine(D4T) + Lamivudine(3TC) + Nevirapine (NVP)\n(30.3%), and Zidovudine (AZT) + Lamivudine(3TC) + Efavirenz (EFV)\n(14.0%) ( Table 1 ; Supplemental Table S1 ). About half (47.5%) of the\nchildren had at least a one-time HAART substitution history. Overall,\n63% of the substitutions were from those who were taking Abacavir\n(ABC) + Lamivudine(3TC) + Nevirapine (NVP) followed by Abacavir (ABC) +\nLamivudine(3TC) + Efavirenz (EFV) (21.2%), and Tenofovir (TDF) +\nLamivudine(3TC) + Nevirapine (NVP) (16.0%). Moreover, more than half of\n56% of the substitutions were replaced by Stavudine(D4T) +\nLamivudine(3TC) + Efavirenz (EFV) followed by Stavudine(D4T) +\nLamivudine(3TC) + Nevirapine (NVP) (31.31%) and Zidovudine (AZT) +\nLamivudine(3TC) + Nevirapine (NVP) (12%). At baseline of the study,\n37.8% of the children had a viral load \\>1000 copies/mL, which was\nreduced to 21.4% after 6 months of follow-up, when adherence and\ncounseling interventions were provided. More than half (61.3%) of the\nchildren had inflammation (hsCRP \\> 3.0 mg/L) and 51.5% had vitamin-D\ndeficiency (Vitamin D \\< 20 mg/L) ( Table 1 ).\n\n### 3.2. Disease Progression\n\nOverall immunosuppression among children taking HAART in Ethiopia was\n11.25% (95% CI = 7.5--15.1). Among male children, immunosuppression was\n12.95% compared to 9.52% among female. Immunosuppression was also higher\nin the age group 6--10 years (12.24%) compared to ≤5 years (6.58%).\nChildren with a history of opportunistic infections (OIs) had a 22.64%\nlevel of immunosuppression compared to 8.54% among those who had no OIs.\nOf those children who were not virally suppressed, 26.27% had\nimmunosuppression. Children with hsCRP \\>3 mg/L and those with vitamin D\n\\<20 ng/mL had a higher rate of immunosuppression, which accounted for\n338 (13.31%) and 284 (18.66%), respectively. A quarter of the children\nwith a duration on HAART for more than 133 months had immunosuppression\n( Supplemental Table S2 ).\n\nThe disease progression rate among children taking HAART was 6.3 per 100\nperson-years (95% CI = 4.2--8.1). Immunosuppression at the mean duration\nof 10.5 years was 38.2%, which significantly increased to 67.8% at the\n12th year ( *p* \\< 0.01) ( Figure 2 A,B). Vitamin D at 9 years of\nfollow-up was significantly lower compared to \\<7 years, *p* = 0.02. The\nrate of inflammation also showed an increment over time ( Figure 2 C).\n\nFigure 2\n\nDisease progression (the rate of drop in CD4 count below 200/µL) among\nchildren taking HAART in Ethiopia (2007--2019): ( **A** ) Kaplan--Maier\nanalysis for evaluation of disease progression ( **B** ) CD4 count\ndistribution over HAART duration (The red dotted lines represent the\nmean CD4 count and the green dots represent distribution of CD4 count) (\n**C** ) Cumulative hazard on disease progression, vitamin-D deficiency,\nand hsCRP (\\>3 mg/dL).\n\n### 3.3. HIV-1 Drug Resistance\n\nHIVDR among children taking HAART in Ethiopia was 14.52% (95% CI =\n10.21--12.76), and 6.2% had multi-drug resistance (resistance for more\nthan one drug) mutation. HIV-1 drug resistance was 67.8% among children\nwith a viral load \\>1000 copies/mL. It was relatively higher among\nchildren \\>10 years old (17.39%). Moreover, those who live in a rural\narea had 17.54% prevalence of HIVDR compared to the 14.17% among urban\ndwellers. HIVDR among ambulatory children was 20.0%, while this was\n9.97% among bedridden children. About half (48%) of the children taking\nd4t + 3TC + EFV developed at least one type of drug resistance followed\nby d4t + 3TC + NVP (16.8%) and AZT + 3TC + NVP (13.6%). About half\n(50.84%) of the children on HAART for more than 100 months had at least\none type of drug resistance mutation. At the regional level, higher\nrates of at least one drug resistance were found among children in the\nAfar (27.78%), Tigray (25.64%), and Gambella (19.35%) regions (\nSupplemental Table S2 ).\n\nThe rate of resistance to NNRTI and NRTI was 11.4% and 10.1%,\nrespectively ( Figure 3 ). The only protease inhibitor (PI) associated\nwith high-level resistance was observed for NFV 1 (0.9%).\n\nFigure 3\n\nCharacteristics of HIVDR mutations among children taking HAART in\nEthiopia (2007--2019): ( **A** ) NRTI associated mutations ( **B** )\nNNRTI associated mutations.\n\nHigh-level resistances were observed for NRTI drugs including 3TC\n(60.9%), FTC (60.9%), and DDI (43.6%). Resistance levels for ABC, DOR,\nTDF, and d4T were 34%, 21.8%, 22.7%, and 21.8%, respectively. NNRTIs\nassociated with high levels of drug resistance were NVP (40.0%), EFZ\n(39.1%), RPV (30.0%), and ETR (12.7%) ( Table 2 ).\n\nMutations responsible for NRTI resistance were M184V, K65R, D67N, K70R,\nand Y115F that accounted for 30.1%, 12.1%, 5.6%, 5.6%, and 5.0%,\nrespectively. The common mutations associated with NNRTI resistance were\nK103N (14.8%), Y181C (11.8%), G190A (7.7%), and V106M (5%) ( Figure 3 ).\n\n### 3.4. Predictors of HIV-1 Disease Progression and Drug Resistance\n\nAt HAART initiation, virologic failure (VL \\> 1000 copies/mL),\nimmunosuppression (CD4 count \\< 200 cells/mm ^3^ ), inflammation (hsCRP\n\\> 3 mg/dL), and vitamin-D deficiency (\\<20 ng/dL) were 10%, 9%, 52%,\nand 42%, and at 12 years of HAART experience, all significantly\nincreased to 47%, 38%, 78%, and 70%, respectively ( Figure 4 ).\n\nFigure 4\n\nTrends of virologic failure (VL \\< 1000 copies/mL), immunosuppression\n(CD4 count \\< 200 cells/mm ^3^ ), inflammation (hsCRP \\> 3 mg/dL), and\nvitamin-D deficiency (\\<20 ng/dL) among children taking HAART in\nEthiopia (2007--2019).\n\nChildren who had history of OI \\[AHR (95% CI = 3.38 (1.84, 6.23)\\], had\nHIVDR \\[AHR (95% CI) = 2.2 (1.4--3.6)\\], those with VF \\[AHR (95% CI) =\n2.82 (1.21, 3.53)\\], and vitamin D \\< 20 ng/mL \\[AHR (95% CI) = 4.5\n(2.1, 9.9)\\] were associated with an increased hazard of disease\nprogression compared to their respective counterparts ( Table 3 ).\n\nAfter adjusted analysis, being orphan \\[AOR (95% CI) = 1.81\n(1.2--3.1)\\], history of drug substitution \\[AOR (95% CI) = 4.8\n(2.1--6.5)\\], and hemoglobin \\<12 mg/dL \\[AOR (95% CI) = 1.24\n(1.1--2.0)\\] had higher odds of developing drug resistance compared to\ntheir counterparts ( Table 4 ).\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nIn the current study, the rate of disease progression was 6.3 per 100\nperson-years, and the prevalence of HIV drug resistance was 14.5% (11.4%\nfor NNRTI and 10.1% for NRTI) among children on first-line\nantiretroviral therapy in Ethiopia. Immunosuppression at the mean\nduration of 10.5 years was 38.2%, which nearly doubled (67.8%) at 12\nyears ( *p* \\< 0.001). Children who had a history of opportunistic\ninfection, vitamin D \\<20 ng/mL, and drug resistance were significantly\nassociated with a higher hazard of disease progression while being\norphaned; drug substitution and hemoglobin \\<12 mg/dL were independent\ndeterminants of drug resistance.\n\nThe 6.3 per 100 person-years rate of disease progression among children\nin the current study was consistent with previous reports \\[ 8 , 10 \\].\nMoreover, the experience in children of poor immune recovery at an\nadvanced stage of HAART was also supported by previous studies \\[ 4 , 5\n, 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 \\]. There was a gradual improvement in the CD4 cell\ncount after HAART initiation, which could be indicative of effective\nHAART response. However, children who were on HAART for more than 10\nyears showed a rapid disease progression. This was consistent with a\nfinding in India \\[ 15 \\] and a similar study among adults in South\nAfrica \\[ 16 \\]. This high rate of disease progression after years of\nexposure to HAART could be explained by a high rate of virologic\nfailure, HAART-associated vitamin-D deficiency, and decreased medication\nadherence at an advanced stage of the HAART experience \\[ 11 , 12 , 13 ,\n14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 \\]. This\nfinding can also be explained by the fact that a long-time exposure to\nHAART could lead to drug resistance as a result of selective pressure,\nwhich increases viral replication and impacts disease progression \\[ 14\n\\].\n\nThe higher rate of disease progression observed in children with a\nhistory of opportunistic infections was consistent with previous\nfindings from South Africa \\[ 19 \\] and Kenya \\[ 20 \\]. This is because\nOIs might result from a following decrease in CD4 cell counts \\[ 21 , 22\n\\]. Children with an unsuppressed viral load had a higher hazard of\ndisease progression. Unsuppressed viral load was the result of poor\nmedication adherence or treatment failure as a result of HIVDR. In this\nanalysis, adherence was one of the interventions after the first viral\nload. Hence, unsuppressed viral load is most likely the result of drug\nresistance, since our analysis also showed drug resistance was a\nsignificant predictor of disease progression. On the other hand,\nvitamin-D deficiency was a significant predictor of disease progression.\nThis can be explained in many ways. Deficiency may lead to disease\nprogression, or malnutrition following disease progression can\nreciprocally result in vitamin-D deficiency. Longer exposure to HAART\ncould also lead to hypovitaminosis \\[ 24 , 25 \\]. This is also supported\nby the current findings in Cameroon \\[ 26 \\] and another studies \\[ 27 ,\n28 , 29 , 30 \\], which showed a higher decline in vitamin D among\nchildren with a low CD4 count and advanced HAART experience. This\nimplies the importance of providing vitamin-D supplement for those with\nadvanced HAART experience and low CD4 count.\n\nThe 14.5% prevalence of drug resistance mutation among children on HAART\nin our study was more than double compared to the 6.7% prevalence of\nresistance among adults in Ethiopia \\[ 31 \\]. This could be explained by\nthe higher rates of medication nonadherence and drug substitution among\nchildren. The high prevalence of K103 with NNRTI-associated mutation\ncontradicts with previous reports that showed V106M is the favored NNRTI\nresistance mutation in HIV-1 infected adults \\[ 32 \\]. This could\nindicate the importance of a population-specific treatment regimen. On\nthe other hand, M184V mutation was also the most common mutation\nassociated with NRTIs. This was consistent with other previous studies\nconducted in Zimbabwe and Uganda \\[ 12 , 33 \\]. As expected, there were\nfew significant protease inhibitor mutations because of the infrequent\nuse of protease inhibitor containing regimens among the study\npopulation. Data from patients in Botswana reported that T215Y occurs in\ncombination with D67N and K70R, rather than with M41L and L210W \\[ 34\n\\]. Similarly, we identified the presence of M41L in addition to T215Y\n(with or without L210W). Moreover, K65R is thought to commonly emerge in\nHIV-1 subtype C \\[ 35 \\], which was consistent with our current study.\n\nOur analysis reveals that orphans were almost twice more likely to\ndevelop drug resistance, which could result from poor medication\nadherence, or they might acquire it from their parents who died due to\ndrug resistance. Moreover, drug resistance was higher in children with a\nhistory of drug substitution and whose hemoglobin level was \\<12 mg/dL.\nThis relationship can be bidirectional. Drug substitution during the\nclinical management of patients might lead to drug resistance \\[ 36 \\].\nThe association between low hemoglobin and drug resistance can be due to\nadvanced disease progression in children with drug resistance \\[ 34 , 37\n\\].\n\nThis study might have certain limitations. One drawback is that we only\nstudied children who were alive and on treatment, but there might be a\nsignificant number lost to follow-up and dead children as a result of\npoor immunologic outcome. Hence, this study could underestimate disease\nprogression and drug resistance.\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions\n\nImmunosuppression was increasing over time and drug resistance was also\nsubstantially high. This requires that the national HIV program\nintegrate HIVDR testing as part of the individual treatment,\nparticularly for children. Moreover, enhancing routine monitoring of\nviral load and HIVDR, and providing a vitamin-D supplement during the\nclinical management, could help improve the immunological outcome.\nLimiting HAART substitution is also crucial for children taking HAART in\nEthiopia.\n\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThis research received no external funding.\n\n\n## Data Availability Statement\n\nSince data analysis for other objectives is ongoing, the raw data can be\nobtained from the first corresponding author.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 26196688\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Factors Associated with the Development of Drug Resistance Mutations in HIV-1 Infected Children Failing Protease Inhibitor-Based Antiretroviral Therapy in South Africa\nMethods\nData from children initiated on protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy with subsequent virological failure referred for genotypic drug resistance testing between 2008 and 2012 were retrospectively analysed. Frequencies of drug resistance mutations were determined and associations with these mutations identified through logistic regression analysis.\nResults\nThe study included 65 young children (median age 16.8 months [IQR 7.8; 23.3]) with mostly advanced clinical disease (88.5% WHO stage 3 or 4 disease), severe malnutrition (median weight-for-age Z-score -2.4 [IQR -3.7;-1.5]; median height-for-age Z-score -3.1 [IQR -4.3;-2.4]), high baseline HIV viral load (median 6.04 log ~10~ , IQR 5.34;6.47) and frequent tuberculosis co-infection (66%) at antiretroviral therapy initiation. Major protease inhibitor mutations were found in 49% of children and associated with low weight-for-age and height-for-age (p = 0.039; p = 0.05); longer duration of protease inhibitor regimens and virological failure (p = 0.001; p = 0.005); unsuppressed HIV viral load at 12 months of antiretroviral therapy (p = 0.001); tuberculosis treatment at antiretroviral therapy initiation (p = 0.048) and use of ritonavir as single protease inhibitor (p = 0.038). On multivariate analysis, cumulative months on protease inhibitor regimens and use of ritonavir as single protease inhibitor remained significant (p = 0.008; p = 0.033).\nRationale: The paper focuses on genotypic drug resistance testing and the identification of drug resistance mutations in patient samples. It does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility assays or data.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 36016383\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be transmitted via parenteral, sexual, or vertical exposure routes. The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals. This retrospective study examines genetic sequences and clinical parameters like CD4+ T cell counts and viral load to understand the epidemiological and genetic characteristics of HIV-1 in the pediatric population in Rio de Janeiro.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 20029816\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: To examine the efficacy of these drugs in Cameroon, where diverse non-B HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant viruses predominate, the reverse transcriptase (RT) viral sequences in patient plasma were analyzed for the presence of mutations that confer drug resistance. Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon.\nRationale: The paper doest not mention in vitro drug susceptibility data or phenotypic data.

Genotyping was done on dried blood spot and/or plasma of participants with high HIV VL (≥1000 copies/mL). HIV genes (reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase) were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. The Stanford HIVDR Database was used for HIVDR interpretation.\nResults\nHIVDR genotyping was performed on blood samples from 137 participants (92 children and 45 adults) with VL ≥ 1000 copies/mL. The overall prevalence of HIV DRMs was 75.1%, with DRMs present in 78.4% of children and 57.8% of adults. Importantly, 5.8% of participants had INSTI DRMs including major DRMs: Q148K, E138K, G118R, G140A, T66A and R263K. NNRTI, NRTI and PI DRMs were also detected in 62.8%, 44.5% and 8% of participants, respectively. All the participants with major INSTI DRMs harboured DRMs targeting NRTI backbone drugs.\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing. It focuses on genotyping and identifying drug resistance mutations from patient samples.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 20345882\nQuestion ID: 1\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\nEvidence: HIV-1 drug resistance mutations in children after failure of first-line nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy. One hundred and twenty children were included in the study. Their median age (interquartile range) was 9.1 (6.8–11.0) years, the median duration of their NNRTI regimens was 23.7 (15.7–32.6) months, their median CD4 percentage was 12% (4–20%), and their median plasma HIV RNA at the time of genotype testing was 4.8 (4.3–5.2) log10 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL. The nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance mutations found were as follows. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence, predictors and patterns of genotypic resistance mutations in children after failure of World Health Organization-recommended initial nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based treatment regimens.\nRationale: The paper discusses genotypic resistance testing performed on HIV-infected children who experienced failure of NNRTI-based therapy. This indicates that HIV sequences from patient samples were analyzed to determine resistance mutations.\nAnswer: Yes"}

We\nstudied acquired HIVDR (ADR) patterns and describe potentially active\ndrugs after first- and second-line failure in resource-limited settings\n(RLS) like Cameroon. A laboratory-based study with 759 patients (≥15\nyears) experiencing virological failure was carried out at the Chantal\nBiya International Reference Centre (CIRCB), Yaoundé, Cameroon.\nSocio-demographic, therapeutic and immunovirological data from patient\nrecords were analysed according to HIV-1 genotypic profiles. Median\n(IQR) ART-duration was 63 (50--308) months. Median CD4 and viremia were\n153 (IQR:50--308) cells/mm ^3^ and 138,666 (IQR:28,979--533,066)\ncopies/mL, respectively. Overall ADR was high (93.4% first-line;\n92.9%-second-line). TDF, potentially active in 35.7% of participants\nafter first-line and 45.1% after second-line, suggested sub-optimal\nTLD-efficacy in second-line (64.3%) and third-line (54.9%). All PI/r\npreserved high efficacy after first-line failure while only DRV/r\npreserved high-level efficacy (87.9%) after second-line failure. In this\nresource-limited setting (RLS), ADR is high in ART-failing patients.\nPI/r strategies remain potent backbones for second-line ART, while only\nDRV/r remains very potent despite second-line failure. Though TLD use\nwould be preferable, blind use for second- and third-line regimens may\nbe sub-optimal (functional monotherapy with dolutegravir) with high risk\nof further failure, thus suggesting strategies for selective ART switch\nto TLD in failing patients in RLS.\n\n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1. Study Design and Target Population\n\nWe carried out a laboratory-based cross-sectional and analytical study\nfrom November 2011 to August 2019 with adults (≥15 years) who had failed\nfirst- and second-line ART, received for genotypic resistance testing\n(GRT) at the Chantal Biya International Reference Centre (CIRCB) for\nResearch on HIV and AIDS Prevention and Management, Yaoundé, Cameroon.\n\n### 2.2. Study Site Description\n\nOur study was carried out at CIRCB, Yaoundé, Cameroon and included\npatients presenting for resistance testing from all ten regions of the\ncountry. Located in the capital city, Yaoundé, and created in 2006 with\nmuch expertise in the field of HIV/AIDS research, CIRCB offers GRT for\nPLWHIV at a subsidized cost.\n\n### 2.3. Sample Size Calculation and Sampling Method\n\nUsing an estimated prevalence for HIVDR of 94%, as described by Kouamou\net al. \\[ 18 \\], and a 5% error margin at 95% confidence interval (CI)\nand taking into account our eight-year period, we obtained a minimal\nsample size of 696 participants. Participants were recruited following\nconsecutive and exhaustive sampling.\n\n### 2.4. Selection Criteria\n\nInclusion criteria: We included all participants aged ≥ 15 years,\nfailing virologically (two consecutive plasma viral loads ≥ 1000\ncopies/mL after intensified adherence counselling) on a standard first-\nor second-line ART regimen after being treated for at least six months.\nOf note, adherence was measured using a self-reported method evaluated\nby the responsible clinician during clinical appointment. All\nparticipants had performed genotypic resistance testing at CIRCB.\n\nExclusion criteria: We did not include patients who were naïve to ART or\nre-initiating ART (population suitable for pre-treatment HIVDR\nsurveillance), those with undocumented ART therapies, on TB treatment\n(due to risk of drug interaction) or those with incomplete sequences.\n\n### 2.5. Enrolment Procedure\n\nParticipants were selected following our eligibility criteria from a\npool of patients in the CIRCB antiviral resistance (CARe) database.\nTheir socio-demographic, clinical and immunovirological data, sequences\nand GRT results were obtained.\n\n### 2.6. Procedure for GRT\n\nEnrolled patients had previously benefited from GRT following an\nin-house protocol as follows:\n\nFirst, 10 mL of blood was drawn from treatment-failing patients who\npresented for GRT at CIRCB. Plasma samples were then separated from\nwhole blood and stored between −20 °C to −80 °C when samples were not to\nbe analysed immediately. Viral RNA was extracted using a commercially\navailable protocol after an initial two-hour centrifugation of 1 mL of\nplasma at 14,000 rpm to improve viral RNA concentration and thus\nincrease PCR sensitivity. Following this step, 140 µL of plasma was\nretained for HIV-1 RNA extraction following the QIAGEN protocol (QIAamp\n^®^ DNA Minikit; QIAGEN, Courtaboeuf, France). Using an in-house\nprotocol and two-step polymerase chain reaction-PCR (RT-PCR and\nNested-PCR), HIV-1 pol-gene (protease and reverse-transcriptase regions)\nwas then amplified (\\~1600 base pairs). Using agarose gel\nelectrophoresis, the effectiveness and integrity of PCR products was\nconfirmed, following which the amplicons were purified. Purified\nproducts were submitted to a sequencing reaction. Products of the\nsequencing reaction were then gel-purified using SEPHADEX (Seperation\nPharmacia Dextran; Cytiva Sweden AB, SE-751 84 Uppsala, Sweden) gel to\nremove excess reactants and render DNA products pure. Sequencing was\nperformed using an Applied Biosystems 3500 genetic analyzer (HITACHI,\nTokyo, Japan) and sequence assembly and editing with SeqScape v2.7\n(Applied Biosystems) or Recall v2.28 \\[ 19 \\]. The Stanford University\ndatabase (Stanford HIVdb) was used to identify drug resistance mutations\n(DRMs).\n\n### 2.7. Sequence Interpretation and Analysis\n\nAll edited sequences were interpreted using Stanford HIVdb v.9.4. to\nidentify major DRMs and potentially active medications. Rapid subtyping\ntools, such as COMET ( https://comet.lih.lu/ , accessed on 21 June 2020)\nand REGA (\nhttp://dbpartners.stanford.edu:8080/RegaSubtyping/stanford-hiv/typingtool/\n, accessed on 21 June 2020), were used for subtyping, with confirmations\nperformed using molecular phylogeny after sequence alignment with\nBioEdit v.7.2.5 and tree inference with MEGA software v.70.107.\nSequences generated for the purpose of this study were submitted to\nGenbank under the following accession numbers: MK580543-MK580618 ;\nJF273935-JF273965 ; JQ796152-JQ796169 , MK867721-MK867755 ; and\nOQ985493-OQ985958 .\n\n### 2.8. Data Interpretation and Statistical Analysis\n\nData was entered and analysed using Epi Info version 7.2.2.6.\nQuantitative variables were described using mean (standard deviation)\nand median (interquartile range). Qualitative variables were described\nwith frequencies and proportions stating 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nAssociations between qualitative variables were calculated using chi\nsquare and Fischer's exact tests where appropriate. Student's T test was\nused to compare means of continuous variables between groups, and *p*\n-values \\< 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Any *p* \\<\n0.2 from bivariate analysis was included for multivariate analysis\nthrough logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders such\nage, sex, region or HIV-1 subtypes.\n\n### 2.9. Ethical Considerations\n\nEthical clearance was sought and obtained from the Institutional Review\nBoard of the Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of\nYaoundé I (reference number 330/UYI/FMSB/VDRC/DAASR/CSD). Research\nauthorisation was also obtained from the CIRCB directorate to carry out\nour study in this establishment. Confidentiality was ensured by using\npatient identification numbers with password-protected computers, and\ncore ethical values were respected.\n\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. Socio-Demographic and Clinical Data\n\nWe retained a total of 759 participants with mean age (±SD) of 42 (±14)\nyears. Majority of participants were female: 485/745 (63.9%). All 10\nregions of the country were represented, with participants from the\ncentre: *n* = 436 (57.4%); northwest: *n* = 86 (11.3%); and littoral:\n*n* = 85/745 (11.2%) regions. Of the 759 participants, 575 (75.8%) were\nfailing non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based\nfirst-line ART, while 184 (24.2%) were failing protease inhibitor\n(PI/r)-based second-line (NB: The second-line failing patients had\npreviously failed first-line regimens as recommended by national\ntreatment guidelines). Table 1 shows a more detailed therapeutic history\nof the participants.\n\n\n### 3.2. Immuno-Virological Characteristics\n\nOverall, median (IQR) CD4 cell count at the time of failure was low; 153\n(50--308) cells/µL. With respect to the therapeutic lines, immunological\nstatus was similar between first- and second-line treated patients\n(median CD4: 161 (56--315) cells/µL for first-line and 126 (39--299)\ncells/µL for second-line, *p* = 0.18).\n\nAs to virological status, the overall median viral load (IQR) (global)\nwas high at 138,666 (28,979--533,066) copies/mL. Similarly to\nimmunological status, there was no significant difference in the median\nviral load (IQR) between first- and second-line patients at 134,645\n(29,461--555,654) copies/mL and 142,710 (28,331--507,564) copies/mL,\nrespectively ( *p* = 0.81; Table 1 ).\n\n### 3.3. Acquired Drug Resistance Patterns\n\nGlobally, overall drug resistance rate (presence of at least one major\nDRM) was high at 708/759 (93.3% CI; 91.3--94.9%). Prevalence of drug\nresistance by antiretroviral class were as follows:\nnucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance:\n651/759 (85.8%); NNRTI resistance: 685/759 (90.3%); and protease\ninhibitor (PI/r) resistance: 105/759 (13.8%). Dual-class resistance was\nas follows: NRTI_NNRTI: 83.3% (632/759); NRTI_PI/r resistance: 13.4%\n(102/657); and NNRTI_PI/r resistance: 12.4% (94/759). Triple class\nresistance was 12.4% (94/459). Overall, the most prevalent mutation was\nM184V (75.5%), followed by K103N (47.4%) and Y181C (27.7%). See Figure 1\na,b.\n\nFigure 1\n\nMutational profiles for ( **a** ) NRTI, ( **b** ) NNRTI and ( **c** )\nPI/r resistance.\n\nAfter first-line failure, overall HIVDR (presence of at least one major\nDRM) was 93.4% (CI 91.1--95.2%) and varied by drug class as follows:\nNRTI resistance: 87.7%; NNRTI resistance: 92.2%; PI/r resistance: 5%.\nNRTI_NNRTI dual class resistance: 86.7%. After second-line failure,\noverall-HIVDR was 92.9%, (95% CI 88.1--96.1%) with 80.0% resistance to\nNRTI, 41.8% resistance to PI/r, and 40.1% NRTI_PI/r dual-class\nresistance. The most prevalent PI/r resistance mutation was M46I\n(29.8%), followed by I54V (14.9%) and I84V (12.8%). See Figure 1 c.\n\nThe bar charts to the left of Figure 1 a--c show the prevalences of\nmajor mutations by drug classes: the yellow, blue and red bars describe\nmutation prevalence irrespective of treatment regimen (overall), after\nfirst-line failure, and after second-line failure, respectively. The dot\nplots to the right of the figure show the frequencies of each mutation.\nThe yellow, blue and red dots represent frequencies irrespective of\ntreatment regimen (overall), after first-line failure, and after\nsecond-line failure, respectively.\n\n### 3.4. Genetic Diversity\n\nWe observed a total of 36 clades. The major viral clade was CRF02_AG,\nmaking up 60.3%, (56.8--63.8%) of the viral subtypes, followed by A ~1~\n(6.1%; 5.6--8.0%) then G (5.7%; 4.2--7.5%). Pure subtypes made up 24.2%\nof the viral subclades, while recombinant subtypes made up 75.8%. We did\nnot find any association between HIV-1 viral clade and CD4, viral load\nor HIVDR occurrence ( Table 2 ). Thus, rate of resistance, viral load\nand CD4 count are not dependent on the clade/subtype of HIV-1; rather\nthey are linked to the clinical status and the therapeutic regimens\nused.\n\n\n### 3.5. Potentially Active Drugs\n\n#### 3.5.1. Potential Efficacy of Commonly Used Antiretroviral Drugs after First- and Second-Line Failure\n\nWe considered effective drugs as those having a susceptibility score of\n\\<30 according to the Stanford HIVDR database. After first-line failure,\nirrespective of NRTI exposure, zidovudine (AZT) was potentially active\nin 46.1% (95% CI: 42.1--50.2%) of participants; tenofovir (TDF) in 35.7%\n(95% CI: 31.9--39.7%); abacavir (ABC) in 18.5% (95% CI: 15.6--21.9%);\nand lamivudine/emtricitabine (3TC/FTC) in 8.7% (95% CI: 10.5--21.5%). As\nto NNRTI, efavirenz (EFV) was potentially active in 13.2% of\nparticipants (95% CI; 10.7--16.2%) and nevirapine (NVP) in 7.6%, (95%\nCI; 5.7--10.1%) of participants ( Figure 2 ).\n\nFigure 2\n\nPotential efficacy of commonly used antiretroviral drugs with respect to\ntherapeutic lines. The figure shows the percentage of participants ( *y*\naxis) in whom the listed antiretroviral drugs ( *x* axis) appeared\neffective after first-line ( **left** ) and second-line ( **right** )\nfailure. Note the high levels of effective DRV/r even after second-line\nfailure. AZT: zidovudine; TDF: tenofovir; 3TC: lamivudine; ABC:\nabacavir; EFV: efavirenz; NVP: nevirapine; ATV/r: atazanavir; LPV/r:\nlopinavir; DRV/r: darunavir.\n\nAfter second-line failure, AZT appeared potentially active in 35.2% (95%\nCI: 28.3--42.6%) of participants; tenofovir (TDF) in 45.1% (95% CI:\n37.7--52.6%); ABC in 22.5% (95% CI: 16.7--29.3%); and 3TC/FTC in 15.4%\n(95% CI: 10.5--21.5%). Darunavir (DRV/r) appeared potentially active in\n86.7% (84.8--94.8%) of participants, unlike atazanavir (ATV/r) and\nlopinavir (LPV/r) which appeared potentially active in 61.0% (95% CI\n63.5--68.1%). See Figure 2 .\n\n#### 3.5.2. Efficacy of NRTI Molecules with Respect to NRTI Exposure\n\nAfter AZT/D4T + XTC exposure in first-line treatment, few participants\nhad virus susceptible to AZT (30.7%), TDF (41.0%) and ABC (21.0%). On\nthe contrary, after TDF + XTC exposure, 63.1% of participants had viral\nsusceptibility to AZT, 30.9% to TDF and 18.4% to ABC (See Figure 3 ).\nNote that mutation K65R, typically present at TDF (and often ABC)\nfailure, increases susceptibility to AZT, thus making the latter a\nrelevant option in patients failing TDF/ABC.\n\nFigure 3\n\nEfficacy of nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors\n(NRTIs) after ( **a** ) first- and ( **b** ) second-line failures. This\nfigure shows the percentage of participants with preserved efficacy (\n*y* axis) of locally available NRTIs (zidovudine (AZT), abacavir (ABC)\nand tenofovir (TDF); *x* axis), with respect to NRTI exposure in both\nfirst- and second-line failing patients. Note the poor levels of\nefficacy of ABC and TDF after sole exposure to AZT in both first- and\nsecond-line regimens are explained by cross-resistance due to thymidine\nanalogue mutations.\n\n#### 3.5.3. Efficacy of ATV/r, LPV/r and DRV/r with Respect to PI/r Exposure\n\nDRV/r preserved good levels of efficacy despite PI/r history. After\nATV/r and LPV/r exposure, DRV/r preserved efficacy in 96.6% and 81.0% of\nparticipants, respectively. After both ATV/r and LPV/r exposure, it\npreserved efficacy in 87.8% (75.2--95.4%) of participants, particularly\nif used at 600 mg bid. Lastly, after previous exposure to other PIs (NFV\nand IDV), it preserved efficacy in 60.0% of individuals ( Figure 4 ).\n\nFigure 4\n\nEfficacy of protease inhibitors (PI/r) with respect to PI/r exposure.\nThe figure demonstrates the percentage of participants with preserved\nefficacy ( *y* axis) of PI/r ( *x* axis) after PI/r exposure. 'Others'\nrefers to older protease inhibitors such as nelfinavir and indinavir. We\nnote that irrespective of the initial PI/r used, viral susceptibility to\nDRV/r was observed in a good number of second-line failing participants.\nATV/r: atazanavir; LPV/r: lopinavir; DRV/r: darunavir.\n\n#### 3.5.4. Predictive Efficacy of TLD\n\nTaking into consideration the potential efficacy of TDF after first- and\nsecond-line failure (35.7% and 45.1% respectively), and considering the\nnon-exposure to integrase strand transfer inhibitors (and thus the\npotential efficacy of dolutegravir), full TLD efficacy was predicted in\n35.7% and 45.1% of patients after first- and second-line failures,\nrespectively. With respect to drug exposure, predictive efficacy of TLD\nappeared lowest in patients with prior exposure to TDF-only regimens,\nfollowed by those exposed to both AZT/D4T and TDF, and highest in those\nexposed to AZT-only regimens (30.9%, 36.3% and 41.0%, respectively).\nLastly, after second-line failure, TLD predictive efficacy appears\nhighest in those who had received only AZT/D4T-containing regimens\n(50.0%), followed by those who had received TDF-only regimens (47.0%)\nand those who had received both TDF and AZT/D4T (35.1%).\n\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nThe scalability of ART comes with expected increases in HIVDR in a\nresource-limited setting (RLS). Our study aimed at describing the\npatterns of HIVDR in patients failing ART in Cameroon between 2011 and\n2019. Overall rates of ADR were high in these patients, with 93.3%\npresenting with at least one major DRM. These results are not surprising\nas HIVDR constitutes the major reason for patients failing ART in\nCameroon. The development of these resistances in the clinical context\ncould be favoured by poor adherence to ART, stock ruptures,\nsub-therapeutic blood levels of drug (probably due to poor absorption,\ndrug-drug interactions or food-drug interactions), poor prescription\npractices and intrinsic viral factors, amongst others \\[ 20 , 21 \\]. In\naddition, the long duration of treatment (median duration \\~5 years)\nindicates heavily treated patients with the increased possibility of\naccumulating DRMs over time. Elsewhere, the poor immunovirological\nstatus in this population at the time of genotypic resistance testing\n(median, CD4 count 153 cells/mm ^3^ and median viral load, 138,666\ncopies/mL) suggests late detection of failure, which could also explain\nthe high levels of ADR observed. Moreover, the high viral load (5log)\nand low CD4 count observed after first- and second-line failure in our\ncontext is different from values obtained in western countries (moderate\nlevel viremia that is in the order of 3log) but more like in patients\nwith advanced failure and higher risk of clinical progression and death\n\\[ 22 , 23 \\]. Taking U=U (undetectable=untransmissible) into\nconsideration, the high viral loads and high rates of resistance at\nfailure in these patients increase the risk of HIV transmission, with an\nincreased risk of transmitting drug resistances \\[ 24 , 25 , 26 \\].\nThere is therefore a need for better and more effective treatment in\nthese patients, given that the risks of transmission, clinical\nprogression and death are higher. This further advocates treatment\nguided by resistance testing because we cannot afford another failure \\[\n27 \\]. In this RLS, where resistance tests may not be available for all\npatients, the question of genotyping for treatment initiation should not\nbe a major concern. As a matter of fact, in an era where NNRTI-based\ntherapies (weak genetic barriers) are being phased out and replaced by\nDTG-based regimens, baseline drug resistance to DTG is very low (overall\nintegrase resistance: 0.8%; integrase resistance in ART-naïve: 0.0%;\nintegrase resistance in ART-experienced: 0.9%) \\[ 28 \\]. With this low\nrate of DTG resistance across an ART-naïve population, GRT might not be\nessential for treatment initiation. This is particularly true because\nresistance to TDF and 3TC are also very low at ART initiation. In\naddition, DTG-based regimens overcome the natural resistance of some HIV\nclades (such as HIV-1 group O, group N and HIV-2). Nevertheless, we\nrecommend continuous surveillance of resistance at population level and\nthe use of resistance testing in heavily treated, treatment-failing\npatients due to the possible accumulation of drug resistance mutations\n\\[ 29 \\]. HIV-1 genetic variability was high in this population, with a\ntotal of 36 identified viral clades led principally by recombinant\nsubtypes (75.8%), notably CRF02_AG (60.3%). Although this high genetic\nvariability reiterates the rich biodiversity of HIV in Cameroon,\nharbouring all HIV-subtypes, it also underscores the difficulties that\nmay accompany the management of this disease in our context and probably\ncontribute to the high levels of resistance observed.\n\nIn patients failing first-line therapy, rates of ADR were high (93.4%),\nwith similar trends across the drug classes with 97.7% for NRTI, 92.2%\nfor NNRTI and 86.7% for NRTI_NNRTI dual-class resistance. These results\nare similar to those obtained in Taiwan by Tsai et al. in 2017 and\nManasa et al. in South Africa \\[ 30 , 31 \\]. This supports the argument\nthat HIVDR is the main factor responsible for treatment failure in our\ncontext. As for PI/r resistance, rates after first-line failure were,\nnot surprisingly, low (5%), supported by the absence of PI/r drug\npressure in first-line treated patients. The PI/r resistance in\nfirst-line patients would thus be driven mostly by the presence of\ntransmitted drug resistances, which is low in the PI/r class, as\ndescribed in Mexico by Gerardo et al. in 2018 who found the prevalence\nof PI/r transmitted drug resistance to be 4.9% \\[ 32 \\]. After\nsecond-line failure, rates of NRTI and NNRTI resistance all remained\nhigh (92.9% and 84.1% respectively). PI/r resistance was higher (41.8%)\nthan in first-line failure, as in previous studies. Nevertheless, this\nresult suggests the possibility of recycling PI/r for further\ntherapeutic options even after second-line failure in about half of\nfailing patients \\[ 33 \\], also considering the relatively limited\ncross-resistance of darunavir (particularly if used at 600 mg bid) after\nthe development of resistance to other PIs.\n\nAs concerns potentially active regimes after first-line failure, AZT\npreserved efficacy in 46% of patients, TDF in 35.7% and ABC in 18.5%. In\nthis era of transition to TLD, this highlights the risk of sub-optimal\ntherapy in about 65% of patients, given the poor efficacy of TDF (DTG\nfunctional monotherapy). Though many studies have shown good efficacy of\nTLD despite NRTI resistance, clinical monitoring of this group of\npatients is crucial in order to evaluate the long-term efficacy of such\nregimens and also permit opportune detection of failure \\[ 16 , 17 \\].\nThis also advocates the better and greater use of viral load for the\nearly detection of virological failure in first- and second-line\nregimens, given that the accumulation of mutations occurs heavily in\npatients where the virus replicates in the presence of non-effective\ndrugs and drug concentrations; early detection of failure spares the\naccumulation of mutations and increases the chance of efficacy of the\nnext regime. In addition, in this context of high viral load and low CD4\ncount at failure, the risk of failure with functional DTG monotherapy is\neven higher. As concerns NNRTIs, EFV and NVP preserved activity in a\nvery limited proportion of patients (13.2% and 7.6%, respectively).\nThese results are similar to other studies carried out in Africa and can\nbe explained by the fact that these first-generation NRTIs have low\ngenetic barriers with greater propensity for accumulating drug\nresistance mutations \\[ 34 , 35 \\]. This indicates a very limited need\nfor these drugs in future therapeutic options after treatment failure \\[\n36 \\]. Not surprisingly, all commonly used protease inhibitors in our\ncontext (ATV/r, LPV/r and DRV/r) preserved high levels of efficacy after\nfirst-line failure (94.6%, 94.8% and 96.6%, respectively) \\[ 36 \\].\nThese results highlight the fact that in resource-limited settings like\nours, PIs may constitute a driving arm for second-line therapy in\nfirst-line failing patients. With respect to NRTI exposure, AZT\npreserved efficacy in most patients (63.1%) after first line failure\nwith documented exposure to TDF-only regimens. On the contrary, after\nexposure to AZT/D4T, both TDF and ABC preserved efficacy in a limited\nnumber of participants. This is explained by the fact that patients\nexposed to thymidine analogues (AZT/D4T) may develop thymidine analogue\nmutations (TAMs), which have variable degrees of cross-resistance to\nother molecules of the same class (ABC and TDF). As such, ABC and TDF\nmay be sub-optimal in most patients having received AZT/D4T-containing\nregimens, while AZT remains effective in patients failing TDF- or\nABC-only regimens due to the absence of cross-resistance with AZT,\nunless transmitted. Therefore, in patients with a clearly documented\ntreatment history of TDF-only regimens and no previous treatment with\nAZT/D4T, blind switches to second-line therapy could be made with a PI/r\nassociated with 3TC and AZT, even in the absence of genotypic resistance\ntesting, with great chance of success \\[ 27 \\].\n\nAfter second-line failure, all commonly used NRTIs in our context (TDF,\nAZT and ABC) appeared to be effective only in a low proportion of\nparticipants (45.1%, 37.7% and 22.5%, respectively). This indicates that\ncare needs to be taken in choosing subsequent NRTI-accompanying drugs\nfollowing second-line failure with the need for genotypic resistance\ntesting. This also highlights the fact that blind transitions to TLD in\npatients failing second-line therapy in our context may be sub-optimal\nin about half of patients. Interestingly, DRV/r remained effective in\nthe majority of patients (96.6%), even after second-line failure and\ndespite the risks of cross-resistance by mutations to ATV/r and LPV/r.\nTherefore, DRV/r remains recyclable in third-line regimens in our\ncontext \\[ 37 \\].\n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions\n\nIn this resource-limited setting, using WHO guidelines for ART\nmanagement and laboratory-based HIVDR surveillance, rates of ADR are\nvery high after first- and second-line failures, favoured by long\ntreatment duration and late failure detection. After an NNRTI-based\nfirst-line, PI/r and a substituted NRTI-accompanying molecule may be\nsufficient in second-line treatment, especially with a well-documented\ntreatment history, but may need GRT guidance in cases of the first-line\nuse of thymidine analogues. After second-line failure, DRV/r remains\nvery effective, thus representing a great option for third-line\nregimens. Lastly, TLD may be sub-optimal (functional monotherapy with\nDTG) when used blindly as a second- or third-line regimen. This calls\nfor cautious monitoring and use by designing a sequential algorithm for\nswitching heavily treated failing patients to TLD, especially those with\nprevious exposure to TDF-containing regimens. These measures will ensure\nthe long-term efficacy of TLD in resource-limited settings.\n\n\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThis research was funded by the Chantal BIYA International Reference\nCenter for Research on HIV and AIDS Prevention and Management (CIRCB),\nunder the annual budget plan 2021.\n\n\n## Data Availability Statement\n\nNot applicable.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 20029816\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: To examine the efficacy of these drugs in Cameroon, where diverse non-B HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant viruses predominate, the reverse transcriptase (RT) viral sequences in patient plasma were analyzed for the presence of mutations that confer drug resistance. Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon.\nRationale: The paper doest not mention in vitro drug susceptibility data or phenotypic data. It mentions clinical isolates and sequencing of plasma samples.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 37317505\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Objectives:  Bictegravir/tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (BIC/TAF/FTC) is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV with a high barrier to resistance and few reported cases of treatment failure. We present three cases of treatment-emergent resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in patients with suboptimal treatment adherence and assess whether the resistance-associated mutations were present before BIC/TAF/FTC initiation or emerged during therapy.\nMethods: We used genotypic drug resistance testing by Sanger sequencing to identify emergent resistance mutations in plasma viral load specimens collected after combination antiretroviral therapy initiation in all participants. Additionally, we performed ultra-deep sequencing by Illumina MiSeq on the earliest available plasma HIV-1 viral load specimen and on any available specimens closest in time to the initiation of BIC/TAF/FTC therapy to identify low-abundance resistance mutations present in the viral quasispecies.\nResults: All three participants developed NRTI resistance after prolonged exposure and incomplete adherence to BIC/TAF/FTC. The T69N, K70E, M184I, and/or T215I mutations identified in clinical samples at the time of virological failure were not present on deep sequencing of either baseline samples or samples collected before BIC/TAF/FTC initiation.\nRationale: The paper does not report in vitro drug susceptibility data. Instead, it focuses on clinical cases of treatment-emergent resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in HIV patients treated with bictegravir/tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (BIC/TAF/FTC). The methods involve genotypic drug resistance testing using Sanger sequencing and ultra-deep sequencing to identify resistance mutations in clinical samples collected after therapy initiation.

Standard first-line regimen in Iran is comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI);  drug resistance mutations for the 3 classes of ART (NNRTI, NRTI, and PI) were observed and 4 samples showed resistance to all of them.\nRationale: The paper mentions the patients got standard treatment, and the evidence indicates the presence of mutations associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, suggesting that individuals in the study had received these drug classes prior to sample sequencing.\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI\n\nPMID: 36578581\nQuestion ID: 12\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\nEvidence: \"In 8 (4.6%) of the 174 patients with INSTI resistance, DTG was the only INSTI used in the treatment regimen.

Four of 5 patients with DTG resistance had poor therapeutic adherence (as assessed by their physicians when the sample was sent for resistance testing) and in the fifth, the treatment regimen had been changed after renal failure.\"\nRationale: The paper discusses the presence of drug resistance mutations in patients with treatment, indicating that sequences were obtained from such individuals.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 36016383\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be transmitted via parenteral, sexual, or vertical exposure routes. The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals.

The term\nvirological suppression includes both low but detectable HIV viremia and\nundetectable HIV viremia, and the latter is possibly associated with a\nlower immune activation state. Herein, we describe a 24-month follow-up\nof experienced PLWH with plasma HIV RNA undetectable or detectable \\< 50\ncopies/ml switching to BIC/FTC/TAF. A previous 12-month monitoring was\navailable, and the factors correlated with treatment efficacy. This\nretrospective multicenter study included PLWH who switched to\nBIC/FTC/TAF in the period of 2019--2022, and who were HBsAg and HCV RNA\nnegative. The follow-up study times were 6 (T6), 12 (T12), 18 (T18), and\n24 (T24) months after the switch (T0). Survival analysis with\nmultiple-failure-per-subject design, Kaplan--Meier survival estimates,\nmultivariate analysis of variance, multilevel linear regression, and a\nhierarchical ordered logistic model were applied. A total of 329 PLWH\nhad plasma HIV RNA which was either undetectable or detectable at \\<50\ncopies/mL at T0, and 197 responded to all inclusion criteria: M/F\n140/57; the median CD4+ cell count was 677 cells/mm ^3^ ; and HIV RNA at\nT0 was undetectable in 108 patients. Most of the 197 patients (122,\n61.9%) were on a previous INSTI-based regimen. HIV RNA undetectability\nwas more frequent at each follow-up point in patients with HIV RNA that\nwas undetectable at T0, and it showed a higher frequency throughout the\nfollow-up period in patients with always-undetectable HIV RNA in the 12\nmonths before the switch. A higher nadir CD4 cell count had a predictive\nrole, and HBcAb positivity had no influence. In conclusion, the switch\ncould be programmed and possibly delayed on a case-by-case basis in\norder to achieve persistent plasma HIV RNA undetectability. Undiagnosed\nloss of HBcAb has no detrimental consequences on the response to\nBIC/FTC/TAF.\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1. Study Design\n\nThis retrospective cohort study was conducted at 4 (Rome, Treviso,\nVicenza, and Venice) Italian Infectious Diseases Units and enrolled\noutpatients who were on successful ART and who had been switched to the\ndrug combination BIC/FTC/TAF in the period 2019--2022. The decision to\nstart the new regimen was up to the treating physician according to the\nupdated treatment guidelines \\[ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 \\] and was performed\nas a routine clinical practice. Inclusion criteria were plasma HIV RNA\n\\< 50 copies/mL at the time of viro-immunological testing performed less\nthan one month before the switch and only one viral load before the\nswitch was performed; negative HBsAg; and undetectable HCV RNA (because\nof never having been HCV infected, spontaneous clearance, or due to\nsustained virological response after antiviral treatment). Plasma HIV\nRNA performed less than one month before the switch corresponded to T0.\n\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Padova Province\n(protocol code 0033219, approved on 16 May 2019) and was performed in\naccordance with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki.\nThe patients gave written informed consent.\n\n### 2.2. Variables and Assessment Methods\n\nBaseline demographic and clinical characteristics were collected,\nincluding age, gender, ethnicity, age at diagnosis, age at switch,\nhepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis C serology, absolute number of CD4+\nT cell count at nadir, CD4+ T cell count at switch, and ongoing regimen\nbefore switch. The time of the switch was defined as the study's T0\npoint.\n\nOnly patients with plasma HIV RNA \\< 50 copies/mL at the testing before\nthe switch were included in the study. They were categorized as patients\nwith undetectable plasma HIV RNA and as patients with plasma HIV RNA\ndetectable but \\<50 copies/mL.\n\nThe control of plasma HIV viremia in the 12 months before the switch was\ncategorized into the following groups: not detected (undetectable plasma\nHIV viremia in all the tests); plasma HIV viremia \\< 50 copies/mL (at\nleast one test with a value \\< 50 copies/mL); and plasma HIV viremia ≥\n50 copies/mL (at least one test with a value ≥ 50 copies/mL).\n\nFor this study, the reasons for the switch were classified as follows:\n(1) treatment optimization; (2) simplification to a single-tablet\nregimen; (3) drug unavailability; (4) side effects; (5) drug--drug\ninteractions, (6) prevention of cardiovascular risk; (7) risk of\nvirologic failure---blip defined as a single plasma HIV RNA value\nbetween 50 and 500 copies/mL followed by an undetectable viral load \\[\n23 \\] or residual HIV viremia, defined as plasma HIV RNA values ranging\nfrom 50 to 100 copies/mL \\[ 24 \\]; (8) patient preference; and (9)\nunknown (not described). More than one reason for treatment change could\nbe reported. The follow-up study times were 6 (T6), 12 (T12), 18 (T18),\nand 24 (T24) months after the switch to BIC/FTC/TAF, and plasma HIV\nviremia and CD4+ cell count were evaluated at each follow-up study time.\nPlasma HIV RNA was classified as undetectable, detectable at \\<50\ncopies/mL, detectable ranging from 50 to 100 copies/mL, detectable\nranging from 101 to 1000 copies/mL, or detectable \\> 1000 copies/mL.\n\n### 2.3. Statistical Analysis\n\nConventional descriptive analysis was employed by reporting raw values,\nalongside mean and median values for quantitative data and percentages\nfor qualitative data. A multifaceted approach was used for inferential\nanalysis, depending on the outcome of interest. Three cohorts of\npatients were identified on the basis of plasma HIV RNA control in the\n12 months before the switch: always undetectable HIV RNA; plasma HIV\nviremia \\< 50 copies/mL; and plasma HIV viremia ≥ 50 copies/mL. The\nthreshold of significance was set at *p* \\< 0.05 for inferential\nanalysis.\n\nThe treatment efficacy, in terms of maintaining undetectable or low\nviremia after treatment, was reported as survival analysis with\nmultiple-failure-per-subject design. Kaplan--Meier survival estimates\nwere applied to analyze the response to treatment at the 4 follow-up\nstudy times (T6, T12, T18, and T24). This analysis was performed twice\naccording to two different levels of successful response: undetectable\nplasma HIV viremia (Panel A); and HIV RNA that is detectable at \\<50\ncopies/mL (Panel B). Since survival analysis considers the time interval\nand failure rate over time, only data from patients with at least two\nconsecutive observations could be used for this analysis. All patients'\ndata were used for the rest of the inferential analysis.\n\nThe relationship between the HIV viremia class and the CD4+ cell count,\nas outcome variables and other candidate predictor variables (patient\ncohort, hepatitis B core and hepatitis C serology, gender, and CD4+\nnadir), was investigated using multivariate analysis of variance\n(MANOVA), nested according to the follow-up study point (T6, T12, T18,\nT24). The MANOVA results were used to identify potential candidate\npredictors in successive regression analysis.\n\nThe relationship between the CD4+ cell count and candidate predictor\nvariables (patient cohort, hepatitis B core serology, and CD4+ nadir)\nwas investigated using multilevel linear regression, nested according to\nthe follow-up study point (T6, T12, T18, T24).\n\nLastly, the relationship between HIV viremia class and other candidate\npredictor variables (nadir and patient's cohort) was investigated using\na hierarchical ordered logistic model, nested according to the follow-up\nstudy point (T6, T12, T18, T24).\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using Stata v. 17.0. (StataCorp.,\nCollege Station, TX, USA; https://www.stata.com ; 2021) and MedCalc ^®^\nStatistical Software version 22.003 (MedCalc Software Ltd., Ostend,\nBelgium; https://www.medcalc.org ; accessed on 16 May 2023).\n\n\n\n## 3. Results\n\nA total of 329 PLWH had plasma HIV RNA that was undetectable or \\<50\ncopies/mL at T0: 98 were excluded because of lack of virological data of\nthe 12 months before the switch; 32 patients had positive HBsAg; and 2\nhad positive HCV RNA at the switch. A total of 197 patients were\nincluded in the study, and they were immunocompetent (median CD4+ cell\ncount was 677 cells/mm ^3^ ). HIV RNA at T0 was undetectable in 108\npatients. Most of the 197 patients (122, 61.9%) were on a previous\nINSTI-based regimen ( Table 1 ).\n\n\nOne reason for switching was reported for 158 PLWH (80.2%), two reasons\nfor twenty-five PLWH (12.7%), three reasons for one PLWH (0.5%), and no\ndata were available for thirteen PLWH (6.6%). Overall, treatment\noptimization (69, 35%) and simplification to a single-tablet regimen\n(62, 31.5%) were the most frequently reported reasons ( Table S1 ).\n\n### 3.1. Plasma HIV RNA Control in the 12 Months before the Switch, and Virological Response to BIC/FTC/TAF\n\nAt T0, 108 patients had undetectable HIV RNA and 89 had HIV RNA \\< 50\ncopies/mL.\n\nIn the previous 12 months, 67 (34%) patients had always undetectable HIV\nRNA, 99 (50.3%) had at least one test showing \\<50 copies/mL, and 31\n(15.7%) had at least one test showing ≥ 50 copies/mL. The median number\nof viral loads per patient in the 12 months prior to switch was three\n(IQR 2--3). Plasma HIV RNA undetectability was more frequent than plasma\nHIV RNA \\< 50 copies at T0 in PLWH with always-undetectable HIV RNA in\nthe 12 months before the switch (45.4% vs. 20.2%, *p* = 0.0002).\nConversely, plasma HIV RNA \\< 50 copies at T0 was more frequent in PLWH\nwith at least one test \\< 50 copies/mL HIV RNA in the 12 months before\nthe switch (64% vs. 38.9%, *p* = 0.0005) ( Table 2 ).\n\nLooking at the follow-up after the switch, plasma HIV RNA\nundetectability was most frequently detected in patients with\nundetectable HIV RNA at T0 with respect to patients with HIV RNA \\< 50\ncopies/mL at T0. At T6, T12, and T18, the differences were statistically\nsignificant ( *p* \\< 0.0001, *p* = 0.0088, and *p* = 0.0327,\nrespectively). Analysis via plasma HIV RNA control in the 12 months\nbefore the switch confirmed the higher frequency of plasma HIV RNA\nundetectability in patients with this optimal virologic response ( Table\n3 and Table 4 ).\n\n### 3.2. Plasma HIV RNA Control in the 12 Months before the Switch and Virological Response to BIC/FTC/TAF\n\nAn analysis of the HIV RNA value after the switch was performed by\napplying two different endpoints as successful responses at T0, T6, T12,\nT18, and T24: undetectable and detectable HIV RNA at \\<50 copies/mL. The\nfirst approach showed a significantly higher frequency of HIV RNA\nundetectability throughout the 24 months of follow-up in patients with\nall test with undetectable HIV RNA ( *p* \\< 0.001), with respect to the\npatients with plas-ma detectable HIV RNA before switch. The incidence\nrate ratio was 2.07; no difference was found between the patient groups\nwhen a higher viremia threshold was chosen. These data are detailed in\nTable 7 and Figure 1 .\n\nFigure 1\n\nKaplan--Meier survival estimates of virologic response during the 24\nmonths of follow-up according to two different endpoints defining a\nsuccessful response: plasma HIV viremia undetectable (Panel A); and HIV\nRNA detectable \\< 50 copies/mL (Panel B).\n\nThe analysis performed evaluating outcomes by the T0 viral load\nconfirmed data described above and elaborated by the previous 12 months\nbefore T0 ( Table 8 and Figure 2 ).\n\nFigure 2\n\nKaplan--Meier survival estimates of virologic response during the 24\nmonths of follow-up, according to two different endpoints defining a\nsuccessful response: undetectable plasma HIV viremia (Panel **A** ); and\nHIV RNA detectable at \\<50 copies/mL (Panel **B** ) by the T0 viral\nload.\n\nHBcAb (positivity vs. negativity), HCV serology (positivity vs.\nnegativity), the absolute number of CD4+ cells, and HIV RNA at T0 (ND\nvs. HIV RNA \\< 50 copies/mL) were the four variables evaluated as\npredictors of the outcomes mean CD4+ cell count value and HIV RNA\ncontrol (defined as undetectability vs de-tectability) at T6, T12, T18,\nand T24. The MANOVA results suggested that HIV RNA and the nadir CD4\ncell count could be candidate predictors for both outcomes at the same\ntime. A linear hierarchical model describing CD4+ cell count and viremia\nin relation to the candidate predictor variables is reported in Table 9\n, and CD4+ cell counts are reported in Table 10 . When plasma HIV RNA\ncontrol variable was plasma HIV RNA at T0 nadir cell count confirmed its\nrole in predict-ing undetectable plasma HIV RNA during follow up ( *p*\n\\< 0.001).\n\nUndetectability in the 12 months before the switch was associated with\nan 80% probability of maintaining undetectability; however, patients\nwith detectable HIV RNA had a 50% possibility of achieving HIV RNA\nundetectability in at least one of the follow-up study points ( Figure 3\n).\n\nFigure 3\n\nMarginal effect of plasma HIV viremia control in the 12 months before\nthe switch on plasma HIV RNA control at T6, T12, T18, and T24. Outcome\nis defined as undetectable HIV RNA (Panel A).\n\nWhen the evaluated outcome was HIV RNA \\< 50 copies/mL, we observed that\nalmost all PLWH with always-undetectable plasma HIV RNA in the 12 months\nbefore the switch achieved this goal, and the probability was \\>90%\nwhichever the virologic control in the 12 months before ( Figure 4 ).\n\nFigure 4\n\nDescription of the marginal effect of plasma HIV viremia control in the\n12 months before the switch on the plasma HIV RNA control at T6, T12,\nT18, and T24, defined as HIV RNA detectable at \\< 50 copies/mL (Panel\nB).\n\nThe roles of HBcAb status and HCV serology were also analyzed using a\nclassical survival analysis approach according to the different levels\nof plasma HIV viremia control, and no influence was found on either\noutcome ( Table 11 ).\n\n### 3.3. Influence of ART before the Switch to BIC/FTC/TAF\n\nThe influence of ongoing ART before the switch was evaluated in the 167\nPLWH treated with 2NRTI+INSTI (n = 100), 2 NRTI+NNRTI (n = 37), and 2\nNRTI+PI (n = 30) before the switch. ART INSTI-based treatment was the\nmost common ongoing regimen before the switch, except in PLWH who had\nalways undetectable plasma HIV viremia the year prior and plasma HIV RNA\n\\< 50 cop-ies/ml at T0 (subgroup previously ND) ( Table S2 ).\n\nFurthermore, we analyzed the frequency of HIV RNA undetectability\naccording to ongoing ART before the switch in the 60 PLWH, whose all\nfollow-up data were available.\n\nForty patients were treated with an INSTI-based regimen; regardless of\nHIV RNA at T0, 16 (40%) PLWH maintained undetectable HIV RNA. Notably,\n12 of the 16 patients were also undetectable at T0.\n\nOf twenty patients treated with a drug combination, not including INSTI,\nonly two (10%) PLWH, both negative at T0, were always ND, a frequency\nsignificantly lower than that in patients treated with INSTI ( *p* =\n0.018918).\n\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nIn high-income countries such as Italy, almost all PLWH on ART achieve\nand maintain virological suppression. For this reason, we designed this\nstudy to separately analyze patients with undetectable plasma HIV\nviremia before switching to BIC/FTC/TAF. Herein, we discussed three\naspects of the successful response to this regimen.\n\nFirst, this study demonstrated that long-term always-undetectable plasma\nHIV RNA before the switch was the main factor predicting the detection\nof this virological figure during the 24-month follow-up period;\nstarting treatment with BIC/FTC/TAF in place of the previous ongoing\nsuccessful ART regimen was demonstrated to maintain the previously\nachieved complete viral suppression; therefore, every PLWH can be safely\ntreated with the regimen considered as the best option on the basis of\ntheir own specific clinical characteristics in a real-world setting. Our\ndata on the efficacy of BIC/FTC/TAF in maintaining pre-existing\nvirological suppression in treatment-experienced PLWH are in accordance\nwith those of Micán et al. \\[ 25 \\], who showed that having plasma HIV\nRNA \\< 50 copies/mL before the switch was associated with the detection\nof this same HIV RNA value after 48 weeks of treatment.\n\nThe median age of patients included in our study was 53 years at the\nswitch, but only 34 years at diagnosis. Moreover, recently, it has been\nobserved that a significant proportion of the newly diagnosed PLWH are\nyoung \\[ 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 \\]. Due to long life expectancy, there may be\na curative therapy for HIV infection available in the future, but HIV\nreservoirs are a major obstacle to the eradication of HIV infection \\[\n30 \\], and it has been described that PLWH with sustained undetectable\nviremia have lower total HIV-DNA levels \\[ 31 \\]. We are aware that the\ndefinition of undetectable plasma HIV viremia which we adopted is not\ndefinitively correct because of the probable persistence of very low\nviral replication that is identifiable with ultrasensitive assays \\[ 32\n, 33 , 34 \\], but these methods are not routinely applied in clinical\npractice, and the undetectable level is the most stringent level among\nthose adopted in clinical studies.\n\nInterestingly, at T24, undetectable plasma HIV RNA frequency was\ncomparable in PLWH with plasma HIV RNA \\< 50 copies/mL and with\nundetectable HIV RNA at T0. Although it is important to interpret these\nfindings in the context of the study's small size, this result suggests\nthat the high forgiveness of the drug combination \\[ 35 \\] and/or a\nbictegravir human plasma unbound fraction (able to cross cell membranes\nand act on pharmacological sanctuaries), which can reach 6.7% \\[ 36 \\],\nmay have an impact on the long-term virological response.\n\nThe second result of our work is that a higher CD4+ count at the nadir\npredicted the achievement of undetectable HIV RNA; the median nadir\nvalue in PLWH enrolled in our study was 235 cells/mm ^3^ , a value\ncompatible with a low likelihood of immune activation \\[ 37 \\], and this\nmay be a possible explanation for these data, being some aspect of\nimmune activation associated with residual viremia \\[ 38 , 39 \\].\nArmenia et al. \\[ 9 \\] found no influence of the nadir on the\nvirological response in a study on PLWH who were switched to\nBIC/FTC/TAF; however, their statistical approach was different from ours\nbecause the nadir was evaluated as a dichotomic variable (≤200 cells/mm\n^3^ vs. \\>200 cells/mm ^3^ ) and the authors evaluated its role in\nvirological rebound (2 consecutive HIV RNA \\> 50 copies/mL or one test\n\\> 200 copies/mL); conversely, we considered CD4+ cell count as a\ncontinuous variable, and we considered the achievement of HIV RNA\nundetectability as an outcome during the 24-month follow-up period.\n\nFinally, we observed that HBcAb positivity did not influence the\nvirological response, a different result from that previously reported\nby our co-authors---Malagnino et al. \\[ 16 , 39 \\]---in PLWH switching\nto a two-drug ART regimen containing lamivudine. These authors reported\nthat HBcAb-positive PLWH had an OR of 2.7 after a 24-month follow-up\nperiod \\[ 16 \\], and of 7.46 after 48 months \\[ 39 \\] of HIV RNA\ndetectability with respect to HBcAb-negative PLWH. A possible\nexplanation for the lack of a role of previous HBV infection in our\nstudy is the presence of two drugs, TAF and FTC (both with antiviral\nactivity against HBV), in the regimen started after the switch with\nrespect to the treatment with lamivudine alone. HBcAb-positive PLWH\ncould be patients with occult HBV infection and, therefore, with\nintermittent and very low HBV-DNA (generally \\< 200 IU/mL) \\[ 40 \\].\nProlonged lamivudine therapy is associated with a risk of escape mutant\nemergence \\[ 41 , 42 \\]. An alternative hypothesis for the different\ninfluences of HBcAb positivity on HIV viremia could be the HIV reservoir\nload in hepatocytes; Zerbato et al. \\[ 43 \\] demonstrated the presence\nof HIV DNA in 61% of PLWH after more than 3 years of ART and virological\nresponse (plasma HIV RNA \\<50 copies/mL). In any case, treatment with\nBIC/FTC/TAF is safe in PLWH with positive HBcAb, and this result is\nimportant in light of the possible permanent or intermittent loss of\nHBcAb occurring in these patients \\[ 44 \\].\n\nLow-level viremia and blip are two laboratory results which are\nimportant in predicting virologic failure in patients on ART. This is an\nobject of debate because of contrasting results which have been\npublished, possibly due to the heterogeneity of the study designs and to\nthe involvement of unknown factors associated with the suboptimal\ncontrol of viral replication \\[ 45 , 46 , 47 \\]. Here, we discuss data\nfrom recent studies focusing on the influence of uncontrolled HIV\nviremia as blip (isolated plasma HIV RNA value \\< 1000 copies/mL with a\nreturn to undetectable levels) or as low-level viremia (plasma HIV RNA\nvalue 50--200 copies/mL) as defined by IAS-USA \\[ 13 \\].\n\nA recent retrospective analysis \\[ 48 \\] analyzing a European cohort of\n22,523 patients starting ART, and with 81,837 person-years of follow-up\n(2.8 years as median), described low-level viremia in 7% and blips in\n16% of patients. An increased risk of virological failure (defined as\ntwo consecutive plasma HIV RNA values ≥ 200 copies/mL or a single HIV\nRNA value ≥ 1000 copies/mL) was reported in association with both\ncategories of uncontrolled viremia. A slightly different definition of\nvirologic failure (two consecutive viral loads \\> 500 copies/mL) was\napplied by Fleming et al. \\[ 49 \\] in a study enrolling 2795 patients\n(8423 person-years of outpatient care) attending clinics in the United\nStates: 5.4% of patients experienced LLV; 19.9% patients experienced\nblips to 51--200 copies/mL; and 118 (4.2%) patients experienced blips to\n201--500 copies/mL. Overall, LLV was associated with virologic failure,\nbut blips were not; however, the association was significant in the\ncohort of patients with blips ranging from 201 to 500 copies/mL and no\nLLV. A third study including 10.124 Chinese patients with a median\nfollow-up duration \\> 4 years and a median interval of 6--12 months\nbetween samples collection reported a higher frequency of virologic\nfailure \\[ 50 \\]. According to the authors, statistical significance\ncould not be reached because of the small sample size (mean LLV rate was\n6.2%). Conversely, another study set in China on 2155 patients (median\nfollow-up time of 3.4 years) showed no increase in virological failure\nin patients with LLV (which has a frequency of 20.2%) or with blip.\nNotably, virological failure was defined as two or more consecutive\nplasma HIV RNA values \\> 1000 copies/mL \\[ 51 \\]. Chen et al. \\[ 52 \\]\nalso confirmed this lack of association in a cohort of 1485 patients in\nTaiwan: the study period lasted 18 months, and 1.4% of the 3646 HIV RNA\ntests performed met the criteria of LLV. The correlation between blips\nand LLV was analyzed by Dijkstra et al. \\[ 53 \\] in an observational\ncohort study which enrolled 1661 patients attending a Dutch hospital:\n308 blips were described in 247 patients during 3405 treatment courses\nwith a mean follow-up of 2.6 years. Interestingly, these authors showed\nthat blip was not associated with a higher frequency of consecutive\nplasma HIV RNA values \\> 50 copies/mL (not classified as virologic\nfailure) or virologic failure within that same treatment course.\n\nTaken together, these data suggest that a percentage of patients did not\nachieve a successful virological response despite a presumed adherence\nto treatment. A definite role is difficult to determine, but low-level\nviremia and blip seem to have different clinical significance, and\nquantification may be important for the latter. In any case, the\ninterplay between blip and LLV seems multifaceted, and may possibly be\ndifferent even within a single patient.\n\nThe limitations of our study include the retrospective design of the\nanalysis and the exclusion of patients lacking plasma HIV viremia\ncontrol data reported in sanitary records in the 12 months before the\nswitch. A portion of this period and of the study period itself occurred\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, and outpatients controls could not be\nperformed regularly and or/reported in clinical charts. On the other\nhand, we included in the study only PLWH who had previous virologic\nmonitoring results available with the aim to definitely select a cohort\nwith an optimal response to treatment and adherence.\n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions\n\nThe predictive role of undetectable HIV viremia in the year before the\nswitch in long-term virological success suggests that the switch could\nbe programmed and possibly delayed when simplification is the reason for\nand on a case by case basis, in accord with the patient to achieve\npersistent plasma HIV RNA undetectability. Moreover, undiagnosed loss of\nHBcAb has no detrimental consequences on the response to BIC/FTC/TAF. A\nlonger follow-up period is certainly needed in order to confirm the\npredictive role of the factors studied.\n\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThis research received no external funding, and the APC was funded by\nthe University of Padua, grant numbers DOR-2021 and DOR-2022, with\nfunding to S.G.P. and M.B.\n\n\n\n## Data Availability Statement\n\nThe raw data on demographics and clinical status of participants are\nprotected and not available due to data privacy laws.

We\nanalyzed retrospective longitudinal data from people living with HIV\n(PLHIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Kenya to understand LLV\nprevalence and virologic outcomes.\n\n### Methods\n\nWe calculated rates of virologic suppression (≤50 copies/mL), LLV\n(51--999 copies/mL), virologic non-suppression (≥1000 copies/mL), and\nvirologic failure (≥2 consecutive virologic non-suppression results)\namong PLHIV aged 15 years and older who received at least 24 weeks of\nART during 2015--2021. We analyzed risk for virologic non-suppression\nand virologic failure using time-dependent models (each viral load (VL)\n\\<1000 copies/mL used to predict the next VL).\n\n### Findings\n\nOf 793,902 patients with at least one VL, 18.5% had LLV (51--199 cp/mL\n11.1%; 200--399 cp/mL 4.0%; and 400--999 cp/mL 3.4%) and 9.2% had\nvirologic non-suppression at initial result. Among all VLs performed,\n26.4% were LLV. Among patients with initial LLV, 13.3% and 2.4%\nprogressed to virologic non-suppression and virologic failure,\nrespectively. Compared to virologic suppression (≤50 copies/mL), LLV was\nassociated with increased risk of virologic non-suppression (adjusted\nrelative risk \\[aRR\\] 2.43) and virologic failure (aRR 3.86). Risk of\nvirologic failure increased with LLV range (aRR 2.17 with 51--199\ncopies/mL, aRR 3.98 with 200--399 copies/mL and aRR 7.99 with 400--999\ncopies/mL). Compared to patients who never received dolutegravir (DTG),\npatients who initiated DTG had lower risk of virologic non-suppression\n(aRR 0.60) and virologic failure (aRR 0.51); similarly, patients who\ntransitioned to DTG had lower risk of virologic non-suppression (aRR\n0.58) and virologic failure (aRR 0.35) for the same LLV range.\n\n### Interpretation\n\nApproximately a quarter of patients experienced LLV and had increased\nrisk of virologic non-suppression and failure. Lowering the threshold to\ndefine virologic suppression from \\<1000 to \\<50 copies/mL to allow for\nearlier interventions along with universal uptake of DTG may improve\nindividual and program outcomes and progress towards achieving HIV\nepidemic control.\n\n### Funding\n\nNo specific funding was received for the analysis. HIV program support\nwas provided by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)\nthrough the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC).\n\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study design and participants\n\nWe used retrospective longitudinal VL data from the National AIDs and\nSTIs Control Programme (NASCOP) VL database of PLHIV on ART to assess\nLLV prevalence and subsequent virologic outcomes. We included PLHIV ≥15\nyears of age on standard first- or second-line ART for ≥24 weeks who had\nonly plasma VL results between January 2015 and December 2021. Baseline\nVL was defined as the first VL obtained after 24 weeks on ART. The\nfollowing VL result categories were used throughout the analysis period:\nvirologic suppression (defined as VL ≤ 50 copies/mL), three categories\nof LLV (VL 51--199, 200--399, and 400--999 copies/mL), and virologic\nnon-suppression (VL ≥ 1000 copies/mL). Patients who received third-line\nor non-standard ART, or whose records were missing were excluded. For\nvirologic non-suppression outcomes, patients who had \\<2 VL results or\nhad virologic non-suppression at first VL result after ≥24 weeks of ART\nwere excluded; for virologic failure outcomes, patients with \\<3 VL\nresults or virologic non-suppression (VLNS) at first VL were excluded (\nFig. 1 ).\n\nFig. 1\n\n**Study profile.** ART = antiretroviral therapy; VL = viral load;\nVLNS = virologic non-suppression; VF = virologic failure. ^†^ Included\npatients: 15--100 years of age at ART initiation, and initiated first or\nsecond-line ART between 2015 and 2021, and had at least 1 VL after 24\nweeks on ART, and had all viral loads done using plasma sample type.\n∗VLNS outcomes required at least two VLs with first VL \\< 1000 cp/mL; VF\noutcomes required at least 3 VLs with first VL \\< 1000 cp/mL. VF was\ndefined as the second and third VL ≥ 1000 cp/mL.\n\nKey available demographic variables, ART regimen, and VL results were\nextracted from the NASCOP VL database, a centralized source of reported\nVL data for all patients who receive VL testing from any of the 10\ncentral testing labs responsible for VL testing in the country.\n\n### Data analysis and outcomes\n\nPatients who met criteria for inclusion (PLHIV on ART who received VL\nmonitoring using plasma sample type from all HIV treatment sites in the\ncountry) were included in the analysis. No statistical inference was\nmade, and results do not include measures of uncertainty such as\nconfidence intervals given the use of population-level data. We\ncalculated the proportion of patient records with virologic suppression,\nLLV, and virologic non-suppression at first VL result. Prevalence of\nvirologic suppression, LLV, and virologic non-suppression was calculated\nby calendar year and duration on ART using the first VL result per year\nto avoid bias from multiple results within the same year.\n\nWe fit two sets of log binomial regression models to analyze the\nrelationship of viral loads to subsequent virologic non-suppression and\nvirologic failure. The first set of regression models, the\nnon-time-dependent models, used the first VL to predict any subsequent\nvirologic non-suppression and any subsequent virologic failure. The\nsecond set of models, the time-dependent models, used each available\npair of VLs a patient contributed with the first VL of the pair\npredicting virologic non-suppression at the second VL (with any pair\nexcluded if the first VL was ≥1000). The time-dependent models for\nvirologic failure used each triplet of VLs with the first VL predicting\nfailure at the second and third VLs. The purpose of the\nnon-time-dependent models was to determine the relationship between the\nfirst VL and longer-term outcomes. The time-dependent models, in\ncontrast, predicted shorter-term outcomes (the next consecutive VLs).\nPatients' records were censored after the relevant endpoint of interest.\nUnadjusted and adjusted relative risks (RR, aRR, respectively) were\ncalculated for each factor using bivariate and two different multiple\nregression models: one with a dichotomous variable indicating LLV and\none with a four-level variable (VL ≤ 50, VL 51--199, VL 200--499, and VL\n500--999 copies/mL). For both non-suppression and virologic failure, we\nfit bivariate and two multiple regression models: one with a dichotomous\nLLV variable, and one with a four-level variable for VL. To examine the\neffect of ART regimen on the relationship of LLV to virologic\nnon-suppression and virologic failure, we fit an additional set of\ntime-dependent log-binomial models that included a variable for the\ninteraction of VL category and drug regimen (no INSTI, only INSTI, and\ntransitioned to INSTI). VL results obtained after patients on\nINSTI-based regimens were reverted to a non INSTI-based regimen were\nexcluded from analysis. Adjusted relative risks for VL categories were\nreported by ART regimen history for this model. A final set of models\nexamined patterns of LLV episodes categorized as either single,\nintermittent, or consecutive, with intermittent LLV defined as two LLV\nresults with non-LLV result(s) in between, while consecutive LLV were\ndefined as 2 consecutive LLV results. Analyses were conducted in SAS v.\n9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\n\n### Ethical statement\n\nThe study received approval from African Medical and Research Foundation\n(AMREF) ethics and scientific review committee (Approval number\nP728/2020, January 17, 2020) and was reviewed in accordance with the CDC\nhuman research protection procedures and was determined to be research\nwhere CDC investigators were not engaged and did not interact with human\nsubjects. We obtained a waiver of informed consent since this study\nutilized retrospective routinely collected clinical data and thus did\nnot involve any patient interaction.\n\n### Role of the funding source\n\nNo specific funding was received for the analysis. HIV program support\nwas provided by the PEPFAR through the CDC. Funding sources for the\nparticipating ART facilities had no role in study design, data\ncollection, data analysis, data interpretation or writing of the report.\nThe corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study\nand had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\n\n\n## Results\n\nA total of 793,902 records from clients aged ≥15 years who initiated ART\nduring 2015--2021 had all VL tests done using plasma and had at least\none VL after 24 weeks on ART were included in the descriptive analysis\nof VL test outcomes. Of these, 316,584 (39.9%) met criteria for\ninclusion in the model of virologic non-suppression outcomes, and\n162,599 (20.5%) met criteria for inclusion in the model of virologic\nfailure outcomes ( Fig. 1 ). Median age at ART initiation was 34.1 years\n(interquartile range \\[IQR\\] 27.5--42.5); 550,447 (69.4%) were female.\nThe median patient follow-up duration on ART was 2.1 years (IQR\n1.1--3.6); the majority (64.1%) initiated ART during 2015--2017.\nOverall, 94.6% (751,189) of clients had exposure to tenofovir disoproxil\nfumarate (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC); 68.0%\n(539,773) had exposure to an NNRTI, 46.9% (372,382) to DTG, and 6.9%\n(54,918) to a protease-inhibitor (PI). Median time to first VL was 424\ndays. Just under one-half (44.5%) of patients had two or more VL\nresults. The majority (55.1%) of VL tests were performed during calendar\nyears 2019 and 2020 ( Table 1 ).\n\n### Prevalence of virologic suppression, low-level viremia, and virologic non-suppression\n\nAt first documented VL result, 72.3% (574,160) were suppressed at ≤50\ncopies/mL, 18.5% (146,690) had LLV (11.1% had 51--199 copies/mL, 4.0%\nhad 200--999 copies/mL, and 3.4% had 400--999 copies/mL), and 9.2%\n(73,052) had VL ≥ 1000 copies/mL. Of the initial VL results \\>1000,\n14.3% (10,467) were from patients on an INSTI-based regimen ( Table 2 ).\nAmong all VL results, 81.4% of patient records ever had a VL ≤ 50\ncopies/mL, 11.7% (93,111) had at least one episode of virologic\nnon-suppression, 2.3% (18,565) had virologic failure, and 26.4%\n(209,428) ever experienced LLV. Median time between consecutive VLNS was\n167 days. Among those who experienced LLV, the majority (55.8%) were\nwithin 51--199 copies/mL; 22.8% were between 200 and 399 copies/mL, and\n21.5% were between 400 and 999 copies/mL. The majority of LLV episodes\nwere single results, however, 22.8% (47,696) had two or more LLV\noccurrences ( Table 2 ). Between 2016 and 2021, the prevalence of\nvirologic non-suppression steadily decreased. During 2015--2017, the\nprevalence of LLV increased as virologic suppression (VS: ≤50 copies/mL)\ndecreased, with a trend reversal during 2017--2021, during which LLV\ndecreased as VS increased ( Fig. 2 a). With increasing years on ART, the\nprevalence of VS increased and both virologic non-suppression and LLV\ndecreased, especially within the 400--999 copies/mL range; clients on\nART for 4--6 years had the highest prevalence of VS around 80% ( Fig. 2\nb).\n\n### Association between LLV and virologic non-suppression and virologic failure outcomes\n\nOverall, 162,599 patients had at least two VL measurements following an\ninitial VL result of \\<1000 copies/mL. Among these, 72,156 (44.4%) had\nan initial VL result of LLV, of whom 7565 (10.5%) progressed to\nvirologic non-suppression, and 1672 (2.3%) progressed to virologic\nfailure. Progression to virologic non-suppression after LLV was similar\namong males (11.0%) and females (10.2%) overall, and highest in the age\ncategory 15--19 years (19.6% among males, 13.2% among females).\nProgression to virologic failure after LLV was also similar by sex (2.0%\namong males, 2.5% among females), and highest in the age category 15--19\nyears (5.9% among males, 3.80% among females) ( Supplementary Table S1\n).\n\nAmong the records included in the model for virologic non-suppression\n(309,628) and virologic failure (158,915), time-dependent regression\nmodels showed males aged 15--19 years had higher risk of virologic\nnon-suppression (aRR 2.08) and virologic failure (aRR 3.07) at the next\nVL relative to males who were 50 years or older ( Table 3 ). Similarly,\nfemales aged 15--19 years had higher risk for virologic non-suppression\n(aRR 1.37) and virologic failure (aRR 2.42) at the next VL relative to\nfemales 50 years or older. Patients aged 15--19 years had the highest\nrisk of virologic non-suppression (aRR 1.56) and virologic failure (aRR\n2.37) relative to all patients 50 years or older. Slightly more than\nhalf (350,587) of patients had not been exposed to an INSTI, 8.0%\n(48,088) were exposed to INSTIs from those who were ART naïve, and 33.3%\n(199,171) were transitioned to INSTIs from other ART regimens. Patients\nexposed to INSTI-based ART had a 39% and 63% lower risk for virologic\nnon-suppression and virologic failure, respectively, at the next VL.\nRelative to patients who did not receive an INSTI, those who initiated\nor transitioned to an INSTI had lower risk of virologic non-suppression\n(aRR 0.60, aRR 0.58, respectively) and virologic failure (aRR 0.51, aRR\n0.35, respectively). Relative to an initial VL result ≤50 copies/mL,\npatients with LLV had increased risk of virologic non-suppression (aRR\n2.33) and virologic failure (aRR 3.89) at their next VL, respectively.\nThe risk for virologic non-suppression increased from approximately two\nto four times across the LLV range categories relative to VS. A similar\ntrend was seen for risk of virologic failure, which increased from\napproximately two to eight times with increasing LLV range category,\nrelative to VS. LLV in the range of 400--999 copies/mL at the most\nrecent VL result had highest risk of virologic non-suppression (aRR\n3.98) and virologic failure (aRR 8.05) at the next VL ( Table 3 ).\n\nResults from a non-time-dependent model showed similar results with\nincreased risk of virologic non-suppression and virologic failure with\nhigher ranges of LLV, and decreased risk with INSTI exposure (\nSupplementary Table S2 ).\n\nCompared with patients with VS ≤50 copies/mL at their most recent VL\nresult, patients with LLV had lower rates of suppression to ≤50\ncopies/mL at their next VL, with lower rates with increasing LLV range\n(63.3% for 51--199 copies/mL, 54.6% for 200--399 copies/mL, 47.0% for\n400--999 copies/mL). Additionally, 19.5% of patients with virologic\nnon-suppression at their next VL were derived from individuals who had\nLLV at their most recent VL result. Of patients with virologic\nnon-suppression at the most recent VL, 39.3% had repeat virologic\nnon-suppression (i.e., virologic failure) at their next VL (\nSupplementary Figure/Table S3 ). Of the 2950 patients who failed after\nan initial VL \\< 1000 copies/mL, 738, or about 25% of them switched ART\nregimens.\n\nAcross all categories of LLV, patients on an INSTI-based ART had lower\nrisk for both virologic non-suppression and virologic failure as\ncompared to those on non INSTI-based ART, particularly in the case of\nvirologic failure following VL 400--999 copies/mL (INSTI only: aRR 1.39,\ntransitioned to INSTI: aRR 2.53, non-INSTI: aRR 8.60) ( Supplementary\nTable S4 ).\n\nThe pattern of LLV episodes was also associated with adverse virologic\noutcomes. Compared to patients with no record of LLV, those with\nconsecutive episodes of LLV had increased risk of both virologic\nnon-suppression and virologic failure (RR 2.93 and RR 4.42,\nrespectively), as did those with intermittent LLV (RR 1.72 and RR 2.86,\nrespectively) and a single episode of LLV (RR 1.71 and RR 2.73,\nrespectively) ( Supplementary Table S5 ).\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nKenya has made great strides towards achieving epidemic control, ^16^\nbut the full gains cannot be realized with the threat posed by LLV. In\nthis study, LLV was associated with subsequent virologic non-suppression\nand virologic failure in this large cohort. Similar to other studies, a\ndose response of higher risk at higher LLV ranges was observed with an\nalmost 8-fold increased risk at the highest LLV range. ^11^ ^,^ ^12^ ^,^\n^17^ We observed a 2-fold higher risk of virologic failure in patients\nwith a single LLV episode, and even higher with intermittent or\nconsecutive LLV episodes. We also observed a higher risk of virologic\nfailure in younger patients aged 15--19 years.\n\nVirologic suppression at ≤50 copies/mL increased from 2017 to 2020 with\nconcomitant declines in virologic non-suppression and LLV in the middle\nand higher ranges of 200--399 and 400--999 copies/mL, respectively.\nThese findings coincide with strategic program shifts including the\nintroduction of DTG, structured adherence support for higher range LLV\n(400--999 copies/mL), and plasma VL network expansion to routinely\nmonitor patients. Our study demonstrated improved patient outcomes among\npatients who received INSTI-based ART and protection from subsequent\nvirologic non-suppression (or virologic failure), supporting continued\naggressive DTG scale-up across all PLHIV subpopulations. ^18^ ^,^ ^19^\nNotably, 14% of patients with VLNS at initial VL were on INSTI-based\nART, underscoring the continued need for optimal adherence to ART.\n\nLower ART adherence has been associated with an increased risk of LLV,\nwith reports of a 5% decrease in adherence contributing to an\napproximately 10% increased risk of LLV. ^20^ Current Kenya MoH\nguidelines recommend patients receive EAC and repeat VL monitoring using\na VL threshold of 200 copies/mL and above. Given that patients with LLV\nat 51--199 copies/mL had an increased risk of virologic non-suppression\nand virologic failure compared to patients with ≤50 copies/mL,\ninterventions for lower range LLV, even single episodes, may prevent\nfuture negative virologic outcomes. Persistent LLV has been associated\nnot only with the risk of virologic failure and HIV drug resistance, but\nalso immune activation and inflammation that may lead to non-AIDS\ndefining events (NADES). ^21^ Viral reservoir size 22 , 23 , 24 and\nclonal expansion ^25^ ^,^ ^26^ have been linked to pLLV. Monitoring and\ninterventions for patients with pLLV are also a priority to ensure\noptimized ART options and to prevent accumulation of drug resistance\nmutations. Future research on LLV-associated acquired HIV drug\nresistance, the mechanisms of LLV-associated immune activation,\ninflammation and NADES, and clinical outcomes and the impact of LLV and\npLLV interventions on virologic suppression are also needed.\n\nOne of the goals of ART is to reduce the incidence of HIV, and studies\nhave shown zero estimates of HIV transmission risk through condomless\nsex with VL \\< 200 copies/mL. 27 , 28 , 29 The risk of future VL ≥ 200\ncopies/mL in individuals with LLV was found in our analyses and warrant\nmodelling data using dynamic VL status to understand the risk of HIV\ntransmission. An improved understanding of LLV associated HIV\ntransmission risk may add to the available HIV prevention and adherence\ntools, as well as enhance global Undetectable = Untransmittable (U=U)\nHIV prevention campaign efforts. ^30^\n\nOur study has several limitations. Although we analyzed routinely\ncollected data available through the national VL database, data quality\nmay have impacted results. Despite routine efforts to assess and improve\ndata quality, data de-duplication may not have been complete due to\nnon-standardized sample identification formats, therefore some patients\nmay appear more than once in the dataset due to inability to link their\nrecords. Analyses may have also been limited by missing VL test results\nin the database or missing variables that routinely accompany VL testing\nsuch as age, sex, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, treatment\ninitiation date, ART regimen, ART regimen line, and VL test\njustification. Given the requirement for two or more VL results for\ninclusion in the analysis of virologic failure, only 44.5% of patients\nwere included in those analyses. We were not able to determine, whether\nan ART regimen was 1st or 2nd line, measure ART adherence, or reasons\nfor ART regimen switch from the routinely collected data in the VL\ndatabase. Because of the limitations of the dataset and data quality\nissues, we were not able to develop a prediction model for VLNS or VF\nwith a high degree of accuracy, but as data quality improves, this may\nbe more feasible, and may be worth pursuing. During 2021, Kenya\nexperienced VL commodities shortages which led to lower VL coverage\nrates. Viral load data during this period may have come from specific\npatient populations that were prioritized by the MOH for VL testing and\nmay have impacted results. Despite these limitations, to the best of our\nknowledge, this analysis of real-world program data is from the largest\ndataset available in the public health sector, whose findings may apply\nto other LMIC countries.\n\nIn conclusion, our study showed a high prevalence of LLV and an\nincreased risk for virologic non-suppression and virologic failure, even\nat the lowest LLV range of 51--199 copies/mL, and after one episode of\nLLV. Optimized ART decreased the risk of future poor virologic outcomes.\nTo achieve and maintain HIV epidemic control, effective adherence\nsupport for all, especially for younger patients for durable virologic\nsuppression, remains pivotal. Lowering the individual and program\nbenchmarks of virologic suppression to \\<50 copies/mL, with timely\ntargeted interventions and differentiated care models for LLV may help\nprevent virologic failure, HIV-related morbidity and mortality, and HIV\ntransmission.\n\nNo specific funding was received for the analysis.

While 19 (54%) of these women had at least one HIV drug resistance mutation at virologic failure, most of these mutations were also detected in their enrollment samples. At study entry, drug resistance mutations were detected in 15 (36%) of 42 women with virologic failure, including 10 women in the efavirenz/emitricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group, and 5 women in the dolutegravir-containing groups.\nRationale: The paper mentions that 42 women experienced virological failure and had genotypic resistance testing performed. 42 at study entry and 35 at the time of failure.\nAnswer: 42\n\nPMID: 37399555\nQuestion ID: 1\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\nEvidence: Of the 2 patients with early virologic failure in the viremic group, 1 patient had a decrease in viral load less than 2 log ~10~ at the first maintenance injection (from 214 540 to 39 293 copies/mL). A nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutation (L100I) was present on genotypic testing at this time, and injections were discontinued. The patient had not chosen to initiate oral ART as of database closure, and additional genotypic testing showed a new Y181I mutation in the RT gene. Risk factors for failure were a V179V/I mutation in the RT gene at baseline and rifabutin use 2 weeks before initiation of LA CAB--RPV. The second patient with failure was also noted to have a decrease in viral load of less than 2 log ~10~ at the first maintenance injection (from 137 134 to 4371 copies/mL) and, although the HIV viral load at the third injection was less than 30 copies/mL, genotypic testing was successful and showed an E138K mutation in the RT gene and an R263K mutation in the integrase gene.

During the progression of the disease, some\nindividual patients acquire drug resistance due to mutational hotspots\non the viral proteins targeted by combination drug therapies. It has\nrecently been discovered that drug-resistant mutations accumulate on the\n\"flap region\" of the HIV-1 protease, which is a critical dynamic region\ninvolved in nonspecific polypeptide binding during invasion and\ninfection of the host cell. In this study, we utilize machine\nlearning-assisted comparative molecular dynamics, conducted at single\namino acid site resolution, to investigate the dynamic changes that\noccur during functional dimerization and drug binding of wild-type and\ncommon drug-resistant versions of the main protease. We also use a\nmultiagent machine learning model to identify conserved dynamics of the\nHIV-1 main protease that are preserved across simian and feline protease\northologs. We find that a key conserved functional site in the flap\nregion, a solvent-exposed isoleucine (Ile50) that controls flap dynamics\nis functionally targeted by drug resistance mutations, leading to\namplified molecular dynamics affecting the functional ability of the\nflap region to hold the drugs. We conclude that better long-term patient\noutcomes may be achieved by designing drugs that target protease regions\nthat are less dependent upon single sites with large functional binding\neffects.\n\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### PDB structure and model preparation\n\nProtein structures of WT and mutant HIV-1 protease bound and unbound to\ndrug inhibitors were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Summary\nof the different PDB structures used for the MD simulation runs are\nlisted in Table 1 . After downloading the structures from the PDB\ndatabase, any crystallographic reflections, ions, and other solvents\nused in the crystallization process were removed. Any missing loop\nstructures in the protein structures were inferred using the SWISS-MODEL\nhomology modeling server ( 14 , 15 ). Using pdb4amber (AmberTools20),\nhydrogen atoms were added, and crystallographic water molecules were\nremoved ( 16 ).\n\n### Molecular dynamic simulation protocols\n\nFor each MD comparison (monomer versus dimer, WT versus mutant protease;\nprotease bound and unbound to drug), large replicate sets of accelerated\nMD simulations were performed. MD simulation protocol was followed as\npreviously described, with slight modifications ( 11 , 12 , 17 , 18 , 19\n). In brief, for each MD comparison, large replicate sets of accelerated\nMD simulation were prepared and then conducted using the particle mesh\nEwald method implemented on A100 and V100 NVIDIA graphical processor\nunits by pmemd.cuda running Amber20 ( 16 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ). The MD\nsimulations were on a high-performance computing cluster hosted by\nRochester Institute of Technology (Rochester, NY) ( 24 ). All\ncomparative MD analysis via our Detecting Relative Outlier Impacts in\nDynamic Simulation 4.0 (DROIDS 4.0) was based upon 100 replicated sets\nof 1-ns accelerated MD runs (i.e., 100 × 1 ns MD run in each comparative\nstate, e.g., monomer versus dimer, WT versus mutant, protease bound to\ndrug versus protease unbound to drug). Explicitly solvated protein\nsystems were first prepared using pdb4amber to add hydrogens and remove\ncrystallographic waters and then solvated and charge-neutralized using\ntLeap (AmberTools 20), using ff14SSB protein force field, in conjunction\nwith modified GAFF2 small molecule force field ( 25 , 26 ). Solvation\nwas generated using the Tip3p water model in a 12-nm octahedral water\nbox. Charge neutralization was performed using Na ^+^ and Cl ^--^ ions\nusing the Ambertools20 tLeap program. We note that charge neutralization\ncan be controlled more directly by the user in the MD simulation, via\nalternate methods allowing for dynamically fluctuating salt pairs ( 27\n), and opted to work in neutralized salt environments for our simulation\nstudies. Force field modifications for the small molecule ligands were\ngenerated using scaled quantum mechanical optimization via the sqm\nversion 17 program in antechamber/Amber20 ( 28 ). For each MD\ncomparison, an energy minimization was first performed and then heated\nto 300 K for 300 ps, followed by 100 ns of equilibration, a 100\nreplicate set of random time spacing runs between 0 and 0.5 ns, and then\nfinally a replicate set of 100 MD production runs was created for each\ncomparative state. Each MD production run was simulated for 1 ns of\ntime. All simulations were regulated using the Anderson thermostat at\n300 K and 1 atm ( 29 ). Root mean-square atom fluctuations and atom\ncorrelations were conducted in CPPTRAJ using atomicfluct and atomicorr\ncommands ( 30 ).\n\n### Comparative protein dynamic and statistical analyses with DROIDS 4.0\n\nAn overview of the DROIDS 4.0 pipeline is available in our software\nnotes ( 11 , 12 , 19 ). In brief, comparative signatures between the\nquery and reference protein were presented as site-wise divergence in\natom fluctuation. Site-wise divergences were calculated using signed\nsymmetric Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence calculation in DROIDS 4.0.\nSignificance tests and p-values for the site-wise differences were\ncalculated using a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test with the less\nconservative Benjamin-Hochberg multiple test correction. The\nmathematical and statistical details of DROIDS 4.0 site-wise comparative\nprotein dynamic analysis were published previously by our group ( 11 ,\n12 , 18 , 19 ). Furthermore, the code for our DROIDS 4.0 pipeline is\navailable at our GitHub web landing:\nhttps://gbabbitt.github.io/DROIDS-4.0-comparativeprotein-dynamics/ ,\nwhich is also available at our GitHub repository\nhttps://github.com/gbabbitt/DROIDS-4.0-comparative-protein-dynamics .\nFor readers wishing for tutorial introductions to the software, we\nspecifically highlight reference ( 19 ), as well as the tutorials\navailable on the GitHub landing site.\n\n### Identifying regions of conserved dynamics with maxDemon 2.0\n\nAn overview of the maxDemon 2.0 pipeline using the HIV-1 protease dimer\nas the query protein and the HIV-1 protease monomer as the reference\nprotein is shown in Fig. S1 . In summary, this method trains a\nmultiagent learning model comprised of seven learning methods (adaboost,\nrandom forest, decision tree, support vector machines with linear and\nradial basis function kernels, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic\ndiscriminant analysis, naïve Bayes, and K nearest neighbors) on the\nmonomer and dimer dynamic states in human HIV-1 protease. The learner is\nthen deployed upon simulations of evolutionary orthologs in unclassified\nfunctional states of dimerization (i.e., the learner attempts to\nclassify the site-wise ortholog dynamics as either human monomer or\ndimer). The feature vector for the multiagent learner is composed of the\natom fluctuations at a given site as well as atom correlations taken at\n1, 3, 5, and 9 sites downstream on the structure. The multiagent learner\nis a stacked model comprised of K nearest neighbors, naïve Bayes, linear\ndiscriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, support vector\nmachine, random forest, and adaptive gradient boosting algorithms\nemployed in R language packages (base, MASS, kernlab, adaboost, and\nrandomForest). This classification is attempted at every 50-frame time\nslice of a 10-ns simulation, and the frequency of correct classification\nat each site is calculated. A learning profile curve is generated across\nall sites of the protein, where values of 0.5 indicate learning is\nrandom, and the dynamics of a particular site are indistinguishable as\nto whether the protease is in a monomerized or dimerized functional\nstate. Values of 0 or 1 on the learning profile indicate 100% successful\nmachine learning classification of the functional states (dimer = 0,\nmonomer = 1). A canonical correlation analysis of the seven learning\nprofiles for each method generated on the human and ortholog dynamics\nand hypothesis test with Wilk's lambda (alpha \\< 0.01) was used to\nidentify regions with significantly conserved dynamics. The orthologs we\nused for human HIV-1 protease (PDB: 6DGX ) included several simian SIV\nproteases and a single feline FIV protease (PDB: 1YTG , 1YTH , 1YTI ,\n1YTJ , and 1B11 ) ( 31 , 32 ). For more detailed information, see our\nprevious software publications and protocols ( 11 , 12 , 19 ).\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### HIV-1 protease and its inhibitors\n\nThe HIV-1 protease is a homodimeric aspartyl protease enzyme, with each\nmonomeric subunit comprising 99 amino acid residues, and with the\ncatalytic aspartic acid (D) residue at position 25 as part of the common\ntriad Asp-Thr-Gly. Fig. 1 shows a ribbon diagram of HIV-1 protease, with\nmain domains indicated. The single catalytic site occurs across the\ntwofold symmetry axis between the two monomers, so only the dimeric form\nof the protein is active. An important flap domain near the top of the\ndimer (subunit residues 45--54) undergoes pronounced translocation to\ncreate substrate access to the active site. The protease is essential\nfor the HIV-1 replication cycle, as it processes the GAG and GAG-POL\npolyproteins into the functional components needed for maturation of the\nintact HIV virion. Structural characterizations of the protein have\nhighlighted key motions of the protease in its catalytic cycle ( 33 , 34\n). The importance of dynamics in HIV-1 protease function led us to\nexamine further using comparative dynamics tools to assess the role of\nprotein motion in the overall evolution of protease inhibitor drug\nresistance.\n\nFigure 1\n\nSchematic diagram of ( *A* ) HIV-1 gnome and the ( *B* ) protease dimer.\n( *A* ) The total size of the HIV-1 genome is approximately 9.7 kb. The\nHIV-1 viral genes are drawn based on the RNA genome's relative\norientation. Arrow points to the cleaved protein products. The dashed\nline represents RNA splicing.

( *B* ) The cartoon diagram of HIV-1\nprotease (PDB: 6DGX ) shows the monomers in light orange and dark\norange. Key regions of the protease are labeled, and the relevant\nresidue numbers are denoted in parenthesis.\n\n### HIV-1 protease dimerization causes dampening of atom fluctuation in the flap region\n\nHIV-1 protease exists in its active form as a homodimer. To investigate\ndimerization's importance, we conducted comparative dynamics between the\nHIV-1 protease monomer and the HIV-1 protease dimer bound to a peptide\nligand. In this particular MD simulation, the monomer was the reference\nstate, and the dimer was the query state ( Fig. 2 *A* ). We first looked\nat the average flux of the dimer and monomer as a function of the amino\nacid position ( Fig. 2 *C* ). The average flux profiles for the monomer\nand the dimer are comparatively different, as expected. The process of\ndimerization of the HIV-1 protease has drawn considerable attention, as\nonly the dimeric enzyme is functional, and both experimental and\ncomputational studies have attempted to understand the mechanistic steps\nof dimer formation ( 35 , 36 ). Indeed, prevention of dimerization is a\npotential therapeutic target ( 37 ), and the PI drug darunavir has\nantidimerization actions in addition to being an active-site binder\nblocking catalytic function ( 38 ). Our study contributes further to\nthis work in its examination of comparative dynamics.\n\nFigure 2\n\nSite-wise effects of functional dimerization in HIV-1 protease on\nmolecular dynamics. ( *A* ) The molecular dynamics of the HIV-1 protease\ndimerization function were compared by querying the peptide-bound dimer\nagainst the unbound monomer (from PDB: 6dgx ). ( *B* ) A key site\ndriving functional dimerization is isoleucine at position 50, which is\ndouble flanked by glycine (i.e., GGIGG) at the tip of the main protease\n\"flap.\" This highly solvent-exposed nonpolar hydrophobic site is highly\ndampened during dimerization ( *indicated in blue* ). This is also\nrepresented in the site-wise plots of ( *C* ) atom fluctuations in\nmonomer and dimer, ( *D* ) signed KL divergence metric, and ( *E* ) the\ntwo-sample KS hypothesis test as a function of amino acid position.\nILE50 and catalytic site are shown in the ( *D* ) KL divergence plot.\n\nFurthermore, the average atom fluctuation value for the dimer is lower\nthan the monomer, mainly due to the structure being stabilized by\ndimerization and existing with its native polypeptide ligand. To\ninvestigate further and tease out any amino acid-specific importance, we\nlooked at the site-wise divergence between the monomer and dimer, which\nwas calculated using signed symmetric KL divergence ( Fig. 2 *D* ). We\nobserved negative signed KL divergences at all amino acid positions,\nindicating a universal dampening of atomic fluctuation at all sites in\nthe dimer state. Furthermore, we observe a more substantial dampening of\natomic fluctuation at the catalytic site (Asp25, Thr26, and Gly27) and\nIle50 ( Fig. 2 *B* and *D* ). As expected, forming a proper homodimer is\nessential for an active catalytic site in HIV-1 protease. Other studies\nhave also shown the importance of Ile50, with the position only\ntolerating a handful of amino acid substitutions ( 39 ). Ile50 residue\nis a part of the flap region and plays a crucial role in stabilizing the\nprotease's open confirmation. Lastly, we also observe a dampening of\natomic fluctuation in the N-terminal residues 1--5 ( Fig. 2 *D* ). The\nN-terminal residues 1--4 contribute to dimer stability in the protease (\n40 ). When the dampening of the atomic fluctuations was color mapped to\nthe HIV-1 protease, we observed that the strongest dampening happened\nacross the flap regions of the dimer ( Fig. 2 *B* ). To further confirm\nthat the dampening of atomic fluctuations is significant, we calculated\np-values across each amino acid residue using a two-sample KS test with\nthe less conservative Benjamin-Hochberg multiple test correction. We see\nthat the atomic fluctuation differences are significant from the\nN-terminus to the C-terminus of the protease ( Fig. 2 *E* ).\n\n### Importance of functionally conserved dynamics in the HIV-1 protease dimerization\n\nFunctionally conserved dynamics are defined as repeated,\nsequence-dependent dynamics discovered after training machine learners\non the functional state ensembles derived from our DROIDS pipeline. To\ndetect functionally conserved dynamics after training and validation, an\nadditional new MD run matching the functional reference state is\nsimulated. The learning performance of this run is compared with the MD\nvalidation run using a canonical correlation analysis conducted using\nall selected learners across both space and time ( 12 ). Any\nsequence-dependent or functionally conserved dynamics can be recognized\nthrough a significant canonical correlation in the profile of the\noverall learning performance along the amino acid positions for the two\nsimilar state runs ( 11 , 12 ). See Fig. S1 for a schematic overview of\nthis analysis.\n\nTo identify sites of functionally conserved dynamics, the maxDemon\nmultiagent classifier was deployed on each site. From this, a learning\nperformance profile across all sites on the protein is generated. We\nfirst compared the multiagent learning methods across HIV-1 protease\ndimer, HIV-1 protease monomer, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)\nprotease monomer, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) protease\nmonomer ( Fig. S2 ). In Fig. S2 *A* -- *D* , an average classification\nof 0 or 1 indicated perfect learning classification at a given site,\nwhereas an average learning classification of 0.5 indicates no learning\nwas achieved at that respective site. Robust learning is observed at\nIle50, a key residue of the flap region, across all dimers and monomers.\nAs one might anticipate, we also observed strong learning in the\ncatalytic site of the proteases (Asp25, Thr26, and Gly27). We also see\nnear-perfect learning at the N-terminus ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ), residues\nthat are known to contribute to dimer stability.\n\nTo further investigate the importance of Ile50, we identified sites\nwhere functionally conserved dynamics are observed using a learning\nprofile. Using the multiagent classifier, we compared the classification\nof HIV-1 protease and SIV protease ( Fig. S3 ). We observed a highly\ncorrelated multiagent learning classification for the dimerized HIV-1\nand SIV protease ( Fig. S3 *A* ). Notably, a strong majority of amino\nacid residues (∼90%) between the HIV-1 protease and SIV protease dimer\nshow regions of conserved dynamics with high R values from the canonical\ncorrelational analysis ( Fig. S3 *B* and *C* ). These analyses suggest\nthat the functional sites involved in dimerization, catalysis, and\nstabilization in HIV-1 protease have been maintained over viral\nevolution as different mammalian strains have arisen.\n\n### Protease inhibitors cause dampening of atom motions in the flap region of the wild-type HIV-1 protease\n\nThe US FDA has approved nine PIs to treat HIV infection. However, some\nof the inhibitors are no longer used due to their high dosage\nrequirements and side effects. We employed our comparative dynamics\nframework to investigate binding and behavior of two PIs in current\nclinical use: darunavir, which was approved in 2006, and lopinavir,\napproved in 2000. Both of these regimens require boosting with a low\ndose of the first-generation PI rotinavir, which functions to alter\nmetabolism of the PIs, rendering them more bioavailable.\n\nDarunavir is one such US FDA-approved protease inhibitor with high\nbinding affinity and can be effective against strains where resistance\nto other inhibitors has developed ( 41 , 42 ). To understand the binding\ninteraction of darunavir with HIV-1 protease, we did MD simulations with\nHIV-1 protease bound and unbound to darunavir. To compare atomic\nfluctuation between HIV-1 protease bound and unbound to darunavir, we\nused site-wise KL divergence along with multiple test-corrected\ntwo-sample KS tests. The more negative the KL divergence value of a\nspecific amino acid residue is, the stronger is the dampening of atomic\nfluctuations due to darunavir's interactions with protease. In contrast,\nthe more positive the KL divergence value of a specific amino acid\nresidue is, the stronger is the amplification of the atomic fluctuations\ndue to darunavir's interaction with the protease.\n\nComparative analyses of protein dynamic simulations of darunavir-bound\nWT HIV-1 protease (PDB: 6DGX ) and an unbound apo form of WT HIV-1\nprotease (PDB: 2PC0 ) show strong dampening of the key functional sight\nIle50 on both chains A and B of the darunavir-bound dimer ( Fig. 3 )\nwith more pronounced general dampening of atom fluctuation on chain A.\nWe suspect this asymmetry in our result may be due to asymmetry in the\nprotease structure caused by the asymmetry of the darunavir structure\nitself. We color-mapped the fluctuation of the atom motion. We observed\ndampening of the atom motion in the tightly closed flap region of the\nprotease when darunavir is bound to HIV-1 protease, indicating that the\nflap region plays a role in the binding of darunavir ( Fig. 3 *A--C* ).\nOther studies have also found that binding of darunavir alters the flap\nregion, with some studies finding that darunavir binding exhibits a\nunique curling confirmation of the flap region, whereas others observing\nextended flap conformations ( 43 , 44 ). We also calculated significance\ntests and p-values for these site-wise differences. We observed\nsignificant atomic fluctuation motion in the key functional region near\nIle50 in both chains A and B as well as near the catalytic site on chain\nB ( Fig. 3 *D* and *E* ).\n\nFigure 3\n\nAnalysis of flap region stabilization during darunavir binding to WT\nHIV-1 protease. ( *A--C* ) The signed Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\nor distance between the distribution in atom fluctuation due to\ndarunavir binding in the main protease dimer is compared in the\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations of darunavir-bound wild-type HIV-1\nprotease dimer (PDB: 6DGX ) and wild-type apo HIV-1 protease dimer (PDB:\n2PC0 ) and color mapped to PDB: 6DGX .

The top view is shown\nwithout transparency in full ambient occlusion so as to highlight the\nstructural opening/closing of the flap region.

The alpha level for the test is 0.01. ns denotes\nnonsignificant changes in dynamics at the given site. The key functional\nsite (ile50) on the protease flap region (see Fig. 2 ) is also labeled.\nAlso note Y axes are auto-scaled.\n\nTo investigate the consistency of this functional response of the WT\nHIV-1 protease to other drugs, we conducted the same analysis comparing\na pepstatin-bound WT HIV-1 dimer (PDB: 5HVP ) to the apo form (PDB: 2PC0\n)( Fig. S4 ). Here we observe a similar signature of significant\ndampening of atom fluctuation at the same key functional site of the\nflap region. However, the asymmetry in this case shows stronger effect\nin chain A rather than chain B. Further investigation into the\nconsistency of our results with respect to chain asymmetry in the\nreference comparison structure is presented in Fig. S5 .\n\n### Drug-resistant mutations amplify the atom motions in the flap region of the HIV-1 protease\n\nThe selection pressure of darunavir has induced a genetic variant that\nresists the inhibitory effects of the drug. The structure of this\nvariant bound to darunavir is databased as PDB: 6OPV . Comparative\nanalyses of protein dynamic simulations of darunavir-bound\ndrug-resistant mutant HIV-1 protease (PDB: 6OPV ) and an unbound apo\nform of WT HIV-1 protease (PDB: 2PC0 ) show strong significant and\nsymmetric amplification of atom motion at the key functional site Ile50\non both chains A and B of the darunavir-bound dimer ( Fig. 4 ). Close-up\ncomparison of the WT and mutant catalytic site where darunavir binds is\nshown in Fig. 5 .\n\nFigure 4\n\nAnalysis of flap region destabilization during darunavir binding to\ndrug-resistant HIV-1 protease. ( *A--C* ) The signed Kullback-Leibler\n(KL) divergence or distance between the distribution in atom fluctuation\ndue to darunavir binding in the main protease dimer are compared in the\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations of darunavir-bound mutant HIV-1\nprotease dimer (PDB: 6OPV ) and wild-type apo HIV-1 protease dimer (PDB:\n2PC0 ) and color mapped to PDB: 6OPV . Three orientations are shown: (\n*A* ) front, ( *B* ) top, and ( *C* ) back. The top view is shown\nwithout transparency in full ambient occlusion so as to highlight the\nstructural opening/closing of the flap region. Blue denotes a KL\ndivergence representative dampened atom motions in the MD comparison,\nwhereas red denotes amplified motions (range is --0.75 to 0.75). ( *D*\nand *E* ) Site-wise plots of KL divergence ( *top* ) and d-values from\ntwo-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests corrected for false discovery rate (\n*bottom* ) on ( *D* ) chain A and ( *E* ) chain B are given for more\nfine detail. The alpha level for the test is 0.01. ns denotes\nnonsignificant changes in dynamics at the given site. The key functional\nsite (ile50) on the protease flap region (see Fig. 2 ) is also labeled.\nThe positions of the key drug-resistant mutations (I13V, G16E, V32I,\nL33F, K45I, M46I, V82F, I84V) are approximated with white \"X.\" Note Y\naxes are auto-scaled.\n\nFigure 5\n\nClose-up positioning of darunavir in the ( *A* ) wild-type HIV-1\nprotease dimer PDB: 6DGX and ( *B* ) drug-resistant HIV-1 protease dimer\nPDB: 6OPV . In the color-mapping, blue denotes a signed KL divergence\nrepresentative of ( *A* ) dampened atom motions in the MD comparisons to\napo HIV-1 protease dimer (PDB: 2PC0 ), whereas ( *B* ) red denotes\namplified motions in the same MD comparison to PDB: 2PC0 (range\nis --0.75 to 0.75).\n\nLike darunavir, lopinavir is another HIV-1 protease inhibitor with high\nspecificity for the protease. We wanted to investigate the importance of\nthe flag region further. MDR769 is an HIV strain that has accumulated\nmultiple drug resistance mutations in the protease, which has resulted\nin the decreased potency of PIs against HIV. MDR769 consists of 10 amino\nacid substitutions in the protease: L10I, M36V, M46L, I54V, I62V, L63P,\nA71V, V82A, I84V, and L90M ( 45 ). Therefore, we performed MD simulation\nusing multidrug-resistant 769 (MDR769) strain bound and unbound to\nlopinavir. Unlike our previous simulation with darunavir, MDR769 is\nresistant to lopinavir. Compared with WT HIV-1 protease, MDR769 has\nabout 4.3-fold drug resistance against lopinavir ( 46 ). Comparative MD\nsimulation of lopinavir-bound MDR769 bound to the apo form of the WT\ndimer (PDB: 2PC0 ) also shows strong significant signatures of\namplification of atomic motion in both chains of the protease ( Fig. 6\n). This pattern is asymmetric with stronger affect in chain A. The\nmutation of MDR769 in the flap region results in a \\\"wide-open\\\"\nstructure representing an opening that is 8 Å wider than the \\\"open\\\"\nstructure of the WT protease ( 47 ). This is clearly evident in the\nambient occlusion image ( Fig. 6 *B* ). This prevents clashing of amino\nacid side chains in the flap region. MDR769 is also associated with a\ndecrease in the volume of amino acid side chains with the active site\ncavity ( 48 ). This provides additional space for the amino acid side\nchains of the flap region to destabilize.\n\nFigure 6\n\nAnalysis of flap region destabilization during lopinavir binding to\nmultidrug resistant HIV-1 protease MDR-769. ( *A--C* ) The signed\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence or distance between the distribution in\natom fluctuation due to lopinavir binding in the main protease dimer is\ncompared in the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of lopinavir-bound\nmutant HIV-1 protease dimer (PDB: 4L1A ) and wild-type apo HIV-1\nprotease dimer (PDB: 2PC0 ) and color mapped to PDB: 4L1A . Three\norientations are shown: ( *A* ) front, ( *B* ) top, and ( *C* ) back.\nThe top view is shown without transparency in full ambient occlusion so\nas to highlight the structural opening/closing of the flap region. Blue\ndenotes a KL divergence representative dampened atom motions in the MD\ncomparison, whereas red denotes amplified motions (range is --0.75 to\n0.75). ( *D* and *E* ) Site-wise plots of KL divergence ( *top* ) and\nd-values from two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests corrected for false\ndiscovery rate ( *bottom* ) on ( *D* ) chain A and ( *E* ) chain B are\ngiven for more fine detail. The alpha level for the test is 0.01. ns\ndenotes nonsignificant changes in dynamics at the given site. The key\nfunctional site (ile50) on the protease flap region (see Fig. 2 ) is\nalso labeled. The positions of the key drug-resistant mutations (32I,\nL33F, 46I, 47A, I54V, V82A, I84V, and L90M) are approximated with white\n\"X.\" Note Y axes are auto-scaled.\n\nLastly, we conducted a comparative MD analysis to isolate the dynamic\neffects of the key darunavir resistance mutations in PDB: 6DGX from the\ndynamic effects of binding by comparing the site-wise divergence in atom\nfluctuations in the darunavir-bound mutant (PDB: 6OPV ) to the\ndarunavir-bound WT HIV-1 protease (PBD: 6DGX ) ( Fig. 7 ). Thus the only\ndifference in the structures and their dynamics was induced by the\nsubstitutions at sites I13V, G16E, V32I, L33F, K45I, M46I, V82F, and\nI84V. Here, we find a clear, strong, and significant signature of\namplified atom motion in the flap region that is independent of drug\nbinding, further supporting the functional implication of these amino\nacid substitutions in combining to alter the flap dynamics in the\nvicinity of Ile50. Most of the evolutionary changes observed over time\nin these drug-resistant variants are nearly neutral and do not much\nalter the amino acid type. The only exceptions to this are the two\ncharge-altering mutations in the darunavir-resistant form (i.e., G16E\nand K45I). The lopinavir-resistant variant exhibits no mutations that\nalter amino acid type. This suggests that the combined effect on\ndynamics is not always easily interpretable from the perspective of\namino acid composition and protein sequence alone.\n\nFigure 7\n\nAnalysis of flap region destabilization due to mutations present in\ndrug-resistant HIV-1 protease. ( *A--C* ) The signed Kullback-Leibler\n(KL) divergence or distance between the distribution in atom fluctuation\ndue to darunavir resistant mutations in the main protease dimer is\ncompared in the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of darunavir-bound\nmutant HIV-1 protease dimer (PDB: 6OPV ) and wild-type darunavir-bound\nwild-type HIV-1 protease dimer (PDB: 6DGX ) and color mapped to PDB:\n6DGX .

The top view is shown without transparency in full ambient\nocclusion so as to highlight the structural opening/closing of the flap\nregion.

The alpha level for\nthe test is 0.01. ns denotes nonsignificant changes in dynamics at the\ngiven site. The key functional site (ile50) on the protease flap region\n(see Fig. 2 ) is also labeled. The positions of the key drug-resistant\nmutations (I13V, G16E, V32I, L33F, K45I, M46I, V82F, I84V) are\napproximated with white \"X.\" Note Y axes are auto-scaled.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nSubstantial effort has gone into elucidating the important role of\nprotein structure and motion in the function and resistance development\nof HIV-1 protease. Our comparative dynamics study identifies and\nunderscores some of the key molecular motions that play a role in\nprotease inhibitor drug resistance. Our DROIDS 5.0 analytical tool is\ncapable of locating critical dynamics at a residue-level of specificity\nusing site-wise divergences computed from ensembles of MD runs comparing\na query and reference protein structures along with statistical tools\nfor evaluation. The inclusion of the stacked machine learner maxDemon\n2.0 provides additional information on which protein regions possess\nfunctionally conserved dynamics, maintained over evolutionary time since\nthe divergence of simian and feline lineages from that of our own. Our\nmaxDemon analysis probes the orthologs to the viral protease from a\nhuman-infecting HIV-1that exist in viruses infecting these related\nmammalian backgrounds. The idea is that the SIV and FIV viruses will\nhave evolved proteases within their respective hosts, and that\ncomparison of the orthologs will inform on which functional viral\nprotein motions are retained in the diverse mammalian lineages. We\ninvestigated dimerization in HIV-1 protease, a process with strong\nexperimental evidence for structure stabilization upon dimerization with\nconcomitant motion dampening, as a confirmatory check on our methods.\nOur study detects the global stabilization of the dimeric form, seen in\nsignatures of damped motion of negative KL divergence in atom\nfluctuation across the entire sequence for the protease monomer compared\nwith the dimer, with functionally important sites like Ile50 showing\nstronger relative compaction.\n\nAnalyses of drug-bound compared with unbound proteases revealed several\nimportant trends. First of all, our results often captured asymmetric\nmovements between both chains of the protease homodimer, often\nreflecting the structural asymmetry caused by the ability of the\nprotease to dimerize on a variety of asymmetric small molecule\nsubstrates. Secondly, previous research has focused on expansion of the\nactive site as a mechanistic driver of resistance development ( 48 , 49\n) and has discovered the role of the substrate envelope in influencing\ndrug resistance ( 50 ). Our analyses indicate differential behavior\nbetween the individual chains of the homodimeric protease bound to both\nPIs studied, an experimental result seen previously for darunavir ( 51\n). In addition, we were able to observe in the case of both darunavir\nand lopinavir binding to drug-resistant proteases, a significant\nmalfunctional amplification of atom motion dynamics in the flap region\nof the drug/ligand binding pocket, consistent with the expansion of the\nactive site expected for these two multidrug-resistant examples. This\nmutational shift in dynamics is clearly indicative of a protease that\ncan much more easily release the inhibitory drug and perhaps continue to\nfunction normally in the interest of the virus. Very few studies have\nbeen able to tease out the more nuanced picture of resistance\ndevelopment that extends beyond the structurally implied \"expanded\npocket\" model. However, our comparative dynamics-based method adds much\nmore additional perspective indicating that the evolution of drug\nresistance is also generally accompanied by significant changes in the\nsoft matter biophysics of this region that may not be entirely related\nto expansion of the shape of the binding pocket but that still might\ncreate disruptive changes in response to competitive inhibition induced\nby current small molecule drugs.\n\nViral-host interactions are well known to drive adaptive evolution at\nthe protein level ( 52 , 53 ). This has been well documented by decades\nof work in comparative genomics. However, whereas comparative sequence\nanalyses can easily determine local signals of natural selection acting\non proteins (i.e., dN/dS type approaches), they have always been hard\npressed to determine what the functional drivers of this evolution are (\n54 , 55 ). We developed our methods largely in response to this \"black\nbox\" problem in molecular evolutionary studies. Function in molecular\nbiology is ultimately defined by both the structure and soft matter\ndynamics of proteins. Therefore, we have long conjectured that a proper\ncomparative approach to MD simulations conducted on well-defined\nfunctional states (e.g., bound versus unbound or WT versus mutant) can\nhelp provide this missing perspective to the functional evolution of\nmany protein systems. In this work, we have clearly demonstrated that\nadaptive evolution in the HIV-1 main protease in response to the\nselective pressures of drug therapy has subsequently driven a series of\ndirectional mutations that combine to alter the stability of the flap\nregion of the proteolytic binding pocket, thereby altering its ability\nto function. Our work also demonstrates that whereas this evolution is\ndirected, it can achieve similar destabilization of the biophysics in\nthis region regardless of the specific mutations and drug therapies\ninvolved. In summary, our overall findings suggest a common functional\nevolutionary route leading to most HIV drug resistance to competitive\nPIs. Future drug therapies that can avoid this rapid viral evolution may\nhave more lasting benefit during the lifespan of the patient.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 25552724\nQuestion ID: 1\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\nEvidence: \"Two resistance selection studies performed in our laboratory with the investigative drugs MK-2048 and S/GSK139572 (DTG) yielded the G118R mutation in subtype C ( 20 ) and CRF02_AG ( 16 ) integrases, respectively.

However, in Nanjing, China, there is still a dearth of\nresearch on the prevalence and transmission of TDR among ART-naïve\nHIV-1-infected individuals. This study aimed to understand the\nprevalence and transmission of TDR in Nanjing.\n\n### Methods\n\nA total of 1,393 participants who were newly diagnosed with HIV-1 and\nhad not received ART between January 2019 and December 2021 were\nenrolled in this study. HIV-1 *pol* gene sequence was obtained by viral\nRNA extraction and nested PCR amplification. Genotypes, TDR and\ntransmission cluster analyses were conducted using phylogenetic tree,\nStanford HIV database algorithm and HIV-TRACE, respectively. Univariate\nand multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify\nthe factors associated with TDR.\n\n### Results\n\nA total of 1,161 sequences were successfully sequenced, of which\nCRF07_BC (40.6%), CRF01_AE (38.4%) and CRF105_0107 (6.3%) were the main\nHIV-1 genotypes. The overall prevalence of TDR was 7.8%, with 2.0% to\nPIs, 1.0% to NRTIs, and 4.8% to NNRTIs. No sequence showed double-class\nresistance. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that\ncompared with CRF01_AE, subtype B (OR = 2.869, 95%CI: 1.093--7.420) and\nfemale (OR = 2.359, 95%CI: 1.182--4.707) were risk factors for TDR. Q58E\nwas the most prevalent detected protease inhibitor (PI) -associated\nmutation, and V179E was the most frequently detected non-nucleoside\nreverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) -associated mutation. A total of\n613 (52.8%) sequences were segregated into 137 clusters, ranging from 2\nto 74 sequences. Among 44 individuals with TDR (48.4%) within 21\nclusters, K103N/KN was the most frequent TDR-associated mutation\n(31.8%), followed by Q58E/QE (20.5%) and G190A (15.9%). Individuals with\nthe same TDR-associated mutations were usually cross-linked in\ntransmission clusters. Moreover, we identified 9 clusters in which there\nwas a transmission relationship between drug-resistant individuals, and\n4 clusters in which drug-resistant cases increased during the study\nperiod.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe overall prevalence of TDR in Nanjing was at a moderate level during\nthe past 3 years. However, nearly half of TDR individuals were included\nin the transmission clusters, and some drug-resistant individuals have\ntransmitted in the clusters. Therefore, HIV drug-resistance prevention,\nmonitoring and response efforts should be sustained and expanded to\nreduce the prevalence and transmission of TDR in Nanjing.\n\n\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Study subjects and data collection\n\nIn our study, 1, 393 ART-naïve individuals newly diagnosed with HIV-1\nwere enrolled between January 1, 2019 and November 31, 2021. Each\npatient met the following criteria: (1) Age ≥ 16 years; (2) Confirmed\ndiagnosis of HIV-1 infection; (3) No history of ART. Participants were\nenrolled at the voluntary counseling testing clinics (VCT) in Nanjing.\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nanjing Center for\nDisease Control and Prevention (Approval ID: PJ2020-A001-03). After the\nwritten informed consent obtained from each eligible participants,\nplasma samples were collected and basic epidemiological such as age,\ngender, marital status and self-reported transmission routes were\nrecorded upon enrollment.\n\n### RNA extraction, nested-PCR, and sequencing of viral DNA\n\nWithin 12 h after blood collection, plasma was isolated and kept at\n−80°C until analysis. Viral RNA was extracted from 200 μl plasma samples\nusing the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The\ntarget fragment of 1,059 bp in the pol gene (HXB2:2253--3,312) was\namplified using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PrimeScriptTM\nOne Step RT-PCR Ver. 2.0 (TakaRa, China) was used for the first-round\nPCR procedure and cDNA synthesis. Nested PCR was performed with Ex Taq\n(TaKaRa, China). The PCR products were sent to Sangon Biotechnology Co.,\nLtd. for automatic DNA sequencing using ABI 3730XL. The PCR protocol and\nprimers used were as previously described ( 21 ).\n\n### Subtype analysis\n\nSequencer 4.10.1 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, MI) was used for sequence\nsplicing, and the secondary peak threshold was set to 30% to identify\nambiguities. The sequence was aligned with the reference sequences using\nBioEdit (version 7.0.9, Informer Technologies Inc.). Reference sequences\nwere downloaded from the Los Alamos HIV database and included the major\ninternational epidemic strains A-D, F-H, and J-K, as well as the major\nepidemic recombinant strains in China. A phylogenetic tree with the\nmaximum likelihood (ML) method was constructed for confirmation using\nthe FastTree 2.1. The nucleotide substitution model was GTR + G + I, and\nsupport values were calculated by Shimodaira Hasegawa-like test.\nClusters with a bootstrap value higher than 0.90 (90%) were defined as\nthe same subtype. The ML phylogenetic tree was imported to FigTree v\n1.4.4 for visualization.\n\n### Drug resistance analysis\n\nWe assessed clinically relevant resistance to protease inhibitors (PIs),\nnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), or non-nucleoside\nreverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) using the Stanford University\nHIV Drug Resistance Database Genotypic Resistance Interpretation\nAlgorithm (version 8.8) and the International Antiviral Society Drug\nResistance Mutation list ( 12 ). The degree of drug resistance to each\nART drug was divided into five levels: susceptible (S, 0--9), potential\nlow resistance (PLR, 10--14), low-level resistance (LR, 15--29),\nintermediate-level resistance (IR, 30--59), and high-level resistance\ncategories (HR, ≥60). TDR was detected among ART-naïve individuals, and\nsequences classified as low-, intermediate-, or high-level resistance\nwere designated as drug resistance according to the WHO drug resistance\nreport ( 6 ).\n\n### Transmission clusters construction\n\nSequences \\<1,000 bp in length or containing ≥5% ambiguities were\nexcluded. HIV-TRACE (localized HIV-TRACE, built CentOS 7 platform, wrote\nprogram offline) was used to determine the optimal genetic distance\nthreshold and construct molecular network ( 22 ). With the optimal\nthreshold of 1.5% genetic distance, the HIV *pol* gene sequence was\ncompared with the reference sequence, and the genetic distances of\npaired genes were calculated using the Tamura-NEI 93 model to construct\nthe molecular network of TDR transmission ( 23 ). Cytoscape (version\n3.6.1) was used to process and generate the molecular network.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nSPSS (version 18.0, LEAD Technologies Inc.) was used for data analysis.\nQuantitative data were represented as means ± standard deviation or\nmedian (inter-quartile range, IQR). Categorical variable were\nrepresented as frequency and percentage, and analyzed using the\nchi-square test. Linear-by-linear chi-square tests were performed to\nanalyze the trend in TDR prevalence from 2019 to 2021. Univariate and\nmultivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the\nfactors associated with TDR. Variables with a *p* \\< 0.05 in univariate\nanalyses were included in stepwise multivariate regression analysis. All\nresults of statistical significance test were reported as *p* -values.\n*p \\<* 0.05 (two-tailed) was considered statistically significant.\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Demographic and social characteristics\n\nWe sequenced and analyzed 1,161 samples obtained from 1,393 HIV-1\ninfected individuals in our research. The median age was 29 years (IQR:\n24--43 years), raging from16 to 89 years. The majority of the\nparticipants were single (62.4%), while the Han majority accounted for\n97.9%. In terms of the education, 59.9% were college and higher, and\n22.1% were junior or below. The major transmission route was homosexual\ntransmission (68.9%), followed by heterosexual transmission (30.2%;\nTable 1 ).\n\n### Distribution of HIV-1 subtypes\n\nAmong the 1,161 successfully amplified sequences, circulating\nrecombinant form (CRF) 07_BC (40.6%) was the predominant subtype,\nfollowed by CRF01_AE (38.4%), CRF105_0107 (6.3%), CRF67_01B (3.2%),\nCRF55_01B (3.1%), subtype B (3.0%), CRF08_BC (2.2%) and CRF68_01B\n(2.1%). Additionally, another 13 (1.1%) HIV-1 strains did not cluster\nwith any present known reference sequences, and were determined as\nunique recombinant forms (URFs; Figure 1 ).\n\nFigure 1\n\nPhylogenetic tree analysis of nucleotide sequences from 1,161 newly\ndiagnosed individual. CRF, circulating recombinant form; URFs, unique\nrecombinant forms; PIs, protease inhibitors; NRTIs, nucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitors; NNRTIs, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors.\n\n### Prevalence of TDR and the factors associated with TDR\n\nThe overall prevalence of transmitted drug resistance was 7.8%\n(91/1161), including 2.0% (23/1161) to PIs, 1.0% (12/1161) to NRTIs, and\n4.8% (56/1161) to NNRTIs. All the HIV-1 strains with TDR displayed a\nsingle drug class resistance mutation. From 2019 to 2021, the prevalence\nof TDR was stable ( *χ* ^2^ = 0.016, *p =* 0.898), with annual rates of\n8.0, 7.8, and 7.8%, respectively. Univariate and multivariate logistic\nregression analyses showed that compared with CRF01_AE, infection with\nthe Subtype B (aOR = 2.847, 95%CI: 1.093--7.420) and female\n(aOR = 2.359, 95%CI: 1.182--4.707) were risk factors for TDR ( Table 1\n).\n\n### Analysis of HIV drug resistance mutation sites with subtype\n\nAmong the 91 drug-resistant individuals, we found 60 kinds of DRM; 24\nwere associated with resistance to NNRTIs, 14 to NRTIs, and 22 to PIs.\nIndividuals infected with CRF07_BC were most likely to develop\nPI-related mutations. Q58E (1.2%) were the most prevalent detected\nPI-associated mutation, and all harbored in CRF07_BC. Individuals\ninfected with CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC were most likely to develop\nNRTI-associated mutations. The mutation sites primarily comprised M41L\n(0.2%), M41ML (0.2%), K219E (0.2%) and T215TS (0.2%). Individuals\ninfected with CRF01_AE were most likely to develop NNTRI-associated\nmutations, followed by CRF07_BC; and V179E (4.9%), V179D (4.0%), V179T\n(2.2%) and K103N (2.0%) were the most common mutations. Most V179E\nmutations were detected in CRF55_01B, most V179D mutations were detected\nin CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC, and all the V179T mutations were detected in\nCRF01_AE ( Figure 2 ).\n\nFigure 2\n\nAnalysis of drug resistance mutation sites with different subtype.\n**(A)** Mutations associated with PIs resistance. **(B)** Mutations\nassociated with NRTIs resistance. **(C)** Mutations associated with\nNNRTIs resistance. PIs, protease inhibitors; NRTIs, nucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitors; NNRTIs, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors.\n\n### Level of resistance to different antiretroviral drugs\n\nThe HIV-1 resistance level to a total of 20 common antiretroviral drugs\nwas analyzed based on the drug resistant mutation score. PIs and NRTIs\nTDR present mostly low-level resistance. Moreover, NNRTI displayed\nmainly as intermediate-to high-level resistance, except for ETR and RPV,\nwhich exhibited primarily LR (8, 0.7% for ETR; 19, 1.6% for RPV; Table 2\n). For PIs, TPV showed high TDR frequency (1.6%) and the degree of\nresistance was all at LR (1.6%) As for NRTIs, D4T (0.9%) and AZT (0.8%)\npresented high TDR frequency and the degree of resistance was mainly at\nLR (0.6% for D4T, 0.7% for AZT). As for NNRTIs, NVP (4.3%) and EFV\n(4.0%) showed high TDR frequency and the degree of resistance was mainly\nat HR (3.3% for NVP, 2.6% for EFV). A total of 38 cases were high-level\nresistant to any one of NVP or EFV. In terms of the mutations sites\namong these 38 cases, K103N (60.5%, 23/38) was the most frequent\nTDR-associated mutation, followed by G190A (21.2%, 8/38).\n\n### Drug resistance-associated transmission cluster analysis\n\nWe constructed a HIV-1 transmission network using a total of 1,161\nsequences ( Figure 3 ). Under the optimal threshold of 1.5% genetic\ndistance, 613 (52.8%) sequences were segregated into 137 clusters in the\ntransmission network, ranging from 2 to 74 sequences. Of the sequences\nin the network, 40.8% (250/613) were CRF07_BC and 33.9% (208/613) were\nCRF01_AE. We found that 66.4% (407/613) occurred in homosexual\nindividuals and 32.3% (198/613) in heterosexual individuals. In the\nlargest cluster and the second largest cluster (consisting of 74\nindividuals and 46 individuals, respectively), MSM was the major route\nof transmission (71.6 and 89.1%, respectively; Figure 3A ).\n\nFigure 3\n\nDrug resistance within HIV-1 transmission clusters for different\ntransmission route **(A)** and different year **(B)** . PIs, protease\ninhibitors; NRTIs, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors; NNRTIs,\nnon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors; sensitive, sensitive to\nantiretroviral drugs.\n\nWe identified that 44 TDR cases (48.4%, 44/91) were included in 21\ntransmission clusters, of which 43.2% (19/44) were primarily\nconcentrated in 4 clusters. Among the 44 TDR cases, 12 cases had\nresistance to PIs, 4 to NRTIs and 28 to NNRTIs. The majority were male\n(84.1%), the major subtypes were CRF01_AE (34.1%), CRF07_BC (34.1%) and\nCRF105_0107 (15.9%), and the major transmission route was homosexual\ntransmission (61.4%). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression\nanalyses were used to explore the factors associated with TDR in the\ntransmission clusters. Female (aOR = 2.692; 95%CI: 1.112--6.521) and\nethnic minorities (aOR = 6.752; 95%CI: 1.601--28.475) were associated\nwith higher risk for TDR in clusters ( Table 3 ).\n\nWe observed 9 clusters containing interconnected TDR cases (7 clusters\nwith NNRTIs TDR transmission, and 2 clusters with PIs TDR transmission).\nFrom 2019 to 2021, we identified 4 clusters that increased in\ndrug-resistant cases during the study period. In addition, one cluster\nformed in 2019 containing 2 individuals with drug resistance has\nexpanded year by year. This cluster grew to contain 4 individuals in\n2020, and 6 in 2021, and all of them within this cluster harbored NNRTIs\ndrug resistance ( Figure 3B ).\n\nWe found that TDR cases were more likely linked to those with the same\nmutations. Among the 44 TDR cases in transmission clusters, K103N/KN was\nthe most frequent TDR-associated mutation (31.8%, 8 cases in two\nCRF01_AE clusters and 6 cases in a CRF105_0107 cluster), followed by\nQ58E/QE (20.5%, 9 cases in four CRF07_BC clusters) and G190A (15.9%, 3\ncases in two CRF01_AE clusters, 2 cases in a CRF55_01B cluster and 2\ncases in a CRF07_BC cluster). Additionally, 6 cases carried potential\nlow-level resistant mutations (V179D/E; Figure 4 ).\n\nFigure 4\n\nStatus of subtype and drug resistance mutations within HIV-1\ntransmission clusters.\n\n## Discussion\n\nOur study revealed that the major HIV-1 genotypes detected in Nanjing\nwere CRF07_BC, CRF01_AE and CRF105_01B. Our result was similar to those\nof the study conducted in Zhejiang province (close neighbor of Jiangsu)\nand 30 provinces of China ( 24 , 25 ). In the past 20 years, the\ndistribution of HIV-1 genotypes in Jiangsu Province has undergone\nchanges. During 2000--2001, the predominant subtypes were B′ and C, but\nthey have been replaced by CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC in recent years,\nmeanwhile more URFs produced ( 26 , 27 ). In this study, the\ndistribution of HIV-1 genotype in Nanjing also changed over time. Since\nthe first detection of a cluster of novel CRF105_0107 HIV-1 strains\namong MSM in Nanjing in 2017, the prevalence of CRF105_0107 has risen to\n6.3% ( 28 ), indicating rapid transmission of CRF105_0107 among the\npopulation. The proportion of infection with CRF01_AE declined\ngradually, while that with CRF07_BC increased gradually. The predominant\ngenotype has changed from CRF01_AE in the period of 2015--2019 to\nCRF07_BC in the study period ( 29 ). A series of surveys in various\nprovinces have shown the essential role of CRF07_BC in HIV-1\ntransmission among MSM ( 30 , 31 ). CRF07_BC strains were frequently\ndetected in MSM in some parts of China, and its proportion among MSM in\nFujian and Guangdong showed an increasing trend in recent years ( 17 ,\n31 , 32 ). The dominance of CRF07_BC is likely to be maintained if HIV\nspread rapidly among MSM. Therefore, our study highlighted the\nimportance of CRF07_BC and CRF105_0107 in HIV control in Nanjing. In\naddition, we observed some unconfirmed unique recombinant strains,\nsuggesting that the changes and complexity of the distribution of HIV-1\ngenotype has posed a great challenge for HIV prevention and control in\nNanjing.\n\nThe overall prevalence of TDR in Nanjing was at the moderate level\naccording to the categorization method of WHO ( 33 ). The prevalence\nremained stable during 2019--2021, and higher than the average level of\nJiangsu Province during 2009--2011 (3.2%) ( 27 ), as well as some\nregions of China, such as Beijing and Guangdong ( 17 , 34 ). Besides, it\nwas almost twice the level (4.02%) of a local survey conducted during\n2015--2019 ( 29 ). The increase in TDR will affect the antiretroviral\ntherapy and the spread of drug resistance. Therefore, we should carry\nout in-depth investigation and analysis on the causes of TDR increase\nfrom the aspects of drug compliance, late diagnosis, mobility of\nhigh-risk groups, etc. Meanwhile, we should strengthen the surveillance\nof TDR and develop strategy to curb the TDR, such as customized ART\nprescription based on drug resistance prior to ART. Of the 5 main\nsubtypes, the risk of TDR was almost 3 times greater for subtype B than\nfor CRF01_AE, which was consistent with previous results ( 35 , 36 ).\nAccording to a study of 579 cases with ART failure in Jiangsu Province,\npatients with subtype B infection were associated with higher incidence\nof drug resistance compared with those infected with CRF07_BC ( 37 ),\nindicating that patients with drug resistance due to ART failure may\ntransmit their own drug resistant strains to the newly infected\nindividuals. The level of TDR in the subtype B was far above the\nthreshold of the high prevalence level of 10%, therefore, non-first-line\nregimen, such as integrase inhibitors, could be considered among this\npopulation.\n\nWe found a significantly higher prevalence of mutations related to NNRTI\nresistance than PIs or NRTIs resistance. The accelerated development and\nspread of resistance to NNRTIs is not surprising given the strong\nselection pressures caused by the long-term use of a limited number of\nNNRTI drugs ( 38 ). The distribution of mutation sites was complex. The\nmost common DRMs were V179E and V179D for NNRTIs; M41L and M41ML for\nNRTIs; Q58E and L33F for PIs. Previous study has shown that in CRF01\\_\nAE, the potential drug resistance mutations V179D/E can synergistically\ninteract with some polymorphic sites, ultimately leading to the\ntransmission of this mutation site in untreated patients ( 39 ). As to\ngenotypes, most V179E mutations were detected in CRF55_01B, which was\nconsistent with the research in Guangzhou and Southwest China ( 13 , 40\n). Therefore, it is speculated that the V179E mutation may be a\npolymorphism site of CRF55_01B. In China, the combinatorial therapy with\nTDF/AZT + 3TC + EFV/NVP has been prescribed as the first-line ART\nregimen because of the limited availability of drugs. Of note, the TDR\nprevalence of EFV and NVP, the common two kinds of NNRTI drugs, reached\n4%. Moreover, the above two drugs mainly exhibited high-level\nresistance. In this study, the high-level resistance to EFV and NVP\nprimarily resulted from the mutations K103N, which was similar to\nprevious research ( 41 ). These findings highlight the importance of\nidentifying HIV-1 resistance patterns at diagnosis or baseline to guide\nappropriate choice of antiviral therapy. At present, antiretroviral\ntherapy is free in China, but drug resistance testing is expensive and\ndifficult for patients to afford. Therefore, we hope that the government\ncan introduce policies, such as reducing or subsidizing a portion of the\ntesting fee, or making the testing fee covered by medical insurance.\n\nOf the transmission clusters constructed based on obtained HIV-1\nsequences, more than three-quarters of the largest two clusters were\ncomprised of sequences from MSM. Nearly half of the individuals infected\nwith drug resistant strains were included in 21 clusters, in which\nnearly two-thirds of drug resistance was associated with homosexuality.\nThese results illustrated that MSM may contribute essentially to the\nspread of HIV in Nanjing, and more efforts should be paid to this group.\nAdditionally, the drug-resistant individuals shared a transmission\nrelationship, and the drug-resistant individuals within 4 transmission\nclusters has increased over time, indicating that the spread of drug\nresistant strains has occurred in the transmission network, and similar\nresults have been observed in some regions of China ( 13 , 25 , 42 ). In\nterms of TDR-associated mutations in transmission clusters, K103N/KN and\nQ58E/QE were the most frequent TDR-associated mutations. They were\nmainly in 3 clusters and 2 clusters, respectively, in which they linked\nwith those carrying the same mutations. The above two mutations may have\nbeen transmitted for a period and spreading onward in the community.\nLogistic regression analysis revealed that female, ethnic minorities may\nbe related to higher risk for TDR in transmission clusters. The female\ncases in the clusters were mainly infected by their positive\nspouse/fixed sexual partner. They may have more chance of TDR if their\npositive spouse or fixed partner carry transmission drug-resistant\nmutations themselves or have acquired drug resistance due to failure of\nART. The association of these parameters with TDR transmission should be\nfurther investigated and taken into considered when implementing\nsubsequent network-based interventions. Therefore, the transmission\npattern of TDR should be monitored routinely and in-depth, and later\nnetwork-based intervention should focused on the drug-resistant\nindividuals or specific clusters, such as clusters of TDR transmission,\nor clusters of drug resistant individuals that increase over time.\n\nOur study has several limitations. First, there might be selection bias\nbecause the newly diagnosed HIV individuals who did not sign the consent\nform were not enrolled in our study. Second, participants newly\ndiagnosed with HIV-1 infection enrolled in the study were not newly\ninfected. They may have been infected for a considerable period of time,\nand the non-resistant strains become the dominant strains in the\npatients ( 43 ), making it impossible to detect drug resistance\nmutations. Third, our analysis of TDR only concentrated on NRTIs, NNRTIs\nand PIs, while integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) were not\nincluded, which became an important part of ART. Recent studies have\nrevealed that despite the low prevalence of INSTI resistance in\nART-naive patients in some domestic areas, INSTI resistance has been\nobserved in INSTI-treated patients ( 44 , 45 ). INSTI resistance\nmonitoring should be considered because prescriptions for INSTI-based\nregimen are anticipated to increase substantially in the near future.\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, this study of 1,161 ART-naïve HIV-1 patients showed diverse\nand complex distribution of HIV-1 genotypes and mutation site in\nNanjing, with CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC as the predominant genotypes. We\nillustrated that the overall prevalence of TDR was at a moderate level\nover 3 years. However, nearly half of individuals with TDR were included\nin transmission clusters, and some drug-resistant individuals have\ntransmitted in clusters. Therefore, HIV drug resistance prevention,\nmonitoring and response efforts should be sustained to reduce the\nprevalence and transmission of TDR in Nanjing.\n\n\n\n## Data availability statement\n\nThe authors acknowledge that the data presented in this study must be\ndeposited and made publicly available in an acceptable repository, prior\nto publication.

We determined the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity in Bulgaria during 2012--2020 using polymerase sequences from 1053 of 2010 (52.4%) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. Sequences were analyzed for DRM using the WHO HIV SDRM list implemented in the calculated population resistance tool at Stanford University. Genetic diversity was inferred using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetics. Cluster detection and characterization was performed using MicrobeTrace. The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%). Most (34/60, 56.7%) of the SDRMs were present in transmission clusters of different subtypes composed mostly of male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC), including a 14-member cluster of subtype B sequences from 12 MMSC and two males reporting heterosexual contact; 13 had the L90M PI mutation and one had the T215S NRTI SDRM. We found a low SDRM prevalence amid high HIV-1 diversity among ART-naive patients in Bulgaria during 2012--2020. The majority of SDRMs were found in transmission clusters containing MMSC, indicative of onward spread of SDRM in drug-naive individuals. Our study provides valuable information on the transmission dynamics of HIV drug resistance in the context of high genetic diversity in Bulgaria, for the development of enhanced prevention strategies to end the epidemic.\n\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity using sequences from ART-naive individuals.

Subtype determination and drug resistance scoring were performed using the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database. Trends over time were assessed using linear regression, and the maximum likelihood approach was used for phylogenetic analysis.\nResults. A total of 17.9% of the patients showed evidence of TDR resulting in at least low-level resistance to 1 drug (Stanford score ≥15). If only the high-level mutations (Stanford score ≥60) were considered, TDR prevalence dropped to 6.3%. The majority of observed resistance mutations impacted the sensitivity for nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (11.4%), followed by nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (6.2%) and protease inhibitors (2.4%). Multiclass resistance was observed in 2.4%.

Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

HIV Pretreatment DR (PDR) and drug resistance mutation (DRM) prevalence was estimated using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database. The PDR level was interpreted according to the WHO standard PDR survey protocols. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database and subsequently confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Transmission clusters were determined using Cluster Picker.\nResults\nAnalyses of HIV subtypes showed that EECA, in general, has the same HIV genetic variants of sub-subtype A6, CRF63_02A1, and subtype B, with different frequencies and representation for each country.\nThe prevalence of PDR to any drug class was 2.8% in Uzbekistan, 4.2% in Azerbaijan, 4.5% in Russia, 9.2% in Armenia, 13.9% in Belarus, and 16.7% in Tajikistan. PDR to protease inhibitors (PIs) was not detected in any country. PDR to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) was not detected among patients in Azerbaijan, and was relatively low in other countries, with the highest prevalence in Tajikistan (5.6%). The prevalence of PDR to nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was the lowest in Uzbekistan (2.8%) and reached 11.1% and 11.4% in Tajikistan and Belarus, respectively.\nGenetic transmission network analyses identified 226/1071 (21.1%) linked individuals, forming 93 transmission clusters mainly containing two or three sequences. We found that the time since HIV diagnosis in clustered patients was significantly shorter than that in unclustered patients (1.26 years vs 2.74 years). Additionally, the K103N/S mutation was mainly observed in clustered sequences (6.2% vs 2.8%).\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance and the genetic analysis of HIV-1 sequences from patient samples.

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals. This retrospective study examines genetic sequences and clinical parameters like CD4+ T cell counts and viral load to understand the epidemiological and genetic characteristics of HIV-1 in the pediatric population in Rio de Janeiro.\nAnswer: No"}

B/F/TAF has been tested in\nobservational or uncontrolled pilot studies (OPERA, RAINBOW), while a\nlarge randomized controlled trial is currently ongoing (LAPTOP).\n\nIn conclusion, B/F/TAF is an ideal combination for the initiation of\nantiretroviral therapy, particularly in the HIV late presenter or\nadvanced HIV disease patient, even in the context of rapid start or\nsame-day treatment regimens, where the initiation of treatment usually\noccurs in the absence of information on viral load, CD4 count,\nbiochemical profile and HIV transmitted resistance.\n\n**Keywords:** Bictegravir, Emtricitabile, Tenofovir, PLWH\n\n\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nLate HIV diagnosis was associated with adverse outcomes, increased risk\nof HIV transmission, and high healthcare costs. A 2010 consensus\nstatement defined late HIV presentation as a presentation to care with a\nCD4 count \\<350 cells/μL or an AIDS-defining event. This definition has\nbeen used across Europe for clinical research and public health\nmonitoring for over 10 years. Radical changes have recently been\nobserved regarding the best time to start antiretroviral therapy (ART),\nin a model of an universal approach to starting therapy. CD4 cell count\nat the time of ART initiation has been shown to be directly related to\nthe extent of CD4 recovery and life expectancy. It is noteworthy that,\ndespite these main improvements, the proportion of people with advanced\nHIV disease still remains a major challenge.\n\nDifferently from late presentation (CD4 count less than 350 cells/mm ^3^\nor AIDS-defining event), WHO has defined advanced HIV disease for adults\nas CD4 cell count \\<200 cells/mm ^3^ or WHO stage 3 or 4 events. Up to\n20% of individuals newly diagnosed with HIV in the US have advanced HIV\ninfection (CD4\\<200 cells/μL), whereas an advanced HIV infection was\nobserved in 35% of new HIV diagnoses in Europe (9% with AIDS\npresentation) and in 40% of new HIV diagnoses in Italy in 2022. Advanced\nHIV naïve represents an unfavorable prognostic condition due to a\npersistent high risk of death, increased probability of virological\nfailure, immunologic impairment, clinical progression, and immune\nreconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Advanced HIV status for\nnaïve individuals was also related to cumulative adverse drug events and\ndrug-drug interactions and is associated with increased healthcare\ncosts. According to observational study data, male gender, advanced age,\nmigrant status, heterosexual intercourse, or injecting drug users (IDUs)\nas a mode of transmission are all factors commonly associated with late\npresentation and with advanced HIV disease.\n\nCurrently, all international guidelines (DHHS, WHO, IAS-USA, EACS)\nrecommend the rapid initiation of ART, especially in late-stage naïve\npatients. The strategy of rapid ART initiation was supported by the\nevidence from randomized trials performed in resource-limited settings,\nin which all stages of HIV infection were evaluated. A meta-analysis\nconducted by Ford et al. in low-income countries, including four\nrandomized trials, demonstrated that rapid initiation of ART (within 14\ndays), even in patients with advanced HIV, is superior to standard of\ncare in terms of probability of ART initiation, patient retention in\ncare, viral suppression, rate of AIDS progression/death and risk of HIV\nspread in the population by ongoing viral transmission. Furthermore, a\nmulticentre randomized clinical trial conducted in participants with\nAIDS presentation in the US and South Africa demonstrated the\nsuperiority of early ART (within 14 days of initiation of treatment of\nacute opportunistic infection) with no increase in adverse events or\nloss of virological response compared to delayed ART. Unfortunately,\nthese data are not generalizable to a different social context, which\nremains an important limitation of this rate of evidence. In high-income\ncountries, data on rapid ART strategies in advanced HIV naïve people are\nmostly derived from retrospective observational studies, such as those\nled in the city of San Francisco. However, it must be considered that\nrapid initiation means starting ART before the results of many\nlaboratory tests are available, which may limit the choice of ART.\n\nIntegrase inhibitors (INSTIs), co-administered with two nucleosides\nreverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), are recommended as first-line\ntreatment for HIV by international guidelines \\[DHHS, IAS-USA, EACS\\].\nBictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF), due to its\nefficacy high genetic barrier, good safety profile, and low DDI\npotential, is one of the regimens recommended for overall rapid\ninitiation by international guidelines. Despite the evidence on the use\nof B/F/TAF as a rapid start strategy, scientific evidence on the rapid\ninitiation of antiretroviral therapy with B/F/TAF in the advanced HIV\npatient is still limited. A recent study showed that, in ART-naïve\npatients with advanced disease who started on B/F/TAF, the incidence\nrate of regimen discontinuation was lower compared to boosted regimens\nbased on darunavir (DRV/b), dolutegravir (DTG) and\nelvitegravir/cobicistat (EVG/c).\n\n### The OPERA cohort\n\nIn the OPERA cohort, all ART-naïve adults with advanced HIV (CD4\\<200\ncells/μL) starting a three-drug regimen of\nbictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) or a\nthree-drug regimen of boosted darunavir (bDRV), dolutegravir (DTG) or\nelvitegravir/cobicistat (EVG/c) were selected. A Cox proportional\nhazards model was used to estimate the time required to reach a CD4 cell\ncount ≥200 cells/μL. A linear mixed model was used to assess changes in\nthe CD4/CD8 ratio from baseline. Inverse probability weighting was used\nto control for confounding factors ( Figure 1 ). Association between\nregimen and a) attainment of a CD4 cell count ≥200 cells/μ3, or b)\nchanges in CD4:CD8 ratio was investigated. Analyzing the results of the\nOPERA Study, among the 1,349 individuals included, those starting\nB/F/TAF were less likely to have a history of AIDS-defining disease, any\ncomorbidities, or ADAP/Ryan White coverage. Compared to those starting\nB/F/TAF, a statistically lower probability of achieving a CD4 cell count\n≥200 cells/μL was observed with bDRV (HR 0.76; 95%CI 0.60--0.96), DTG\n(HR 0.82; 95%CI 0.69--0.98) and EVG/c (HR 0.73; 95%CI 0.57--0.93) (\nFigure 1A ). All groups presented a similar pattern of changes in the\nCD4/CD8 ratio: a rapid increase in the first 6 months, followed by a\nslower increase thereafter ( Figure 1B ). Overall, only 40 individuals\n(4%) achieved a normalization of the CD4/CD8 ratio (expressed as a value\n≥1). The Authors concluded that among individuals with advanced HIV\ninfection, B/F/TAF initiation was associated with a faster CD4 cell\ncount recovery (\\>200 cells/μL). No difference was observed in CD4:CD8\nratio changes over time across groups. Moreover, a CD4:CD8 ratio\nnormalization was rare with all regimens.\n\nFigure 1\n\nAssociation between regimen and (A) reaching a CD4 cell count ≥200\ncells/μ3, or (B) changes in CD4/CD8 ratio from index.

Rainbow was a\npilot, single-center, single-arm, prospective, phase IV, clinical trial\nconducted in a tertiary care Italian hospital from the 1 ^st^ of May\n2020 to the 31 ^st^ of December 2021. 30 ART-naive participants ( Table\n1 ), presenting at HIV-1 diagnosis with an advanced disease, described\nas the presence of an AIDS-defining condition and/or CD4 cell count\n\\<200 cells/μL, were enrolled in the study. Exclusion criteria were:\nCrCl \\<30 mL/min, severe hepatic impairment, active tuberculosis (TB),\ncryptococcosis, pregnancy or breastfeeding, and systemic cancer\nchemotherapy. Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF)\n50/200/25 mg in a single-tablet was started within 7 days of HIV\ndiagnosis. The primary endpoint was a time-to-clinical or virologic\nfailure (VF) (ITT analysis). Safety and feasibility were also assessed.\n\n### Table 1\n\nBaseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the 30 patients\nenrolled in the Rainbow Study (modified from Camici M, et al. 24 ^th^\nInternational AIDS Conference - AIDS 2022; Abst.#EPB151).\n\n*Characteristic*\n\n*N = 30*\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFemale sex, n (%)\n\n5 (17)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAge, years, median (IQR)\n\n45 (38--58)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSexual orientation, n (%)\n\nMSM\n\n5 (17)\n\nHeterosexual\n\n10 (33)\n\nOther/unknown\n\n15 (50)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRace (White), n (%)\n\n27 (90)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCDC disease Stage C, n (%)\n\n13 (43)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD4 cell count, cell/mm ^3^ , median (IQR)\n\n90 (39--147)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD4/CD8 cell count, cell/mm ^3^ , median (IQR)\n\n0.14 (0.09--0.24)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHIV RNA at BL, log ~10~ c/mL, median (IQR)\n\n6.0 (5.4--6.4)\n\nOpen in a separate window\n\nA total of 30 patients ( Table 1 ) were enrolled: 16% female, 90% white,\nmedian age 45 years (38--58), 43% had CDC stage disease C, CD4 cell\ncount was 90 cells/μL (39--147), HIV RNA log ~10~ cp/ml 6.0 (5.4--6.4),\n40% of patients had ≥1 comorbidity. The proportion of patients with HIV\nRNA \\<50 cp/mL increased from 9/30 (30%) at week 4 to 27/30 (90%) at\nweek 48 ( Figure 2 ). No viral rebound was observed. The proportion with\nCD4 \\>200 cells/μL increased from 2/30 (7%) at BL to 24/30 (80%) at week\n48. HIV-DNA decreared, CD4/CD8 improved, BMI increased,while eGFR\ndecreased slightly ( Figure 3 ). There were no ART interruptions due to\ntoxicity or VF. Three participants had 6 SAEs (4 unrelated; 2\npotentially related) to B/F/TAF: one had seizures (week 4 and week 12) +\nPML with IRIS (week 5), two had pneumocystis pneumonia with IRIS (week\n4) + pneumomediastinum (week 5); three had clinical worsening (week 1) +\nacute appendicitis and disseminated TB with IRIS (week 2) which required\nswitch to different ART. There were no changes in ART based on\nexamination of the baseline genotype (no NRTI mutations, only 3\naccessory INSTI mutations \\[E157Q, G163K, L74I\\]; no INSTI major\nmutations).\n\nFigure 2\n\nRates of Virologic Suppression and CD4 Count \\>200 Cells/μL in the\nRainbow Study (modified from Camici M, et al. 24 ^th^ International AIDS\nConference - AIDS 2022; Abst.#EPB151).\n\nFigure 3\n\nViral decay, immunological results, and eGFR average trend for 48 weeks\nin the Rainbow Study (modified from Camici M, et al. 24 ^th^\nInternational AIDS Conference - AIDS 2022; Abst.#EPB151).\n\nThe Rainbow study is the first ART rapid treatment clinical trial\nfocused on an advanced HIV population in a real-world clinical setting.\nThe results support the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of a rapid\nstart strategy with B/F/TAF in patients with advanced HIV. Moreover,\n30/40 of the patients diagnosed with advanced HIV infection met the\neligibility criteria and were enrolled in the study, and this\nobservation supports the feasibility of the rapid ART strategy even in\nsuch a challenging scenario. It was notework that, the study was\nperformed during the COVID-19 pandemic, when hospitals were\nsignificantly overburdened and health services were extensively involved\nin the management of COVID-19. Efficacy analysis showed high\neffectiveness of rapid ART with B/F/TAF with rapid viral decay and 90%\nviral efficacy at week 48. When using a rapid initiation strategy,\ninformation on transmitted HIV resistance, renal function, and HBV\ncoinfection may not be available before therapy starting. Given the safe\nrenal profile, high potency and genetic barrier, and activity against\nHBV, B/F/TAF could be considered an attractive option in a rapid onset\nstrategy setting.\n\n### The LAPTOP Study\n\nThe main aim of the LAPTOP study is to compare two different types of\nantiretroviral treatment, in terms of efficacy and improvement in side\neffects, for patients diagnosed with advanced HIV infection. This is the\nfirst large randomized controlled trial comparing treatments for\npatients in this situation. The two different types of treatment are the\nenhanced protease inhibitor (PI) combination, in the form of combination\ntablets containing darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir\nalafenamide, and the integrase inhibitor (INI) combination containing\nbictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide. Both drug\ncombinations have been approved for use in Europe. To compare the two\ntreatments, half of the participants in the LAPTOP study will receive\nthe PI treatment and the other half the INI treatment. A total of 440\nparticipants will be recruited from sites across Europe and randomized\nin an open-label design to one of the two arms of the study. After\nrandomization to one of the two treatment regimens, patients will\nparticipate in approximately 9 follow-up visits over the course of one\nyear. They will be asked to provide blood samples, to ensure viral\nefficacy and eventually selected drug-resistance mutations during\ntreatment. During the study, patients will be also asked to complete\nquestionnaires to assess their quality of life and HIV symptoms. The\nLAPTOP Study is currently still ongoing and the results were not yet\navailable.\n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nAlthough there is still limited evidence on the use of specific\nantiretroviral regimens in HIV late presenter or advanced disease\npatients, the B/F/TAF-containing combination has been tested in\nobservational or uncontrolled pilot studies, while a large randomized\ncontrolled trial is currently ongoing. The characteristics of high\npotency, high genetic barrier, high safety, and low level of\npharmacological interactions make this combination an ideal profile for\nthe initiation of antiretroviral therapy in the HIV late presenter or\nadvanced HIV disease patient, even in the context of rapid start or\nsame-day treatment regimens, where the initiation of treatment usually\noccurs in the absence of information on viral load, CD4 count,\nbiochemical profile and HIV transmitted resistance.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 25970253\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Longitudinal trends of recent HIV-1 infections in Slovenia (1986--2012) determined using an incidence algorithm\nAbstract\nResolving dilemma whether the rise in the number of HIV diagnoses represents an actual increase in HIV transmissions or is a result of improved HIV surveillance is crucial before implementing national HIV prevention strategies. Annual proportions of recent infections (RI) among newly diagnosed persons infected with HIV-1 in Slovenia during 27 years (1986--2012) were determined using an algorithm consisting of routine baseline CD4 and HIV viral load measurements and the Aware BED EIA HIV-1 Incidence Test (BED test). The study included the highest coverage of persons diagnosed with HIV during the entire duration of an HIV epidemic in a given country/region (71%). Out of 416 patients, 170 (40.9%) had a baseline CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/mm ^3^ and/or HIV-1 viral load less than 400 copies/ml and were characterized as having a long-standing infection (LSI). The remaining 246 patients were additionally tested using the BED test. Overall, 23% (97/416) of the patients were labeled RI. The characteristics significantly associated with RI were as follows: younger age, acute retroviral syndrome, CDC class A and other than C, no AIDS defining illnesses, HIV test performed in the past, a higher viral load, and a higher CD4 cell count. An interesting trend in the proportion of RI was observed, with a peak in 2005 (47% of RI) and the lowest point in 2008 (12%) in parallel with a rise in the numbers of new HIV diagnoses. This study could help promote the idea of introducing periodic HIV incidence monitoring using a simple and affordable algorithm. J. Med.

All these centres provide medical consultations and ARV supplies free of charge to patients, except for biological monitoring. Therefore, due to the lack of virological and immunological monitoring in these regions (no viral load or CD4 count), the selection concerned only patients with clinical failure according to the WHO recommendations. Clinical and sociodemographic data were obtained from record centres. All patients were previously diagnosed with HIV-1 using the national testing algorithm, which included two rapid assays, and were all ART-experienced.\nRationale: The paper does not mention that the patients were part of a clinical trial.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 36016383\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be transmitted via parenteral, sexual, or vertical exposure routes. The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals.

TAF is currently in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Phase 1 and 2 studies have shown that TAF was associated with increased peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) drug loading and increased suppression of HIV-1 replication compared to treatment with TDF. In this study, selection of in vitro resistance to both TAF and the parent compound, TFV, led to the emergence of HIV-1 with the K65R amino acid substitution in RT with 6.5-fold-reduced susceptibility to TAF. Although TAF is more potent than TFV in vitro, the antiviral susceptibilities to TAF and TFV of a large panel of nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant mutants were highly correlated (R2 = 0.97), indicating that the two compounds have virtually the same resistance profile when assessed as fold change from the wild type. TAF showed full antiviral activity in PBMCs against primary HIV-1 isolates with protease inhibitor, nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), or integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance but reduced activity against isolates with extensive NRTI resistance amino acid substitutions. However, the increased cell loading of TFV with TAF versus TDF observed in vivo suggests that TAF may retain activity against TDF-resistant mutant viruses.\nRationale: The paper describes the resistance selection experiments conducted with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and tenofovir (TFV). The study used a dose escalation method and analyzed genotypic and phenotypic changes in the virus over time.\nAnswer: Yes"}

Global efforts in addressing HIVDR require\nclear, transparent, and replicable reporting of HIVDR studies. We\ndescribe the rationale and recommended use of a checklist of items that\nshould be included in reports of HIVDR incidence or prevalence. After\npreliminary consultations with experts and establishing the need for\nguidance, we used a sequential explanatory mixed methods approach to\ncreate the checklist. The checklist and accompanying articles were\nreviewed by the writing team and validated externally. The Checklist for\nstudies of HIV Drug Resistance prevalence or incidence (CEDRIC-HIV)\nincludes 15 recommended items that would enhance transparency and\nfacilitate interpretation, comparability, and replicability of HIVDR\nstudies. CEDRIC-HIV will help authors of HIVDR studies prepare research\nreports and help reviewers and editors to assess completeness of\nreporting. It will also assist statistical pooling and interpretation of\nHIVDR data.\n\n## Development of the checklist:\n\nWe used the guidance proposed for developers of reporting guidelines\nwhich outline 18 steps in five phases: an initial preparatory phase\n(identifying the need for guidance and literature review); pre-meeting\nplanning; a face-to-face (or virtual) consensus meeting; post meeting\nactivities; and post-publication activities. ^10^ In brief, we\nestablished the need for guidelines based on a systematic review of the\nprevalence of HIV drug resistance in key populations, ^8^ and a\nsubsequent methodological study highlighting important gaps in\nreporting. ^9^ We used a mixed methods sequential explanatory approach\nwith two phases. The protocol for this mixed methods study is published\nelsewhere. ^11^ This checklist was registered on the Enhancing the\nQUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) network website on\nthe 22 September 2020.\n\nIn the first phase, we generated a list of participants from the\nauthorship lists of articles included in the methodological review and\ncollected data from 51 authors. In this survey, twenty-three (23) items\nwere proposed, and participants were allowed to propose additional\nitems. We asked responders to declare if an item was 'essential',\n'useful but not essential', or 'not necessary'. A validity ratio was\ncomputed to determine the items that at least 50% of the participants\nthought were essential. ^12^ The \"essential\" items and the newly\nproposed items were compiled into a list for discussion.\n\nIn the second phase we conducted two focus group discussions.\nParticipants were presented with the lists of items and requested to\ndiscuss the importance of reporting these items, whether they should be\nreported and why. The results of these discussions were compiled into a\nreporting checklist and rationale which is reported here. Full details\nof the mixed methods study will be reported separately and are under\nreview.\n\nThe items on the checklist were reviewed and refined for clarity by the\nwriting team which includes the participants of the focus group and\ninvited content experts. This document and the checklist were also\nreviewed by external parties including patient representatives.\n\n\n\n## Scope of intended use:\n\nThe archetypical study design for prevalence or incidence would be a\ncross-sectional observational study. ^13^ However, prevalence and\nincidence data may be generated from both observational (cross sectional\nor longitudinal) and experimental studies. ^13^ This reporting checklist\nis meant to support transparent and replicable reporting of HIV drug\nresistance data from any study design. As such it was not developed as\nan extension to any of the popular design-based reporting guidelines\nlike STROBE or CONSORT, ^14\\ ,\\ 15^ but rather as a topic-based\nreporting guideline, similar to STARD (Standards for Reporting of\nDiagnostic Accuracy Studies) ^16^ or REMARK (REporting recommendations\nfor tumour MARKer prognostic studies). ^17^\n\nThese guidelines are not meant to inform the design or implementation of\nresearch and are not intended to be prescriptive. The goal, as with all\nreporting guidelines, is that what was done is presented clearly and in\na manner that can inform replication, comparisons, and pooling of data.\nThese guidelines can be used by individual researchers or by\nlocoregional programs alongside the WHO HIVDR surveillance guidance.\n^18^\n\nWhile there is immense value in data sharing and collaboration across\ninstitutions and regions, there is also a potential for harm. For\nexample, phylogenetic analyses can lead to potential identification of\nHIV transmission between individuals and aggravate stigma and\nmarginalization of certain groups, if their characteristics accompany\nthe analyses. ^19^ Ethical, legal and safe approaches to generating and\nusing phylogenetic data are beyond the scope of this paper, but we\nadvise that authors should carefully consider the wording used and level\nof granularity reported on transmission clusters. ^19^\n\n\n\n## How to use this paper:\n\nBelow we provide a list of recommended reporting items. A brief\nexplanation is followed by an example drawn from a paper in which the\nitem was reported. In some instances, more than one example is shown.\nThe choice of articles from which the examples were drawn is arbitrary\nand does not imply that the paper reported all the items on the\nchecklist.\n\n\n\n## CEDRIC-HIV:\n\nThe Checklist for studies of Drug Resistance in HIV (CEDRIC-HIV)\nprevalence or incidence includes 15 reporting items to be addressed in\nthe title, introduction , methods , results , and discussion sections of\nthe paper ( Appendix ). Additional items that could be reported where\nrelevant are also listed. We have provided a description of the\nreporting items below with a rationale and examples.\n\n### Title\n\n1.\nThe title of the paper should identify the report as a study of HIV\ndrug resistance if that is the primary goal, and provide details on\nthe population, the type of drug resistance and the location of the\nstudy. This information will help to properly index and subsequently\nidentify the study. ^20^\n\nExample: In this study, the authors clearly outline the type of drug\nresistance, the population included in the study and the location of\nthe study: \"Transmitted drug resistance in recently infected\nHIV-positive Individuals from four urban locations across Asia\n(2007--2010) -- TASER-S\" ^21^\n\nExample: In this study the authors outline the type of drug\nresistance, the population, and the location of the study:\n\"Transmitted Antiretroviral Drug Resistance Among Drug-Naive Female\nSex Workers With Recent Infection in Kampala, Uganda\" ^22^\n\n### Introduction\n\n-\n2\\)\n\nIn the introduction, authors should provide contextual information\nthat will facilitate interpretation of the results. For example, the\nARV drug classes (or regimens) commonly used in the region the study\nwas conducted, previous studies of HIVDR in that population and any\nrelevant changes over time.\n\nExample: In this study, in the introduction section, the authors\ndescribe the type of ART used: \"Following World Health Organization\n(WHO) guidelines, a standard regimen consisting of 2 nucleoside\nreverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a non-NRTI (NNRTI) has\nbeen rolled out as initial cART\"; and other contextual information:\n\"The prevalence of HIV in Aruba is estimated at 0.5%\"; \"HIV\ntreatment is free for all individuals legally registered in Aruba.\"\n^23^\n\n### Methods\n\n-\n3\\)\n\nStudy design\n\nAuthors should report the study design, so that it is clear whether\ndata were collected at one point in time or over a period. Authors\nshould also report on the ethics approvals and waivers, and whether\nparticipants gave consent for their data to be used beyond the\npurposes of the published study.\n\nExample: In this study the authors described the design of the\nstudy: \"This cross-sectional study formed part of a larger project\naimed at understanding the complex interplay of factors associated\nwith HIV infection for FSWs (Female Sex Workers) in Soweto\"; ethics\napprovals: \"Ethical approval was provided by the Human Research\nEthics Committee (Medical) of the University of the Witwatersrand,\nSouth Africa\"; and participant consent:\" After screening,\nparticipants gave their consent to participate in the study.\" ^24^\n\n-\n4\\)\n\nSetting:\n\nThe setting of the study should be described in detail and the\nreport should include information on whether it was a community or\npopulation-based study, as opposed to a hospital-based study or a\nstudy based on laboratory or administrative records. The locations,\nrelevant dates including the periods of recruitment, exposure,\nfollow-up, and data collection should be reported.\n\nExample: This study provided a detailed description of the setting\nin which the research was conducted: \"The study was conducted in\nSoweto, a township on the outskirts of Johannesburg, South Africa.\nSoweto is predominantly urban and peri-urban, low-income with\nlimited educational and employment opportunities. It has the highest\npopulation density in South Africa, comprises more than 40 suburbs\nwithin 61 km ^2^ , and is estimated to house over two million\ninhabitants\".\n\nExample: This study reported the source of the data and the dates of\ncollection: \"The Swedish InfCareHIV database includes demographic\nand clinical information as well as genotyping results and the viral\npol sequences obtained in routine clinical care from more than 99%\nof Swedish residents with known HIV infection. As of March 2017, the\ntime of the latest data extraction, 10 858 patients were registered\nin the database of whom 7151 were still followed up at the Swedish\nHIV clinics.\"\n\n-\n5\\)\n\nParticipants:\n\nThe participants in the study should be fully characterised using\neligibility and exclusion criteria. Given that drug resistance may\nvary across different population types it is critical to report the\ntarget population of the study and how they were defined. They\nshould also report the source of participant data (e.g., hospital\ncharts, registries, self report).\n\nExample: This study reported the inclusion criteria and exclusion\ncriteria of the included participants: \"In this retrospective study,\nwe included 1138 HIV-positive adults aged 18 years or greater who\ninitiated cART (combination Anti Retroviral Therapy) of 2 NRTIs plus\n1 nNRTI at 3 major designated hospitals (National Taiwan University\nHospital, Taipei; Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, New Taipei City;\nand Taoyuan General Hospital, Taoyuan) with access to genotypic\nresistance testing in northern Taiwan between June 2012 and\nMarch 2016. Patients without genotypic resistance data and those\nwith RAMs (resistance-associated mutations) to nNRTIs or NRTIs at\nbaseline were excluded from analysis.\" ^25^\n\nExample: This study focused on men who have sex with men (MSM): \"A\ncross-sectional study was conducted among newly diagnosed\nHIV-infected MSM.\" ^26^\n\n-\n6\\)\n\nVariables:\n\nIt is of interest to readers to know the mechanism of HIV drug\nresistance reported because the implications differ. Readers should\nbe able to identify if the HIVDR reported in TDR, ADR or PDR. If the\nauthors are reporting on recent infections, they should provide\ninformation that characterises how recent HIV infection were defined\nin their study, especially for TDR.\n\nExample: In this study the authors clarified the type of resistance\nthey were interested in measuring: \"To provide information about the\nepidemic trends of HIV and to optimize the treatment strategies in\nAnhui, the prevalence of surveillance/transmitted drug resistance\nmutations (SDRMs) was evaluated in ART-naïve MSM who were newly\ndiagnosed as HIV-infected in 2011.\" ^26^\n\nExample: Here the authors were interested in pretreatment drug\nresistance: \"In the current report, we analyzed the characteristics\nof participants enrolled into the surveys, and estimated the point\nprevalence of Pre-treatment DR (PDR)....\" ^27^\n\n-\n7\\)\n\nLaboratory methods.\n\nA clear description of the laboratory methods ensures that the\nmethods used can be replicated and compared. The type of the\nspecimen used for drug resistance should be reported (plasma or\ndried blood spots \\[DBS\\]). Plasma-based samples provide information\non the HIV drug resistance profile of the population of replicating\nviruses while DBS specimens may also include archival HIV DNA in\nlatent cell reservoirs, potentially creating discrepancies in the\nestimates observed. ^28^ The methods used for viral load testing,\nparticularly the lower limit of detection, especially since virus\nmust be detected for genotyping.

For example, some laboratories have\nspecific quality assurance procedures in place. ^32\\ ,\\ 33^\n\n-\n8\\)\n\nSampling issues:\n\nAuthors should report how they arrived at their study size and what\nsampling strategy was used, and the data source (e.g., registries).\nThis will allow readers to judge the representativeness of the\nresults.\n\nExample: This study described how they arrived at their sample size:\n\"A minimum sample size of 70 was calculated with EPI Info (95%\nconfidence level). For this calculation, the expected frequency of\nprimary TDR in Suriname was set at 5%. This expected frequency was\nbased on international figures, the relatively young epidemic, and\nthe relatively short history of widespread use of ARV in Suriname.\"\n^34^\n\n-\n9\\)\n\nStatistical methods: Detailed statistical methods as recommended for\nthe study design should be reported. In addition, the approaches\nused to estimate prevalence or incidence and confidence intervals\nshould be reported. If any analytical methods were used to account\nfor the sampling strategy, including weighting or other adjusted\nanalyses, these should be reported. Readers would be interested in\nthe variables used for weighting or used in adjusted analyses.\n\nExample: In this study, the authors conducted a weighted analysis:\n\"A weighted analysis was performed to correct for the number of\npatients enrolled in the I.Co.N.A. cohort and for those who received\na genotypic test at each clinical Center during the specific time\ninterval\" ^35^\n\n### Results\n\n-\n10\\)\n\nParticipants:\n\nAuthors should report the number of individuals at each stage e.g.,\nnumbers potentially eligible, examined for eligibility, confirmed\neligible, included in the study, and number successfully genotyped.\nIf any participants were not included at any stage or if data are\nmissing for any variables of interest, these should be reported. A\nflow diagram may be helpful in showing participant flow through the\nstudy.\n\nExample: In this study, the authors used a flow chart to show the\nnumber of participants who accepted a drug resistance test, the\nnumber successfully genotyped, the number excluded due to lack of\ndata, exposure to ART and presence or absence of drug resistance.\n^36^\n\n-\n11\\)\n\nDescriptive data:\n\nThe characteristics of the study participants (e.g., demographic,\nclinical, social) and information on exposures and potential\nconfounders should be reported. These may include age, sex/gender,\nmigration status, risk factors or transmission risk group (e.g., sex\nworkers \\[SW\\], men who have sex with men \\[MSM\\], people who inject\ndrugs \\[PWID\\]), timing of infection, viral load at time of\ninfection, CD4 cell counts, and exposures to antiretroviral drugs\n(including ART, PrEP, Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission\n\\[PMTCT\\]), level of adherence to ART). For children, the HIV status\nof the mother, maternal breastfeeding, and maternal and infant\ntreatment history, might be of interest. This can be facilitated by\nusing a table.\n\nExample: The authors of this paper include a table showing the age,\ngender, marital status, occupation, literacy, risk factors, blood\ntransfusions, prison record and coinfection (hepatitis B and C) of\nthe participants. ^37^\n\n-\n12\\)\n\nMain results:\n\nAuthors should provide estimates with their precision and report the\nnumbers and proportions with any drug resistance mutations, for each\nclass (NNRTI, NRTI, PI, INSTI) and for each drug. They should also\nreport the numbers with more that one resistance mutation, and\nclearly distinguish major/clinically relevant mutations from\nminor/accessory mutations. Where applicable, the main results should\nbe reported for each subgroup. This can be facilitated by using a\ntable.\n\nExample: The authors present the impact of transmitted drug\nresistance on the first-line regimen, \"Of 11 patients harboring\nNNRTIs mutations, all of them were forecasted to have intermediate\nor high-level resistance to Efavirenz (EFV, 2.0%) and Nevirapine\n(NVP, 2.0%), followed by Rilpivirine (RPV, 1.1%) and Etravirine\n(ETR, 1.1%). ^38^\n\nExample: The authors present their main findings in a table showing\nthe prevalence of mutations with 95% confidence intervals, and by\ndrug class. ^39^\n\n-\n13\\)\n\nOther analyses:\n\nIf other analyses were conducted, such as adjusted analyses or\nphylogenetic analyses, they should be reported.\n\nExample: The authors in this paper performed a phylogenetic analyses\nand network construction, specifying the number of people the\nsequences were generated from along with denominators and\npercentages. \"Phylogenetic analysis showed that 325 (60.0%) of 542\nsequences of this study grouped in 72 transmission clusters compared\nof 2 or more individuals..\\[..\\]..The prevalence of treatment drug\nresistance was not significantly different among individuals who\nwere part of clusters and who were not \\[4.6% (15/325) vs. 8.3%\n(18/217), respectively; P =0.1\\] ^38^\n\n-\n14\\)\n\nDiscussion:\n\nAuthors should discuss the generalizability of their findings\nbearing in mind the study sample, the sampling strategy, and any\nlimitations.\n\nExample: The authors in this paper discuss the generalizability of\ntheir sample, \"Although not all autonomous communities in Spain are\nrepresented in this study, we succeeded in including the areas with\nthe higher concentration of HIV cases, representing 78% of the\nSpanish population, but 85% of new HIV diagnoses\". ^40^\n\n-\n15\\)\n\nAdditional information:\n\nThe authors should specify if the nucleotide sequence data are\npublicly available, available upon request or not, and report the\nrepository where they are stored, the digital object identifier\n(DOI;if available) and the procedures for access, where applicable.\nThey should also report the Genbank Accession Numbers for the\nnucleotide sequences used.

The use of this checklist\nwill facilitate pooling in systematic reviews and meta-analyses and\nallow a full understanding of the drug resistance HIV situation in the\nspecific location of the study, in the relevant population, at the time\nthat specimens were collected. This granular undertaking not only\nadvances general knowledge but facilitates translation of data from\nresearch to public health policy, thus enhancing the impact of research.\nScience, and reporting science is always evolving. We anticipate that\nthere will be future updates to CEDRIC-HIV to ensure that it keeps up\nwith changes in data science, genotyping technology, and ethics. There\nis also value in translating the checklist into various languages to\nfacilitate its use by diverse audiences. Our website will be a forum\nwhere end-users can provide feedback and propose various ways in which\nthe value, uptake and use of CEDRIC-HIV can be enhanced.\n\nAs knowledge regarding what are the primary and secondary mutations and\npolymorphisms implicated in drug resistance and their impact on drug\nsusceptibility continues to evolve, the application of the CEDRIC- HIV\nguidelines and the information collected will assist in improving our\nunderstanding of drug resistance mutations and polymorphisms and their\nrole in drug responses.\n\nWe encourage journals to adopt these guidelines and to include them in\ntheir instructions for authors.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 20718620\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: We also analyzed the amino acid sequences for the presence of drug resistance mutations according to the last update of the WHO list for the surveillance of drug resistance mutations in antiretroviral-naive patients (SDRM version 2009, http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/WHOResistanceList.html).

We report a case of dolutegravir\nresistance detected in a treatment-naive perinatally HIV-infected infant\nwhose mother was receiving tenofovir/lamivudine/dolutegravir. This case\nwas detected during a national survey of HIV drug resistance in Haiti\namongst infants testing positive for HIV through the national early\ninfant diagnosis program between April 2020 and March 2021. This unique\ncase underscores the need for prompt management of high viral loads in\npregnant and breastfeeding women and supports HIV drug resistance\nsurveillance efforts targeted at antiretroviral therapy-naive infants\nborn to mothers in low-and middle-income countries.\n\n\n##\n\nThe rapid decrease in plasma levels of HIV RNA in women receiving\ndolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART), coupled with high\nlevels of viral load suppression, is associated with potential reduction\nin mother-to-child-transmission and raises hopes for eliminating\nmother-to-child transmission of HIV \\[ 1 -- 5 \\]. However, a small\nnumber of perinatally acquired HIV infections has been reported among\ninfants born to mothers receiving DTG-based ART \\[ 3 \\]; thus raising\nconcerns for possible integrase inhibitor resistance in infants infected\nwith HIV, despite interventions preventing mother-to-child HIV\ntransmission (PMTCT).\n\nHIV drug resistance (HIVDR) in perinatally HIV-infected infants may\noccur because of infection with drug-resistant virus, exposure to\nsub-therapeutic levels of antiretroviral drugs in breastmilk or during\ninfant postnatal prophylaxis (PNP) \\[ 6 -- 8 \\]. Prior studies have\nshown high levels of resistance in ART-naive infants, especially to\nnonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) used for PNP and\nto nucleot(s)ides reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) \\[ 9 -- 11\n\\]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is the first study\nreporting detectable DTG resistance in an ART-naive infant. The\npotential for selection of HIVDR in this population has been\nextrapolated from pharmacokinetic studies showing detectable but\nsub-therapeutic levels of DTG in breastmilk \\[ 12 , 13 \\]. Moreover,\nDTG-resistant virus can be selected in mothers with sub-optimal\nadherence to DTG-based ART and, subsequently, may be transmitted to\ninfants.\n\nRecently, WHO recommended using DTG-containing ART for children aged at\nleast 4 weeks and weighing at least 3 kg \\[ 1 \\]; thus, DTG resistance\nin ART-naive infants may impact treatment outcomes. We report a case of\nDTG resistance detected in an ART-naive infant identified in Haiti\nduring a national survey of HIVDR in infants less than 18 months of age\ndiagnosed with HIV through the country\\'s early infant diagnosis\nprogram.\n\nFollowing, WHO survey guidance \\[ 14 \\], Haiti conducted a survey of HIV\ndrug resistance in infants between April 2020 and March 2021. Nucleic\nacids were extracted from remnant dried blood spot specimens collected\nat the time of HIV diagnosis and sequenced using a Sanger-based method\nat the WHO-designated laboratory, Service de Virologie, University\nHospital of Martinique in Fort de France. Sequences were quality-assured\nfollowing WHO recommendations \\[ 15 \\]. HIVDR was predicted using the\nStanford HIVdb algorithm Version 9.09. Sequences with low-level,\nintermediate-level, or high-level resistance were classified as\nresistant. HIVDR prevalence estimates were assessed using the 'svy'\nutilities in Stata (Stata 12; StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA)\nwith weighting to adjust for genotypic failure rate.\n\nDuring the survey period, 5185 infants were born to HIV-infected\nmothers; 276 (5.3%) of the infants tested positive for HIV. Of these,\n143 (52%) had remnant specimens available for HIVDR testing of which 121\n(85%) and 105 (73%) yielded a successful quality-assured genotype for\nprotease/reverse transcriptase (PR/RT) and integrase regions,\nrespectively. The mean age of the infants was 8.2 months \\[95%\nconfidence interval (CI) 7.3--9.2\\], and the majority (62.7%, 95% CI\n54.3--70.3%) had experienced exposure to antiretroviral drugs for PMTCT.\nMost mothers had received DTG-based ART (70%, 95% CI 58.9--79.5), and\nmost infants (55.2%, 95% CI 46.5--62.3) had been breastfed or were\nbreastfeeding at the time of specimen collection.\n\nThe overall prevalence of resistance to EFV/NVP was 50.9% (95% CI\n41.7--60.0). The prevalence of any NRTI resistance was 11.2% (95% CI\n6.6--18.5) and was driven by ABC and 3TC resistance (10.3%, 95% CI\n5.5--17.4), 92% of which was because of the M184V mutation alone which\nconfers low-level resistance to ABC (Fig. ​ (Fig.1). 1 ). No protease\ninhibitor resistance was detected. The prevalence of resistance to\nintegrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) was 1.1% (95% CI 0.1--7.3)\nand was due to the R263K mutation detected in one infant (Fig. ​ (Fig.1),\n1 ), whose mother was receiving tenofovir/lamivudine/dolutegravir as a\nfixed-dose combination for the treatment of her HIV infection. R263K\ncauses intermediate-level resistance to DTG, cabotegravir, bictegravir,\nand elvitegravir and low-level resistance to raltegravir. In addition to\nINSTI resistance, the infant\\'s virus also had detected resistance to\nABC and 3TC because of the M184V mutation and EFV/NVP resistance due to\nthe K103N mutation. This infant was first diagnosed with HIV at\n14 months of age and had received ZDV-based PNP. The infant\\'s mother\nhad initiated ART (tenofovir/lamivudine/dolutegravir) 6 months before\ndelivery. Information on the mother\\'s prior ART and prior HIV diagnosis\n(if different from the one at ART initiation during pregnancy) was\nunavailable. The mother was generally nonadherent to clinical\nappointments and had detectable HIV viral load 3 weeks before delivery\n(7761 copies/ml); no drug resistance test was conducted on the mother\\'s\nvirus. Eight months after delivery, the mother\\'s viral load was less\nthan 1000 copies/ml.\n\nFig. 1\n\nPrevalence and patterns of HIV drug resistance-associated mutations\namong antiretroviral therapy-naive children less than 18 months of age\nnewly diagnosed with HIV in Haiti.\n\nThe prevalence and patterns of HIV drug resistance-associated mutations\namong infants aged 18 months or less who are newly diagnosed with HIV\nand treatment-naive in Haiti, 2020--2021 are shown.\n\nIn this national survey of HIVDR in ART-naive infants in Haiti, the\nprevalence of INSTI resistance was very low in this population,\noccurring in only one of 58 infants whose mothers were receiving\nDTG-based ART. Nonetheless, the presence of DTG resistance in this one\ninfant merits attention and signals a need for further surveillance in\nthis population as DTG-based ART is rolled out globally because of\nlimited available treatment options and the need for lifelong treatment.\n\nPharmacokinetic studies have shown that DTG can be passed through the\nplacenta and breastmilk in sub-therapeutic levels raising concerns for\nselection of drug resistance \\[ 12 , 13 \\]. However, to date, no such\ncase has been reported in literature despite pharmacokinetic studies\npredicting its possible occurrence \\[ 12 , 13 \\]. In light of these\nconcerns, there is need to strengthen surveillance systems to assess\nHIVDR in newly infected ART-naive infants to guide optimal treatment and\nprevention strategies. In the absence of routine drug resistance testing\nin most settings, close treatment monitoring with timely treatment\nswitch is critical, especially as DTG is scaled up in paediatric\npopulations worldwide. Wherever feasible and affordable, countries may\nconsider prioritizing HIVDR testing in ART-naive, DTG-exposed infants\ninitiating DTG-containing regimens to prevent further selection and\naccumulation of resistance and to guide optimal regimen selection.\nResults also underscore the need for ART optimization and prompt\nmanagement of high viral loads in pregnant and breastfeeding women to\nfurther minimize HIV transmission including transmission of\ndrug-resistant virus.\n\nThe high prevalence of NRTI and NNRTI resistance is consistent with\nfindings of similar studies \\[ 9 -- 11 \\] and underscores the need to\nfast track adoption of optimal paediatric ART, including regimens using\nDTG, and close treatment monitoring to ensure successful treatment\noutcomes in this population \\[ 1 \\].\n\nA key limitation of this analysis is the inability to ascertain if the\ninfant was infected with a DTG-resistant virus or if the resistance was\nselected because of ingesting sub-therapeutic levels of DTG in\nbreastmilk. It is, however, worth noting that, as the infant was not\nreceiving a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor containing\nPNP, it is likely that the observed resistance may at least be\nattributed to infection with a resistant virus. Overall, well designed\nstudies are needed to determine the mechanism of DTG resistance in\nperinatally infected infants and prevention strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, we report the first case of detected DTG resistance in an\nART-naive HIV-infected infant identified from a nationally\nrepresentative survey in Haiti. While the near absence of INSTI\nresistance is highly reassuring, close monitoring of infants initiating\nART is required to ensure successful treatment outcomes. Strengthening\nroutine HIVDR surveillance will also help detect any possible increase\nin the prevalence of DTG resistance in this population and provide\ninformation to guide paediatric HIV treatment in countries using a\npublic-health approach.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 30517632\nQuestion ID: 6\nQuestion: From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?\nEvidence: Pre-treatment drug resistance and HIV-1 subtypes in infants from Argentina with and without exposure to antiretroviral drugs for prevention of mother-to-child transmission.

To assess the prevalence and patterns of pre-treatment HIV drug resistance (PDR) and HIV-1 subtype in infants from Argentina with exposure to different antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT).\nRationale: The paper mentions the individuals were not treated before starting first-line ART. But the mother had exposed to different ARVs for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission. The paper does not mention virological failure.\nAnswer: Not reported\n\nPMID: 36578581\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \" Abstract\n\nIntegrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-containing regimens in HIV-1-infected patients have experienced a global increase. Recently, WHO has emphasized the need to fast-track the transition to dolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral (ARV) treatments. However, continued surveillance of INSTI resistance is recommended. In this study, clinical, epidemiological, and virological features associated with INSTI resistance diagnosed in Spain were analyzed. Samples collected between 2008 and 2021 from HIV-1-infected patients were analyzed in integrase, protease, and reverse transcriptase using Sanger population sequencing. ARV drug resistance was evaluated with the Stanford University HIVdb program. Among 2,696 patients, 174 (6.5%) had INSTI resistance, all of them to first-generation INSTIs, and 71 (2.6%) had also resistance to second-generation INSTIs. Of these, only 5 individuals were exposed to DTG as the only INSTI, in whom resistance development was associated with poor treatment adherence and/or resistance to other ARV classes. Of newly HIV-1-diagnosed individuals, 0.92% harbored INSTI-resistant viruses, with low prevalences maintained along time, and only one had low-level resistance to DTG. Persons who inject drugs, age over 39 years, resistance to other ARV classes, and longer time from diagnosis were associated with INSTI resistance (p < 0.001). Non-subtype B INSTI-resistant viruses lacked the Q148H + G140S resistance pathway and showed lower INSTI resistance levels than subtype B viruses. In conclusion, INSTI resistance is uncommon and associated with long-term infections, older age and additional resistance to other ARV drug classes, and is rare in newly diagnosed HIV-1 infections. Our results also support the preferential use of DTG-containing regimens in first-line treatments, although surveillance of INSTI resistance is encouraged.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the analysis of drug resistance mutations and their prevalence in patient samples, but it does not mention conducting in vitro drug susceptibility tests.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 37112921\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Transmitted HIV Drug Resistance in Bulgaria Occurs in Clusters of Individuals from Different Transmission Groups and Various Subtypes (2012--2020)\nAbstract\nTransmitted HIV drug resistance in Bulgaria was first reported in 2015 using data from 1988--2011. We determined the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity in Bulgaria during 2012--2020 using polymerase sequences from 1053 of 2010 (52.4%) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. Sequences were analyzed for DRM using the WHO HIV SDRM list implemented in the calculated population resistance tool at Stanford University. Genetic diversity was inferred using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetics. Cluster detection and characterization was performed using MicrobeTrace. The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%). Most (34/60, 56.7%) of the SDRMs were present in transmission clusters of different subtypes composed mostly of male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC), including a 14-member cluster of subtype B sequences from 12 MMSC and two males reporting heterosexual contact; 13 had the L90M PI mutation and one had the T215S NRTI SDRM. We found a low SDRM prevalence amid high HIV-1 diversity among ART-naive patients in Bulgaria during 2012--2020. The majority of SDRMs were found in transmission clusters containing MMSC, indicative of onward spread of SDRM in drug-naive individuals. Our study provides valuable information on the transmission dynamics of HIV drug resistance in the context of high genetic diversity in Bulgaria, for the development of enhanced prevention strategies to end the epidemic.\n\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity using sequences from ART-naive individuals.

Pre-existing drug resistance was\ndefined using the mutations considered by the Stanford HIV Drug\nResistance Database (HIVDB v8.6) to calculate the genotypic\nsusceptibility score (GSS, estimating the number of active drugs) for\nthe first-line regimen at the detection threshold windows of \\>20%,\n\\>5%, and \\>2% of the viral population. Survival analysis was conducted\nto evaluate the association between the GSS and risk of TF (viral\nload \\>200 copies/mL plus treatment change).\n\n### Results\n\nBaseline NGS data were available for 1380 antiretroviral therapy\n(ART)-naïve participants enrolled over 2009--2013. First-line ART\nincluded a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) in 976\n(71%), a boosted protease inhibitor in 297 (22%), or an integrase strand\ntransfer inhibitor in 107 (8%). The proportions of participants with\nGSS \\<3 were 7% for \\>20%, 10% for \\>5%, and 17% for the \\>2%\nthresholds, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio of TF associated\nwith a GSS of 0--2.75 versus 3 in the subset of participants with\nmutations detected at the \\>2% threshold was 1.66 (95% confidence\ninterval 1.01--2.74; *p* = 0.05) and 2.32 (95% confidence interval\n1.32--4.09; *p* = 0.003) after restricting the analysis to participants\nwho started an NNRTI-based regimen.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nUp to 17% of participants initiated ART with a GSS \\<3 on the basis of\nNGS data. Minority variants were predictive of TF, especially for\nparticipants starting NNRTI-based regimens.\n\n\n## METHODS\n\n### Study population and sequencing\n\nThe START trial, conducted by the International Network for Strategic\nInitiatives in Global HIV Trials, enrolled ART-naïve participants with\nHIV between April 2009 and December 2013. The study design and data\ncollection plan for START has previously been reported \\[ 23 , 24 \\]. A\nplasma sample, taken within 60 days before enrolment was obtained from\nall participants who provided consent for stored specimens.\n\nMethods for sample preparation, amplification of viral RNA and NGS,\nidentification of DRM by means of VirVarSeq, and determination of HIV\nsubtype have been described elsewhere \\[ 25 , 26 \\].\n\nSequence reads (FASTQ files) were analyzed with VirVarSeq version\n20140929, which calls variants at the codon level \\[ 27 \\]. From the\noutput, we extracted amino acid frequencies in the *pol* gene from amino\nacid position 1--935 where positions 1--99 encode protease protein,\npositions 100--659 encode reverse transcriptase protein, and positions\n660--935 partially encode integrase protein (our amplicon did not cover\npositions 936--947) \\[ 25 \\].\n\n### Definition of pre-existing drug resistance and phenotypic drug susceptibility\n\nIn this analysis, we considered all mutations used by the Stanford HIV\nDrug Resistance Database (HIVDB) HIVdb algorithm v8.6 to provide\ngenotypic test result interpretation. Of note, the Stanford HIVdb\nalgorithm considers a much wider range of mutations than those\nconsidered by the World Health Organization (WHO) 2009 surveillance list\nused in previous analyses of these datasets \\[ 27 - 29 \\]. The Stanford\nHIVdb interpretation was used to calculate a genotypic susceptibility\nscore (GSS) for the drugs included in participants\\' first-line regimens\nas follows \\[ 30 \\]: each drug included in the initial regimen was given\nan individual numerical score of 1 if the interpretation was 'no\nresistance' (fully active drug), 0.75 if potential low level, 0.5 if low\nlevel, 0.25 if intermediate, and 0 if high level of resistance (zero\nactivity of the drug). The GSS for a regimen was the sum of the\nindividual scores for the drugs included in the regimen and estimated\nthe total number of drugs predicted to be active. For a triple\ncombination regimen, GSS varies between 0 and 3. Detail regarding our\nchoice for sequencing depth and thresholds for calling DRMs are reported\nin the Appendix.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nCharacteristics of participants were described and compared across GSS\nstrata, grouped as 0--2.75 versus 3 (i.e., partially vs. fully active\nregimen) at the \\>20% threshold. The compared the distribution of\ncategorical variables using a chi-squared test and of continuous\nvariables using the Mann--Whitney U test. The breakdown of the exact\nfirst-line treatment was also shown overall and by GSS strata. We also\ndescribed the distribution of the HIVDB interpretation scores separately\nby antiretroviral drug and according to threshold window used.\n\nThe primary endpoint of this analysis was treatment failure (TF), a\ncomposite outcome defined at the time of two possible failure events:\n(1) the time of experiencing a single plasma HIV RNA \\>200 copies/mL\nafter \\>6 months of therapy initiation if this event was followed by a\nchange of one or more drugs (including discontinuation) of the regimen\nreceived at time of the elevated HIV RNA value or (2) the time of pure\nconfirmed VF, defined at the time of the first of two consecutive\nHIV-RNA viral loads \\>200 copies/mL. For both components of the primary\nendpoint, survival time accrued from the date of therapy initiation\nuntil the date of the failure event or the date of the last available\nHIV RNA measure, whichever occurred first. All available viral loads\nwere used, and the main assumption behind definition (1) is that therapy\nchanges occurring after having observed a viral load \\>200 copies/mL\nwere with the intent of re-suppressing the viral load.\n\nStandard unweighted Kaplan--Meier and Cox regression model analysis were\nperformed. Suboptimal GSS was defined as having fewer than three active\ndrugs. The association between GSS (fitted as a binary covariate 0--2.75\nvs. 3 at the various thresholds) and the risk of experiencing the\nendpoints was evaluated in univariable analyses and after controlling\nfor a number of variables chosen from the following initial list: age,\nsex, geographical region, mode of HIV transmission, hepatitis\nco-infection status, baseline CD4 count and HIV RNA, trial arm,\nnon-adherence, HIV subtype, year of starting ART, and type of ART\nstarted. We used a direct acyclic graph to describe our assumptions\nregarding the underlying causal structure of the data. On the basis of\nthese assumptions, only baseline HIV RNA, geographical region,\nintervention arm of START (immediate vs. deferred ART), and year of\nstarting ART were deemed as common causes of both the exposure of\ninterest and the outcome and so were included in the multivariable\nmodels as potential confounders (Supplementary Figure S1 ).\n\nA first sensitivity analysis was performed after restricting\nparticipants to those with Sanger GSS ≥2 (the subset in which NGS is\nlikely to provide additional benefit, *n* = 1349, Table S1B ). A second\nsensitivity analysis was performed using an alternative endpoint of TF,\nwhich, for the component (1), only counted the discontinuations of ART\nfollowing failure as events. Reasons for discontinuing drugs as coded by\nthe treating physicians were summarized. Linear regression analysis\ncontrolling for extra-sample error distribution by means of cross\nvalidation was also used to identify mutations at the 2--20% level\nassociated with the week 4 decline in HIV RNA. We also calculated the\nhazard ratios (HRs) of TF associated with these identified mutations.\nMore details for the linear regression analysis are shown in the\nSupplementary material.\n\nA two-sided test of \\<0.05 was considered statistically significant. All\nstatistical analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.4\n(Carey NC, USA).\n\n::: section\n\n## RESULTS\n\nOverall, of the 1819 participants with NGS data at the ≥200 read depth,\n1380 (76%) who started ART with three or more drugs, either in the\nimmediate or the deferred arm, and had virological follow-up of ≥1 month\nwere included in this analysis. Table 1 shows the main characteristics\nof the study population, a selection of factors potentially associated\nwith the risk of VF to HIV treatment, stratified by GSS groups using the\n20% detection threshold. Of note, 96 of 1380 participants (7%) started a\nregimen predicted by GSS to include fewer than three active drugs at\nthis threshold. The two GSS groups appeared to be balanced in terms of\ndemographics and immune-virological factors. The only marked differences\nwere in region of enrolment, where South America was over-represented in\nthe group with a GSS of 0--2.75. In contrast, participants in Africa and\nthe USA appeared to be more likely to have a GSS = 3 (chi-squared *p*\n\\< 0.001). In addition, the median time from HIV diagnosis for\nparticipants in the GSS of 0--2.75 group was on average 3 months shorter\nthan that of the GSS = 3 group ( *p* = 0.02, Table 1 ). Of note,\nparticipants\\' characteristics were similar when other window thresholds\nwere used to define the GSS groups (see Table S1A for the \\>2% threshold\nfor example). The proportion of participants with a GSS of 0--2.75 using\nthis threshold was increased at 17.0% (235/1380).\n\nSupplementary Figure S2 shows the breakdown of antiretroviral regimens;\nthe large majority of the population initiated a triple-drug regimen\nthat included tenofovir/emtricitabine (FTC) ( *n* = 80 \\[83% of those\nwith GSS = 0--2.75\\] and *n* = 1148 \\[89% of those with GSS = 3\\]) in\ncombination with efavirenz (77% of the GSS = 0--2.75 group vs. 63% of\nthe GSS = 3 group).\n\nFigure 1a--c shows the breakdown of the Stanford predictions for drug\ncomponents of the initial regimen of participants, stratified by the\nthreshold window used to define resistance. Using the 20% Sanger\nthreshold, participants\\' viruses showed high-level resistance to\nefavirenz (3%) and lamivudine (3TC) or FTC (0.7 and 0.2%, respectively)\nwhile there appeared to be intermediate resistance to elvitegravir (6%)\nbut not to the other INSTIs. Interestingly, as seen in previous analyses\nof this same dataset, by lowering the threshold for resistance detection\nto \\>2%, a higher percentage of participants appeared to have a virus\nwith high-level resistance to raltegravir (1.5%) and 1--3% retaining\nhigh-level resistance to 3TC/FTC and 6% to rilpivirine and efavirenz.\nBecause a large proportion of mutations were detected at very low\nlevels, more resistance (at any level) was detected at the \\>2%\nthreshold (Figure 1c ) than at the \\>5% threshold (Figure 1b ).\n\nAt the \\>2% threshold, T215 revertant ( *n* = 47, 3.4%), M41L ( *n*\n= 31, 2.3%), and K219QENR ( *n* = 28, 2.0%) were the most prevalent NRTI\nmutations. Mutations D67NGE and K70RE were detected in 1.2% of\nparticipants ( *n* = 17 and *n* = 16, respectively). Notably, the K65R\nmutation was not observed in any sample, even at this low threshold.\nM184V and M184I were detected in seven (0.5%) and 11 (0.8%)\nparticipants, respectively. The most common NNRTI DRMs were K103NS ( *n*\n= 47, 3.4%), G190ASE ( *n* = 39, 2.8%), and E138K ( *n* = 22, 1.6%). The\nprevalence of PI PDR was strongly influenced by the M46IL mutation,\nwhich was observed in 6.2% of participants ( *n* = 86). The D30N\nmutation was detected in 28 (2.0%) and the L90M in six (0.4%). Other\ncommonly detected mutations in the PI region were F53LY, I54VLMATS, and\nV82ATFSCML (in \\~0.6% of participants). The most common individual INSTI\nDRMs were T66AIK ( *n* = 6, 0.4%), G140ACRS ( *n* = 8, 0.6%), Y143CHR (\n*n* = 7, 0.5%), and Q148HKR ( *n* = 7, 0.5%), all with a prevalence of\n\\<1%.\n\nOverall, 85 participants met our definition of primary endpoint of TF.\nUsing the 20% threshold, by 2 years from starting ART, the estimated\nproportion of participants who experienced TF were 13.0% (95% confidence\ninterval \\[CI\\] 5.8--20.2) in the GSS 0--2.75 group versus 5.0% (95% CI\n3.8--6.3) in the GSS = 3 group (log-rank *p* = 0.006, Figure 2a ).\nImportantly, \\~10% in the GSS 0--2.75 group (95% CI 3.9--16.5%) had\nalready experienced TF after 12 months of starting therapy.\n\nInterestingly, in the unweighted survival analysis, performed separately\nusing the three threshold windows, the strongest evidence against the\nnull hypothesis was for the Sanger threshold (\\>20%) as compared with\nthe minority variants thresholds (Figure 2a--c ). For the \\>2%\nthreshold, the Kaplan--Meier estimates of TF by 2.5 years were 7.1% (95%\nCI 3.2--10.9%) in the GSS 0--2.75 group versus 5.0% (95% CI 3.5--6.5) in\nthe GSS = 3 group (log-rank *p* = 0.03, Figure 2c ).\n\nThe results obtained in the unadjusted analysis were confirmed after\ncontrolling for the set of identified potential confounders\n(Supplementary Figure S1 , Table 2 ). In particular, we estimated\na \\>2-fold difference in risk of TF by GSS group using the Sanger window\nthreshold, although an effect as small as a 16% increase in risk as well\nas a 4-fold increase in risk were all values compatible with the data\n(Table 2A ). Of note, participants with a GSS in the 0--2.75 group were\nalso at increased risk of TF when using the \\>2% window threshold for\nresistance, although the effect size was much smaller (adjusted for the\nconfounders described in the direct acyclic graph \\[Figure S1 \\],\nHR 1.66; 95% CI 1.01--2.71, *p* = 0.04). Among the 27 ART\ndiscontinuations, the reasons for the change were as follows: 12 (44%)\nfor failure (high HIV RNA *n* = 9, low CD4 count *n* = 1 and detection\nof resistance *n* = 2, one of which also had an elevated HIV RNA), nine\n(33%) for intolerance/toxicity, four (15%) for simplification (i.e.,\nstop before switching to a simpler regimen), and the remaining two\n(0.7%) for other/unknown reasons. Results were similar when we used the\nalternative endpoint of TF, which only counted the discontinuations due\nto failure as events ( *n* = 77 total events, Table S2 ).\n\nInterestingly, in the main adjusted analysis, results were compatible\nwith the null hypothesis of no difference when using the intermediate\n\\>5% window threshold. Of note, all these associations were much\nstronger and were all significant ( *p* \\< 0.05) when we restricted the\nanalysis to participants who started a regimen with an NNRTI as the\nanchor drug (Table 2B , Table S3 ). The results of the sensitivity\nanalysis after restricting to participants with windows of 2--20% and\n5--20% were consistent with those of the main analysis (Table 2A,B ).\nSupplementary Figure S3 and some supplemental text show the results of\nthe analysis investigating the association between individual mutations\nand HIV RNA decline.\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nOne key finding of this analysis is that PDR detected in \\>20% of the\nvirus population was a confirmed determinant of failure of first-line\nART. Of note, participants in START were treatment naïve because this\nwas an entry criterion for the trial. Therefore, the most likely\nmechanism for study participants to have detectable HIV genotypic\nresistance at study entry would be due to infection with a resistant\nstrain. Importantly, the results also confirm that PDR detected at \\>2%\nwas also predictive of TF in our study population. We estimated a 66%\nincrease in risk of TF in those with suboptimal versus optimal GSS but\nan increase risk as small as 1% was also compatible with the data, as\nindicated by the confidence limits. Importantly, the association was\nparticularly strong when restricting to the participants who started\nfirst-line therapy with NNRTI-based regimens (\\>2-fold increase in\nrisk). The results were also confirmed in several sensitivity analyses.\n\nOf interest, the proportion that started a regimen predicted by the\nStanford GSS to have suboptimal activity was low at 6.7% (96/138) when\nusing the routine detection threshold of \\>20%. This could be due to the\nlack of routine testing in a particular region of recruitment in the\ntrial, to the use of different systems to interpret the results, or to\nthe time between the date of the stored sample and that of ART\ninitiation. Indeed, our data support the fact that people who started\nsuboptimal therapy were enriched in South America as compared with in\nEurope or the USA. The GSS 0--2.75 group also appeared to have had their\nHIV infection diagnosed more recently than those in the GSS = 3 group.\nIn contrast, the median time from the date of stored sample and ART\ninitiation was 12 months because of the inclusion of participants in\nboth study treatment arms, with no difference by GSS groups.\n\nThe analysis also confirms the results presented in our previous work,\nshowing that a large proportion of the PDR mutations were detected at a\nlevel between 2% and 5% \\[ 24 \\]. This appeared to be particularly\nmarked for INSTI-associated mutations but to a lesser extent for\nNNRTI-associated mutations, namely rilpivirine. When the association\nbetween individual mutations and week 4 change in viral load was\ninvestigated, INSTI-associated mutations N155H and G140ACRS detected at\nthe 2--20% threshold appeared to be those more strongly associated with\na slower decline (association was not significant, but the prevalence of\nthese mutations was very low, affecting the power of the analysis).\n\nIn a systematic review of 25 studies examining the impact of minority\nvariants on initial ART, only 11 (44%) showed an association between the\ndetection of pre-existing minority variants and risk of VF of\nNNRTI-based first-line regimens \\[ 13 , 14 , 22 , 31 - 34 \\]. However,\nthe review included heterogeneous studies with respect to target\npopulation, definition of the exposure, exact regimen initiated, and\ndefinition of the outcome, and a quantitative meta-analysis has not been\nperformed. Also, little was done to rank the studies according to\nquality of the study design and statistical methods employed (i.e. how\nconfounding was handled, the presence of other systematic biases such as\nselection and observer bias). For these reasons, it is difficult to\ncompare results, and it appears to be misleading to present the crude\npercentage of studies in favour or against an association.\nInterestingly, the majority of studies showing no association were more\nrecent analyses, conducted in the resource-limited settings in people\nreceiving rilpivirine-based regimens \\[ 35 - 39 \\]. Furthermore, the\nauthors of this review, surprisingly, eventually concluded that minority\nvariants have been shown to be clinically relevant, especially before\nthe initiation of a first-line NNRTI-based regimen \\[ 22 \\]. Our data\nsupport this conclusion.\n\nOne unmet need only partially addressed by this analysis is whether the\ndata support a specific threshold for minority variants (i.e., 2% vs. 5%\nof virus populations) to be used in routine care.\n\nOur findings seem to slightly favour the \\>2% threshold, although much\nlarger studies are needed that stratify by specific target populations,\nmutations, and treatment started to be able to give recommendations for\none threshold over another.\n\nA number of limitations should be discussed. One key limitation is that\nmost participants initiated regimens that are no longer routinely\nstarted in the first line. Unfortunately, although one of the goals was\nto assess the role of minority variants to predict response to\nINSTI-based regimens, our analysis was underpowered to answer this\nquestion. Nevertheless, results are relevant for countries in which\nNNRTI-based regimens are still a prevalent option for first-line\ntherapy. WHO antiretroviral guidelines recommend the use of efavirenz as\nan alternative option in first-line ART regimens \\[ 40 \\], which is\nstill implemented in low- and medium-income counties if levels of\npretreatment drug resistance to NNRTIs are \\<10%. Of course, all our\nresults are valid under the set of strong, mainly untestable,\nassumptions, including no unmeasured confounding, which we cannot rule\nout. Of note, by decreasing the threshold of the detection to 2%, the\nnumber of unusual mutations increased, which may lead to the detection\nof spurious associations because of misclassification of the exposure.\nNevertheless, the NGS data were carefully reviewed by stipulating a\nminimum read depth of 200 across the HIV regions spanning all relevant\nmutations within each gene to minimize chance detection of unusual\nmutations at low levels. Finally, genotypic resistance tests were not\nconducted at time of failure. These additional data could have been\nuseful to verify the extent of outgrowth of the minority variants\ndetected at baseline and provide additional evidence towards a putative\ncausative effect of minority variants as a key determinant of TF. Also,\nit would have given an estimate of the potential impact of accumulated\nresistance on the response to second-line regimens.\n\nIn conclusion, this analysis confirms an association between detectable\nminority variants and risk of failure of first-line ART. Importantly,\ngiven prior conflicting results regarding the impact of NNRTI minority\nvariants, the data confirmed a strong association when the analysis was\nrestricted to the subset of participants who initiated a NNRTI-based\nregimen. Further studies are needed to address other relevant unanswered\nquestions, such as the role of minority variant INSTI-associated\nmutations and whether the ability of minority variants to predict TF\nmight vary by mutational load.\n\n## FUNDING INFORMATION\n\nThe study was supported in part by the National Institute of Allergy and\nInfectious Diseases; National Institutes of Health (grants UM1-AI068641,\nUM1-AI120197); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI; grant\nRO1HL096453); National Institutes of Health Clinical Center; National\nCancer Institute; NHLBI; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of\nChild Health and Human Development; National Institute of Mental Health;\nNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; National\nInstitute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases; Agence\nNationale de Recherches sur le SIDA et les Hepatites Virales (France);\nNational Health and Medical Research Council (Australia); National\nResearch Foundation (Denmark); Bundes ministerium fur Bildung und\nForschung (Germany); European AIDS Treatment Network; Medical Research\nCouncil (UK); National Institute for Health Research; National Health\nService (UK); and the University of Minnesota.

We performed ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) of protease, RT, integrase and gp105 regions. Only mutations in the HIV-2 ANRS list >1% were considered. HIV-2 tropism was assessed by V3 loop region UDS, and each read was interpreted with determinants of CXCR4-coreceptor use.\nResults\nAmong the 47 patients assessed, three displayed plasma viruses with a resistance-associated mutation (RAM) above the 20% detection threshold, all in RT, resulting in a prevalence of transmitted drug resistance for NRTI of 7.9% (95% CI 0.0%--16.5%). No RAM above the 20% detection threshold was found in protease or integrase. At the 1% detection threshold the transmitted drug resistance prevalence was 9.8% (95% CI 0.6%--19.0%), 13.2% (95% CI 3.5%--22.9%) and 4.5% (95% CI 0%--17.5%) for PI, NRTI and integrase inhibitors. The most prevalent MRV was the PI RAM I50V detected in three samples. Tropism analysis showed that 21% of patients (4 of 19) exhibited X4-tropic viruses: two in majority proportion and two in minority proportions (1.5% and 1.9%).\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of minority resistant variants (MRV) and resistance-associated mutations (RAM) in ART-naive HIV-2-infected patients using ultra-deep sequencing (UDS).

Standard first-line regimen in Iran is comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI);  drug resistance mutations for the 3 classes of ART (NNRTI, NRTI, and PI) were observed and 4 samples showed resistance to all of them.\nRationale: The paper mentions the patients got standard treatment, and the evidence indicates the presence of mutations associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, suggesting that individuals in the study had received these drug classes prior to sample sequencing.\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI\n\nPMID: 36016383\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be transmitted via parenteral, sexual, or vertical exposure routes. The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals.

At 144 weeks, the percentage of individuals with HIV-RNA &lt;50 copies/mL was 77.4% (277/358) in the ITT analysis and 95.5% (277/290) in the PP analysis. A total of 68 participants were excluded from the PP analysis (data missing, 25, discontinuation due to toxicity, 19; other, 16; death, 8).

Molecular surveillance\nof new HIV diagnoses with a focus on prevalence and type of resistance\nassociated mutations and the subtype of circulating viruses is\nmandatory.\n\n### Method\n\nFrom 2017 to 2020, 11,527 new HIV diagnoses were reported in Germany to\nthe Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Protease (PR) and reverse-transcriptase\n(RT) sequences were obtained from 4559 (39.6%) cases, and PR, RT and\nintegrase (IN) sequences were obtained from 3097 (26.9%) cases. The\nsequences were analyzed with data from the national HIV reports.\n\n### Results\n\nAmong all cases in the analysis, the proportion of primary resistance\nwas 4.3% for nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 9.2%\nfor non-NRTI (NNRTIs), 3.3% for protease inhibitors (PIs) and 1.4% for\nintegrase inhibitors (INIs). Dual-class resistance was highest for\nNRTIs/NNRTIs with 1.2%. There was no trend in the proportion of viruses\nresistant to drug classes. Most individual key mutations associated with\nrelevant resistance had a prevalence below 1% including K65R (0.1%) and\nM184V (0.6%). A notable exception was K103NS, with a prevalence of 2.9%\nand a significant increase (p ~Trend~ =0.024) during 2017--2020. In this\nperiod, diagnoses of infections with HIV-1 subtype B were the most\ncommon at 58.7%, but its prevalence was declining (p ~Trend~ =0.049)\nwhile the frequency of minority subtypes (each \\< 1%) increased (p\n~Trend~ =0.007). Subtype B was highest (75.6%) in men who have sex with\nmen (MSM) and lowest in reported heterosexual transmissions (HETs,\n22.6%).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe percentage of primary resistance was high but at a stable level. A\ngenotypic determination of resistance is therefore still required before\nthe start of therapy. The subtype diversity of circulating HIV-1 is\nincreasing.\n\n\n## Methods\n\n### Sample material\n\nDue to the national reporting obligation for relevant human pathogens\nand diseases specified in German law (IfSG), the RKI receives a\nnotification of new HIV diagnoses. The IfSG enables supplementary\nprojects for the molecular monitoring of circulating pathogens. In this\ncontext, a nationwide network of approximately 70 laboratories \\[ 17 \\]\nreporting 50--60% of all new HIV diagnoses in the country submit plasma\nor serum to the RKI along with the report form for a case. Some\nlaboratories send the sample material on a filter paper (Whatman 903) as\ndried serum or plasma spots. Before genotyping, RNA was extracted from\nthese dried spots as previously described \\[ 15 \\].\n\n### Sample processing, genotypic determination of resistance and subtyping\n\nViral RNA was isolated from the sample material (serum, plasma or spot\nelution) using the automated Biomerieux EasyMag platform. The RNA was\nsubsequently quantified and transcribed into cDNA \\[ 12 \\]. The cDNA\nthen served as a template for the amplification of three regions of the\nHIV genome, which contain all major resistance-associated positions. The\ngenomic regions of protease (PR, amino acids 9--99), reverse\ntranscriptase (RT, amino acids 1-252) and integrase (IN, amino acids\n1-279) were amplified according to previously published protocols \\[ 12\n, 15 \\]. The amplicons were sequenced using an Illumina NGS method\n(MiSeq). Resistance-associated mutations with a cutoff value of 20% were\nrecorded \\[ 12 , 15 \\].\n\nResistance was determined and assessed using the Stanford HIV Drug\nResistance Database version 8.9 algorithm \\[ 18 , 19 \\]. Sequences that\nachieved a mutation penalty score of over 10 (at least low-level\nresistance) were classified as resistant to a therapeutic agent \\[ 18\n\\].\n\nThe subtype of HIV-1 group M viruses was determined using the Stanford\nHIVdB, REGA HIV Subtyping and COMET HIV-1 tools \\[ 20 , 21 \\]. If a\nsubtype or circulating recombinant form (CRF) could not be assigned\nunambiguously, a maximum-likelihood tree with bootstrap (IQ-TREE) was\ncalculated using the HIV-1 subtype reference panel from the Los Alamos\nHIV sequence database \\[ 22 \\]. As in our previous studies \\[ 12 , 15\n\\], only subtype classifications with a bootstrap value of \\> 70% in the\ntree were considered. Otherwise the sequences were classified as unique\nrecombinant forms (URFs).\n\nFor further analysis, the obtained molecular data were combined with\nsociodemographic information from the nameless notification form.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using Excel (chi ^2^ test,\nconfidence intervals) and Stata, version 17.0 (Cochran--Armitage test\nfor trend).\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Proportion of analyzed samples and characteristics of the study population\n\nIn the four-year period from 2017 to 2020, 11,527 new HIV diagnoses were\nreported to the RKI \\[ 14 , 23 \\]. PR and RT sequences were obtained\nfrom 4559 (39.6%) of these new diagnoses \\[ 16 \\]. In 3097 (26.9%) of\nthe reported cases, the relevant IN genome region could also be\namplified and examined in addition (PR, RT, IN) \\[ 16 \\]. The number and\nproportion of reported new diagnoses and the cases with PR/RT and\nPR/RT/IN sequences stratified by gender, transmission route and origin\nof the infected person are shown in Table 1 .\n\n\n### Prevalence and trends of primary resistance among individuals newly diagnosed with HIV-1\n\nOf the 4559 examined sequences of RT and PR genomic regions from newly\ndiagnosed HIV cases, 194 (4.3% \\[95% CI, 3.7; 4.8\\]) demonstrated\nresistance to NRTIs, 420 (9.2% \\[95% CI, 8.4; 10.1\\]) were resistant to\nNNRTIs and 149 (3.3% \\[95% CI, 2.8; 3.8\\]) were resistant to PIs. The\nprevalence of INI resistance was significantly lower at 1.4% (42/3097\n\\[95% CI, 0.9; 1.8\\]) (Table 2 ). In new diagnoses with HIV resistance\nto more than one drug class, NRTI/NNRTI dual resistance was the most\ncommon at 1.2% (53/4559 \\[95% CI, 0.9; 1.5\\]).\n\nAmong the 3097 cases analyzed that had sequence data for PR/RT/IN, the\nproportion of resistant HIV was 15.2% as previously published \\[ 16 \\].\nResistance frequency was similar between males, at 15.1% (388/2575), and\nfemales at 15.7% (81/516) (p = 0.716). HIV resistance to NNRTIs was\nsignificantly (p = 0.004) higher in women than in men, at 11.9% (92/771)\nversus 8.7% (327/3780) (Table 2 ).\n\nStratified by the mode of transmission, we observed a lower prevalence\nof HIV resistance in persons who inject drugs (PWID) (9.6%, 14/146)\ncompared to those with heterosexual transmission (HET) (16.3%, 104/638,\np = 0.041). Compared to HET, HIV resistance to NNRTIs was less common in\nMSM (8.2% vs. 11.8%, p = 0.001), and PI resistance was more common (3.6%\nvs. 2.2%, p = 0.039) (Table 2 ). Moreover, the overall primary HIV\nresistance was not significantly different in persons of German and\nnon-German origin, with 14.8% (268/1817) and 16.3% (167/1025)\n(p = 0.273), respectively. However, resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs was\nless commonly observed among people of German origin (4.1% \\[109/2649\\]\nversus 4.9% \\[73/1499\\], p \\< 0.001 and 8.3% \\[220/2649\\] versus 10.8%\n\\[162/1499\\], p = 0.007) (Table 2 ).\n\nThe prevalence of primary resistance to the four drug classes analyzed\nremained largely constant from 2017 to 2020 (Fig. 1 ).\n\nFig. 1\n\nProportion of primary resistance in the individual drug classes over\ntime. N = 4559 for NRTI, NNRTI and PI; N = 3097 for INI\n\nThe most common resistance-associated mutations were E138A at 3.6%\n(166/4559), resulting in low-level resistance to the NNRTI rilpivirine\n(RPV) and K103NS at 2.9% (133/4559) conferring resistance to NNRTI\nfirst-generation drugs such as efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP)\n(Table 3 ).\n\nK103NS mutations significantly increased from 2.4% (33/1377) to 3.5%\n(33/942) (p ~Trend~ =0.024) (Fig. 2 ) in 2017--2020. T215 revertant\nsubstitutions (T215CDEFISVY), which are considered thymidine analog\nmutations (TAMs) and cause resistance to older NRTIs such as zidovudine\n(AZT) or stavudine (d4T), were also very common at 2.1% (97/4559) (Table\n3 ). Among the key mutations with high relevance for current initial\ntherapies, the non-TAM NRTI substitution M184V was the most common at\n0.6% (27/4559) and reached a proportion of 1% (9/942) in 2020 (Table 3 ;\nFig. 2 ). In particular, this mutation causes high-level resistance to\nemtricitabine (FTC) and lamivudine (3TC). FTC is approved for PrEP in a\ncombination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or tenofovir\ndisoproxil alafenamide (TAF). K65R mutations affecting TDF and TAF were\nat a stable low level of 0.3% and below in 2017--2020 (Fig. 2 ).\n\nFig. 2\n\nPrevalence of five key mutations over the analysis period. Key mutations\ninclude K103NS because of a significant increase and those that\nsubstantially decrease susceptibility to drugs recommended for\nfirst-line therapy in Germany \\[ 4 \\]. N = 4559 for K65R (NRTI), K70E\n(NRTI), M184V (NRTI) and K103NS (NNRTI), N = 3097 for R263K (INI).\n\n### Prevalence of HIV-1 subtypes\n\nBy far, the most common subtype among the 4559 new HIV-1 diagnoses\nanalyzed was subtype B with 58.7%, followed by subtype A (8.4%), the\nrecombinant form CRF02_AG (7.9%) and subtype C (5.2%). Approximately 10%\nof the examined HIV-1 infections were caused by subtypes and recombinant\nforms of which the individual mean prevalence was below 1% (Fig. 3 ).\n\nFig. 3\n\nPrevalence of HIV-1 subtypes among new HIV diagnoses from 2017--2020.\nN = 4559; CRF, circulating recombinant form; cpx, complex\n\nWhile the proportion of subtype B diagnoses fell continuously between\n2017 and 2020 from 60.3 to 55.6% (p ~Trend~ =0.049), the prevalence of\nsubtype variants with frequencies \\< 1% increased from 6.3 to 14.2% (p\n~Trend~ =0.007) (Fig. 4 ).\n\nFig. 4\n\nPrevalence of relevant (\\> 1%) subtypes over the analysis period.\nN = 4559; CRF, circulating recombinant form\n\nSubtype B was highly prevalent in MSM (75.6%) and in newly diagnosed\ncases of German origin (73.0%) (Fig. 5 A). Subtype A, the second most\nfrequent subtype, was common in PWID (27.1%) and CRF02_AG was common in\nHETs (24.7%) (Fig. 5 A). Subtype A dominated cases with origins in\nEastern Europe and Central Asia (52.0%) while CRF02_AG was very frequent\nin cases with origins in Sub-Saharan Africa (40.8%) (Fig. 5 B).\nLow-prevalence subtypes reached high proportions in cases with origins\nin the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific, and the Middle East and North\nAfrica (Fig. 5 B).\n\nFig. 5\n\nPrevalence of subtypes in subgroups.

A molecular surveillance of new HIV diagnoses was\nestablished at the RKI in 2013 to monitor the problem of resistance and\nto analyze the virus variants circulating in Germany \\[ 12 \\]. Primary\nresistance with potential clinical implications was diagnosed in 15.2%\nof the analyzed new cases from 2017 to 2020, as recently reported \\[ 16\n\\]. A similarly high prevalence of 14.5% was found in a pilot study for\nimplementing a Europe-wide surveillance system with new diagnoses from\n2015 in samples from nine countries \\[ 6 \\]. In a comparable study\nbetween 2014 and 2018 in the USA, 18.9% of new HIV diagnoses showed\nresistance mutations \\[ 28 \\].\n\nPrimary resistance to more than one drug class was rare in our survey,\nwith the exception of NRTI/NNRTI dual resistance (1.2%). It was\nsignificantly higher in individuals of non-German origin (1.7%) in\ncontrast to people of German origin 0.9% (p \\< 0.001). Of the 25\nnon-German cases with NRTI/NNRTI dual resistance, 11 were of African\norigin, where NNRTI use is much more common in many countries than in\nGermany \\[ 25 , 29 \\].\n\nApproximately 40% of cases with primary resistance showed reduced\nsusceptibility to older drugs that are rarely used in Germany and that\nare no longer recommended for initial therapy \\[ 4 , 16 , 30 \\]. This\nresistance is primarily based on the TAMs and the polymorphic E138A\nvariant in NRTI resistance and the K103NS mutation in NNRTI resistance.\nThe proportion of these mutations is very consistent over long periods\nof time. This persistence can be largely explained by the level of viral\nfitness deficits. Especially for TAM pattern 2 and K103N mutations, the\ndeficit is very low in comparison to the wild-type virus. \\[ 31 , 32 \\].\nThe prevalence of resistance due to substitutions at the K103 position\nis steadily increasing, a trend that has been observed and analyzed\nsince 2014 in Germany \\[ 15 \\]. Among drugs used in initial regimens,\nmutations that lead to pronounced resistance to the frequently\nprescribed non-TAM NRTIs (especially TDF/TAF, FTC, 3TC, ABC), as well as\nto PIs and INIs, are much more significant \\[ 30 \\]. The frequency of\nthese mutations is much lower and largely stable, ensuring sustained\nefficiency of the currently recommended primary regimens in the near\nfuture. This will be further supported by the approval of new\ntherapeutics.\n\nThe development of primary resistance to TDF/TAF and FTC is particularly\nnoteworthy. These active ingredients are part of many initial therapies\nand are approved for PrEP in Germany. TDF resistance is often caused by\nthe K65R mutation, and FTC resistance is caused by the M184V mutation.\nPreviously, we reported a prevalence of below 0.5% for the K65R and 0.5%\nfor the M184V mutation for 2013--2016 \\[ 15 \\]. The prevalence of these\nmutations in 2017--2020 was again below 0.5% for K65R and 0.6% for M184V\nshowing no significant increase or decrease.\n\nThe analysis of the circulating subtypes revealed that the subtype B\nprevalence continued to decrease to 58.7% on average in the analysis\nperiod. In the four previous years, the proportion was significantly\nhigher at 68.6% \\[ 15 \\], and in 2013--2014, it was 77%. In contrast,\nthe proportion of subtypes and recombinant forms with a prevalence of\n\\< 1% is increasing sharply. Also affected by this trend are new HIV\ninfections among MSM. As a transmission group, MSM still have the\nhighest subtype B prevalence, which is reminiscent for the initial\nspread in the 1980s. The decrease in the proportion of subtype B\ninfections can, at least in part, be explained by the decrease of new\ndiagnoses in the MSM transmission group and the increase of the PWID and\nHET groups in 2017--2020 in Germany \\[ 14 \\]. The declining proportion\namong MSM is associated with an increase in PrEP usage \\[ 7 \\]. As in\nother countries around the world, the HIV-1 epidemic is becoming more\ndiverse in Germany \\[ 12 , 15 , 33 , 34 \\].\n\nThe study is not without limitations. (i) Data reported on the\nnotification form are based on information originally received from the\npatient. Patients can give inaccurate information, particularly\nregarding the mode of transmission or previous HIV diagnoses, to the\ndoctor. (ii) Although, measures for the exclusion of falsely reported\nnew infections are in place (IfSG § 10(4)) we cannot completely rule out\nthat cases of acquired resistance that have already been diagnosed and\ntreated abroad may have been misinterpreted as primary resistance if the\nviral load allows amplification. (iii) Sample material from diagnoses\nthat contain no or very low viral loads leads to deviations in the\nproportion of reported and molecularly analyzed cases. These cases are\nincluded in the report, but most were not included in the molecular\nanalysis. Differences in this regard become particularly clear in the\nstratification according to characteristics (origin, sex, transmission\npath) (Table 1 ). Other reasons for differences cannot be ruled out. Due\nto these limitations, molecular monitoring is not representative of the\nnew HIV diagnoses made in Germany and reported to the RKI. (iv) The\nproportions of successfully amplified integrase regions (largest\namplicon) and analyzed cases for INI resistance are smaller than those\nfor NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs, and the statements are therefore less robust.\n(v) In contrast to the SDRM list utilized in other studies on\ntransmitted resistance mutations, the Stanford HIVdb algorithm we\napplied is regularly updated but includes polymorphisms.\n\nIn conclusion, the proportion of new HIV diagnoses carrying resistance\nassociated mutations to the main drug classes remained largely stable\nfrom 2017 to 2020. The result supports the current recommendations and\nguidelines for genotypic resistance testing, therapy and PrEP. The\nprevalence of subtype B viruses circulating in Germany continues to\ndecrease, and subtype diversity increases. National population-level\nmonitoring of circulating HIV remains critical for informing future\nrecommendations for treatment and prevention as well as for strategies\nto end HIV/AIDS\n\n\n\n## Funding\n\nOpen Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

We determined the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity in Bulgaria during 2012--2020 using polymerase sequences from 1053 of 2010 (52.4%) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. Sequences were analyzed for DRM using the WHO HIV SDRM list implemented in the calculated population resistance tool at Stanford University. Genetic diversity was inferred using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetics. Cluster detection and characterization was performed using MicrobeTrace. The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%). Most (34/60, 56.7%) of the SDRMs were present in transmission clusters of different subtypes composed mostly of male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC), including a 14-member cluster of subtype B sequences from 12 MMSC and two males reporting heterosexual contact; 13 had the L90M PI mutation and one had the T215S NRTI SDRM. We found a low SDRM prevalence amid high HIV-1 diversity among ART-naive patients in Bulgaria during 2012--2020. The majority of SDRMs were found in transmission clusters containing MMSC, indicative of onward spread of SDRM in drug-naive individuals. Our study provides valuable information on the transmission dynamics of HIV drug resistance in the context of high genetic diversity in Bulgaria, for the development of enhanced prevention strategies to end the epidemic.\n\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity using sequences from ART-naive individuals.

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals.

Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon.\nRationale: The paper doest not mention in vitro drug susceptibility data or phenotypic data.

We\nsought to determine the prevalence of FTR resistance-associated\npolymorphisms in HIV-1 subtype C sequences from antiretroviral therapy\n(ART)-naïve and ART-experienced individuals in Botswana. Previously\nreported FTR resistance-associated polymorphisms from literature were\nsurveyed from HIV-1C proviral sequences generated from a large HIV-1\npopulation-based cohort enrolled between 2013 and 2018. Sequences from\nART-naïve and ART-experienced individuals were included in the analysis.\nA total of 6,078 participants with gp120 sequences were included in this\nstudy, and 6,030 (99.2%) had known ART status; 1,282 (21.3%) were from\nART-naïve individuals, while 4,748 (78.7%) were from individuals on ART\nat study enrollment. Viral load (VL) data were available for 4,739\n(99.8%) ART-experienced individuals, of whom 4,526 (95.5%) were\nsuppressed and 213 (4.5%) had virologic failure (VF) (VL \\>400). Among\nthose with VF and ART naive, the overall prevalence of FTR resistance\nwas 13.3% (95% CI 11.6%--15.1%) and did not differ between\nART-experienced with VF individuals (29/213, 13.6%) and ART-naïve\nindividuals (170/1,282, 13.3%) ( *P* -value = 0.9). The most predominant\nmutations (prevalence ≥1.0%) were M434I (9.8%), M475I (5.9%), and M426L\n(1.1%). The overall prevalence of FTR polymorphisms was similar in both\nART-naïve and ART-experienced individuals with VF in a setting with no\nprior FTR exposure. We recommend further studies on the phenotypic\nimpact of these polymorphisms to guide how to monitor for FTR\nresistance. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under\nregistration no. NCT01965470 .)\n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Study design and population\n\nThis is a retrospective cross-sectional study utilizing already\ngenerated 6,078 HIV-1C sequences covering the entire gp120. The\ngenerated sequences were from PWH aged 16--64 years residing in 30\ncommunities in northern, central, and southern parts of Botswana who\nwere randomly selected to participate in the Botswana Combination\nPrevention Project (BCPP) ( 4 , 24 -- 26 ). BCPP enrolled both PWH and\nHIV-negative individuals. HIV-positive status of participants was based\non either written documentation provided (e.g., HIV test results and ART\nprescription) or HIV testing that was performed in the households\naccording to the Botswana national guidelines by using two rapid HIV\ntests in parallel. Most of the ART-experienced PWH were on efavirenz- or\nnevirapine-based ART which was the first-line regimen prior to\ndolutegravir-based first-line ART implementation in June 2016.\n\n### Near full-length HIV genotyping\n\nViral sequences were generated by a long-range HIV genotyping protocol\ndescribed elsewhere ( 24 , 27 ) with minor modifications that included a\nreduced annealing temperature (58 °C instead of 62 °C) as a backup\namplification strategy and using the first-round amplicon as a template\nfor next-generation sequencing (NGS). Proviral DNA templates were used\nfor amplification, as the majority of participants were receiving ART.\nThe NGS was performed by the Biopolimers Facility at Harvard Medical\nSchool ( https://genome.med.harvard.edu/ ) and through collaboration\nwith PANGEA HIV consortium ( 24 ) at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute\n(Cambridge, UK; http://www.sanger.ac.uk/ ) with high-sequencing coverage\nand using Illumina platform MiSeq and HiSeq. A single consensus sequence\nrepresented the population of viral quasispecies per participant.\n\n### Selection of study participants\n\nOnly PWH who were either ART naïve or ART experienced with HIV-1 viral\nload (VL) measurement at the first BCPP study visit and had available\nHIV-1 gp120 sequence were included in the current analysis. HIV-1 VL of\nparticipants was quantified using Abbott m2000sp/rt assay (Wiesbaden,\nGermany) with a range of 40--10 ^7^ copies/mL ( 24 ). ART-experienced\nindividuals were further sub-divided into virally suppressed individuals\nand those with VF. Any VL measurements ≤400 copies/mL were considered as\nviral suppression, while VF was defined as VL \\>400 copies/mL as per\nBotswana ARV treatment guidelines ( 24 ). Figure 1 is a schema used to\nperform data sorting and show a proportion of sequences with missing\nclinical data and was not included in the current analyses.\n\nFig 1\n\nStudy schema for specimen selection. *n* , population size.\n\n### Mutation analysis\n\nA total of 6,078 complete HIV-1C sequences were available for analysis.\nWe used Gene cutter tool (\nhttps://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/GENE_CUTTER/cutter.html ) to\nextract the gp120 fragment of the HIV envelope gene. The obtained\nnucleotides were aligned using NextAlign ( 28 ) and HXB2 as HIV\nreference sequence. The subsequent multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was\nvisually inspected in Aliview before translating to the corresponding\namino acids which was then used for sequence analysis. We developed an\nin-house python script to curate all the mutations within the MSA. The\nwild-type mutations were based on the HXB2. Consequently, the\nfunctionally characterized FTR resistance-associated polymorphisms were\ncurated from different sources and were used to determine the prevalence\nof FTR polymorphisms in the present study ( Table 1 ).\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nThe baseline demographics were summarized using descriptive statistics.\nCategorical variables were reported in percentages while continuous\nvariables in medians with interquartile ranges. Wilcoxon rank-sum test\nwas used to compare continuous variables (VL, age) and chi-square test\nfor categorical variables (district and gender) among these two groups:\n(i) ART naïve and (ii) virologic failure on ART.\n\nThe prevalence of polymorphisms among different groups was estimated\nwith 95% confidence intervals using binomial exact method. The\nprevalence of polymorphisms was compared among groups using comparison\nof proportion test. All the statistical analyses were conducted using\nSTATA version 14 software (Stata Corp LP, College Station, Texas, USA),\nand *P* -value ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Participant characteristics\n\nA total of 6,078 HIV-1 near full length sequences were generated for the\nBCPP study. Of the 6,078 participants with HIV-1 sequences, 48\nparticipants had no ART status and were thus left out from the analysis.\nOf the remaining 6,030 participants, 1,282 participants were ART naïve\nand 4,748 were ART experienced. The ART-experienced participants were\nfurther stratified to ART experienced and virally suppressed (VL ≤400\ncopies/mL) \\[4,526 (95.5%)\\] and ART experienced with VF (detectable VL\n\\>400 copies/mL at entry) \\[213 (4.5%)\\], and nine participants had\nmissing VL data. The analysis here focused on those participants who\nwere ART naïve and those who were ART experienced with VL, giving a\ntotal of 1,495 participants. The median age at enrollment was 34 years\n(Q1, Q3: 27.0, 42.0), 70.8% were female, and the median log10 viral load\nwas 4.23 (Q1, Q3: 3.45, 4.80), and these characteristics had no\nsignificant difference in the ART naïve and ART experienced with VF. The\ndistrict category showed statistical significance with the central\ndistrict having the highest number of individuals.( Table 2 )\n\n\n### Overall prevalence of FTR resistance-associated polymorphisms among ART naïve and individuals experiencing VF on ART\n\nA total of 1,495 participants were analyzed for FTR\nresistance-associated polymorphisms. Of these, 1,282 (85.8%) were ART\nnaïve, while 213 (14.2%) were individuals experiencing VF on ART with\nHIV-1 VL \\>400 copies/mL. The overall prevalence of participants with\nHIV-1 harboring FTR resistance-associated polymorphisms was 199/1,495\n\\[13.3% (95% CI: 11.6--15.1)\\]. By ART status, the prevalence of FTR\nresistance-associated polymorphisms was 171/1,282 \\[13.3% (95% CI:\n11.5--15.3)\\] among ART-naïve individuals and 29/219 \\[13.6% (95% CI:\n9.6--18.9)\\] in those experiencing VF on ART, with no statistically\nsignificant difference ( Fig. 2 ).\n\nFig 2\n\nOverall prevalence of individuals with FTR resistanceassociated\npolymorphisms among ART naïve and individuals experiencing VF on ART.\nThe analysis focused on ART naïve ( *n* = 1,282) and on ART with VF (\n*n* = 213) individuals, total 1,495 individuals, only 199 had FTR\npolymorphisms.\n\n### Overall prevalence of specific FTR resistance-associated polymorphisms in ART naïve and individuals experiencing VF on ART\n\nA total of 32 mutations (all shown in Table S1 ) were found in 979\nindividuals (16.3%), of which three had prevalence \\>1.0%: M475I (5.9%),\nM434I (9.8%), and M426L (1.1%) in Fig. 3 . Among all these mutations,\nM434I was the most frequent polymorphism. When comparing the FTR\nresistance-associated polymorphisms between treatment naive and\ntreatment experienced with VF, only seven were found: A204del, S375T,\nM475I, M434del, M434V, M434I, and M426L. Only M434V was statistically\nsignificantly higher among individuals with VF on ART (1.4%) compared to\n0.2% among ART naïve ( *P* -value = 0.008%) ( Fig. 4 ). Additionally, we\npredicted the tropism of the HIV-1 sequences and observed that R5\ntropism was the most dominant viral tropism with 94.8% among individuals\nwith FTR resistance-associated polymorphisms, the remaining 5.2% were\nCXCR4 tropic and were reported among individuals with VF on ART.\n\nFig 3\n\nOverall prevalence of specific FTR resistance-associated polymorphisms\n(≥ 1.0%). Of the 32 detected amino acid substitutions, only 3 had a\nprevalence (greater than or equal to) 1.0%, these were M475I, M434I, and\nM426L.\n\nFig 4\n\nPrevalence of specific FTR resistance-associated polymorphisms among ART\nnaïve and ART experienced with VF individuals. Of the 32 detected amino\nacid substitutions, 7 were found in both ART naïve and on ART with VF,\nthese were A204del, S375T, M475I, M434del, M434V, M423I, and M426L,\nhaving only M434V being statistically significant between these groups (\n*P* -value \\<0.05%).\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nOur study evaluated the prevalence of pre-existing FTR\nresistance-associated polymorphism in HIV-1 variants from ART-naïve and\nART-experienced PWH with VF in Botswana. We report a similar prevalence\nof FTR resistance-associated polymorphism in HIV-1C from both ART naïve\nand those on ART with VF. Our study is the first to evaluate FTR\nresistance-associated polymorphisms among PWH in Botswana and provides\nguidance on the potential use of this new drug.\n\nThe overall prevalence of FTR polymorphism in this cohort was 13.3%. Our\nfindings are generally consistent with other data regarding FTR\nresistance, with a few differences. The most prevalent polymorphism in\nour study was M475I and M434I (prevalence \\>5.0%), and we observed lower\nfrequency of polymorphisms for M426L (1.1%) and S375T (0.4%) (\\< 5.0%)(\nFig. 5 ). In contrast, other studies have reported S375T as the most\nfrequent amino acid substitution associated with FTR \\[13.21% in the\ndifferent subtypes that were tested (B and non-B) ( 34 ), 17.73% in\nsubtype B ( 18 )\\]. Amino acid substitution M426L was the second most\nfrequent in other studies with 7.56% in subtype B ( 18 ) and 6.8% in\noverall of different subtypes, higher in subtype B (7.9%) than in non-B\nsubtype (4.8%) ( 34 ), these compared to the 1.1% found in this study.\nAmino acid substitutions M434I (9.8%) and M475I (5.9%) were the most\npredominant in the assessed sequences, this prevalence was higher than\nmost reported in other subtypes \\[positions 375, 464, 434, and 475 all\nabove 1% ( 18 , 34 -- 36 )\\]. This also shows that these substitutions\nat positions 434 and 475 are not HIV-1 subtype specific ( 34 , 37 , 38\n). According to Nowicka-Sans et al., based on *in vitro* studies, these\nsubstitutions have a high resistance to temsavir (GSK2616713, formerly\nBMS-626529) of which FTR is its prodrug ( 21 ). To date, all these\nsubstitutions (M426L, S375T, M475I, and M434I) are known to reduce FTR\nsusceptibility both *in vitro* and *in vivo* ( 16 , 21 , 35 , 39 , 40 ).\n\nFig 5\n\nHIV-1 envelope group C amino acid profile. HIV-1 envelope group C amino\nacid profile. The consensus sequence is indicated in black.\nNon-consensus amino acids with prevalence (greater than or equal to)\n5.0%, 1.1%--4.9%, and 0.1%--1.0% are indicated in red, blue, and green,\nrespectively.\n\nWe additionally looked into the group of individuals who were treatment\nexperienced and virally suppressed shown in Table S1 . Their overall\nprevalence of FTR resistance-associated polymorphisms 780/4,526 \\[17.2%\n(95% CI: 16.1--18.3)\\] and when comparing to the 171/1,282 \\[13.3% (95%\nCI: 11.5--15.3)\\] among ART-naïve individuals and the 29/219 \\[13.6%\n(95% CI: 9.6--18.9)\\] in those experiencing VF on ART, there was no\nstatistically significant difference. Though when looking at the\npolymorphisms closely across the ART statuses, amino acid substitutions\nM475I and M434V were significantly higher in the individuals who were\nvirally suppressed on ART than those with VF on ART.\n\nThe study had a good representative sample of PWH in Botswana with a\nlarge data set, which revealed a low prevalence of FTR-associated\nresistance. However, this study had several limitations. It was\ndifficult to pinpoint how each polymorphism affects the efficacy of FTR\nin HIV-1C, as none of the individuals had any exposure to FTR prior to\nthis analysis. Currently, there is no software/database that is used to\npredict the effect of FTR mutations, and the mutations reported were\nbased on the available literature. We, therefore, cannot conclude on how\nmany individuals are susceptible or have intermediate and high-level\nresistance to FTR, although we provide a population-level indication of\npatterns of polymorphisms in FTR-naive individuals in Botswana, which\nprovides a baseline prevalence of possible polymorphisms associated with\nFTR- associated resistance.\n\nThe importance of this study is that despite Botswana and other\ncountries reaching the UNAIDS 95-95-95 goals ( 3 ) and having high ART\ncoverage, drug resistance mutations pose a threat to the efficiency of\nART ( 3 -- 7 ). There are reports of individuals harboring HIV-1\nvariants with resistance to most of the available ARVs in Botswana and\nother countries in SSA ( 8 -- 10 ). Thus, FTR can be a potential option\nalong with other ARVs to treat PWH who are failing regimens containing\ncurrent ARVs. Our study shows potential for the use of FTR in this\nsetting as we find similar prevalence of FTR resistance-associated\npolymorphisms in both ART naïve and individuals on ART with VF with no\nprior FTR exposure. We recommend further studies on the phenotypic\nimpact of these polymorphisms are warranted to guide how to monitor for\nFTR resistance.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 35838991\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Methods: We evaluated the prevalence of low-frequency DRMs among cART-naïve individuals previously sequenced using Sanger sequencing. The generated pol amplicons were sequenced by next-generation sequencing.\nResults: We observed low-frequency DRMs (detected at <20% in 33/103 (32%) of the successfully sequenced individuals, of whom four also had mutations detected at >20%. K65R was the most common low-frequency DRM detected in 8 individuals. Eighty-two of the 103 individuals had follow-up viral load data while on cART. Twenty-seven of the 82 individuals harbored low-frequency DRMs. Only 12 of 82 individuals experienced VF. The following low-frequency DRMs were observed in four individuals experiencing VF: K65R, K103N, V108I, and Y188C. No statistically significant difference was observed in the prevalence of low-frequency DRMs between individuals experiencing VF (4/12) and those not experiencing VF (23/70) (P = .97). However, individuals with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors-associated low-frequency DRMs were 2.68 times more likely to experience VF (odds ratio, 2.68; 95% confidential interval, 0.4–13.9) compared with those without (P = .22).\nRationale: The paper focuses on the sequencing and detection of low-frequency drug resistance mutations in HIV-1 from patient samples.

To do this,\ntemsavir relies on the presence of a residue with small side chain at\nposition 375 in Env and is unable to neutralize viral strains like\nCRF01_AE carrying His375. Here we investigate the mechanism of temsavir\nresistance and show that residue 375 is not the sole determinant of\nresistance. At least six additional residues within the gp120 inner\ndomain layers, including five distant from the drug-binding pocket,\ncontribute to resistance. A detailed structure-function analysis using\nengineered viruses and soluble trimer variants reveals that the\nmolecular basis of resistance is mediated by crosstalk between His375\nand the inner domain layers. Furthermore, our data confirm that temsavir\ncan adjust its binding mode to accommodate changes in Env conformation,\na property that likely contributes to its broad antiviral activity.\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Resistance of CRF01_AE strains to temsavir is mediated by His375 and residues in the inner domain layers\n\nTo identify Env features conferring resistance to temsavir, we\nreanalyzed the neutralization sensitivity data previously published by\nPancera et al. ^^13^^ . These data were reanalyzed with a focus on the\nclade or the identity of the polymorphic residues in the gp120 Phe43\ncavity. Temsavir has been reported to be active against 91% of a panel\nof 208 HIV-1 Envs from different clades tested in this study (Fig. 1a ),\nmatching the breadth of the broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) VRC01\n^^13^\\ ,\\ ^40^^ . As expected, most strains with complete resistance to\ntemsavir belonged to the CRF01_AE subtype. This resistance has been\npreviously attributed to the presence of the naturally occurring residue\nHis375, which directly interferes with the docking of temsavir-like\nmolecules to the Phe43 cavity ^^36^^ . Most sensitive HIV-1 strains on\nthe other hand harbor much smaller residues at this position, either\nSer375 or Thr375, which can accommodate the temsavir phenyl ring (Fig.\n1b ). Interestingly, uncommon amino acids at residue 375 are also found\nin a small subset of strains, including Asn375 or Met375, which also\nseem to render Env more resistant to temsavir's activity. To confirm\nthese observations, we mutated residue 375 of the clade B tier-2 JR-FL\nEnv by a series of amino acids ranging from small (Ser and Thr) to\nintermediate (Asn and Met) to more bulky sidechain residues (Phe, Tyr,\nHis, Trp). Using a single round neutralization assay, we observed that\nthe activity of temsavir inversely correlated with the size of residue\n375 (Fig. 1c ). This was supported by the results of a soluble CD4\n(sCD4) competition assay, where temsavir inhibited Env-CD4 interactions\nmore efficiently in the presence of smaller 375 residues (Fig. 1d ).\nConversely, mutating the highly conserved His375 in CRF01_AE strains\nback to Ser or Thr did not restore temsavir sensitivity, suggesting that\nadditional Env residues are involved in CRF01_AE resistance to temsavir\n(Fig. 2b--e ).\n\nFig. 1\n\n**Intrinsic resistance of HIV-1 CRF01_AE strains to neutralization by\nattachment inhibitor temsavir.**\n\n**a** , **b** The ability of temsavir to neutralize viral particles from\na panel of 208 different strains was previously reported by Pancera et\nal. ^^13^^ .

Statistical significance was\ntested using a two-tailed unpaired *t* -test. Source data are provided\nas a Source Data file.\n\nWe recently identify a set of six residues within the gp120 inner domain\nLayers 1, 2 and 3 (at Env position 61, 105, 108, 474, 475, and 476) that\ncoevolved with residue 375 to facilitate interaction with CD4 ^^38^^ .\nThese residues were also shown to be involved in Env sensitivity to\nsmall molecules targeting the CD4-binding site such as CD4 mimetic\ncompounds (CD4mc), cyclic peptide triazoles and CD4-binding site\nantibodies ^^39^^ . Since some of these residues are proximal to the\ntemsavir binding pocket, we sought to determine if they also contributed\nto temsavir resistance. We reanalyzed the neutralization results\nreported by Pancera et al. ^^13^^ . and noticed that residues His61,\nGln105, Val108, Asn474, Ile475, and Lys476 were all associated with\nhigher resistance to temsavir-mediated neutralization (Fig. 2a ). It is\nimportant to highlight that these changes are usually found in CRF01_AE\nstrains, where they coevolved to accommodate the presence of His375 by\nreshaping the Phe43 cavity and CD4 binding site ^^38^\\ ,\\ ^39^^ .\nTherefore, we mutated these six residues in two CRF01_AE Envs (92TH023\nand CM244) to harbor residues associated with higher temsavir\nsensitivity (His61Tyr, Gln105His, Val108Ile, Asn474Asp, Ile475Met,\nLys476Arg; collectively referred to as Layer Mutations or LM). The\nmutations were introduced in combination with changes at position 375.\nThe sensitivity of CRF01_AE Env to temsavir neutralization was only\nrestored when the six-layer mutations were combined with a small residue\nat position 375, i.e. Ser or Thr (LMHS or LMHT) (Fig. 2b--e ).\nConversely when clade B Env YU2 residues were changed to CRF01_AE\ncounterparts (Tyr61His, His105Gln, Ile108Val, Asp474Asn, Met475Ile,\nArg476Lys), we observed an increased resistance to temsavir, especially\nin combination with the Ser375His change (LMSH), confirming the role of\nthese layer residues in modulating the temsavir sensitivity of Env (Fig.\n2f, g ). Among them, layer 3 residues (474, 475 and 476) appear to\ncontribute the most to temsavir neutralization resistance (Fig ^S1^ ).\n\n### Effect of temsavir on CRF01_AE Env conformation\n\nOur mutagenesis and temsavir sensitivity studies confirmed the\nrequirement of mutations of both the His375 to Ser or Thr within the\nPhe43 cavity and the LM residues for restoration of temsavir sensitivity\nto CRF01_AE. In order to understand the molecular basis of the observed\ncooperativity between the Phe43 cavity and the LM residues for temsavir\nbinding, we introduced the LMHS modifications into the previously\ndescribed CRF01_AE T/F100 SOSIP.664 trimer ^^41^^ . This Env was derived\nfrom a transmitted/founder CRF01_AE strain isolated from participant\n40100 of the RV217 Early Capture HIV Cohort Study conducted in Thailand\n^^42^^ .\n\nTo characterize the structural changes induced by the LMHS mutations, we\ndetermined the Cryo-EM structures of wild type CRF01_AE T/F100 SOSIP.664\nand its LMHS mutant unbound and bound to temsavir (Supplementary Figs.\n^S2^ -- ^S4^ , Supplementary Table ^S1^ ). To allow for an unbiased\nanalysis of the structural changes induced by the LMHS mutations and/or\nthe binding of temsavir, we determined each structure with the same set\nof chaperone antibody Fabs from the 8ANC195 and 10--1074 bnAbs. In\naddition, to allow for a more unbiased comparison of the temsavir\nbinding pocket formed within the LHMS CRF01_AE T/F100 to the pockets of\nother clades we also solved a temsavir-bound Clade A BG505 SOSIP.664\nCryo-EM structure with the same set of chaperones Fabs (Supplementary\nFigs. ^S6^ and ^S7^ ). The only other temsavir bound-BG505 SOSIP.664\ncomplex was solved by X-Ray crystallography using the chaperone Fabs of\nPGT122 and 35022 ( PDB: 5U7O ^^13^^ ). With these two chaperone Fabs, we\nwere able to get relatively high-resolution structures of the trimer\nincluding a structure of the temsavir bound-T/F100 LMHS SOSIP.664 and\ntemsavir bound-BG505 SOSIP.664 complex to 3.1 Å and 3.0 Å resolution\nrespectively, where the densities for temsavir were well defined\nenabling us to make an unambiguous placement of the compound. In Fig. 3\nwe show the three structures with chaperone bound Fabs along with the\nchanges to the overall assembly of the trimer and calculate the degree\nof trimer opening as defined in Tolbert et al. ^^43^^ . which describes\nthe changes to the distances between residues at position 375 (a, b, c)\nand the calculated center of the gp41 portion of the trimer (d, e, f).\nThe degree of opening is then defined relative to the closed unliganded\nBG505 trimer ( PDB ID: 4ZMJ ). The structural alignments indicate no\nsignificant changes to the overall conformation of the T/F100 LMHS\nSOSIP.664 mutant as compared to its wild type counterpart. We measured\nsimilar distances between residues 375 and similar degrees of opening\n(Fig. 3b and c ). Furthermore, both structures could be superimposed\nwith an RMSD value of 1.18 Å for the main chain atoms of the trimer.\nInterestingly, both the wild type T/F100 SOSIP.664 and its LMHS mutant\nappear to be slightly 'more open' than the Clade A, BG505 SOSIP.664 used\nhere as a reference (the rotation/opening angles are 3.28° and 3.39° for\nwild type and LMHS mutant T/F100 SOSIP.664 respectively, Fig. 3b, c ).\nThis indicates a greater propensity of CRF01_AE T/F100 trimers to sample\n'open' conformations, a property suggested previously to be a hallmark\nof CRF01_AE strains ^^37^\\ ,\\ ^39^\\ ,\\ ^44^^ . Binding of temsavir to\nT/F100 LMHS SOSIP.664 induced a further opening of the trimer as\nindicated by a rotation angle of 4.92° in the temsavir bound LMHS\nSOSIP.664. Furthermore, the temsavir- T/F100 LMHS SOSIP.664 trimer is\nopen by 1.4° more than the temsavir-BG505 SOSIP.664 determined in this\nstudy and about 3.4° more than the temsavir-BG505 SOSIP.664 complex\ndetermined previously ( PDB 5U7O , Fig. 3b, c ). The differences in the\nangle opening between the two temsavir-BG505 SOSIP.664 complexes could\npossibly be attributed to the different chaperone Fabs sets used to\ndetermine both structures or to the influence of crystal packing in the\nlatter structure determined by x-ray crystallography (Fig. 3b, c ).\nHowever, the angle of opening for the temsavir bound LMHS SOSIP.664 was\nsignificantly lower than that observed for fully open, CD4-triggered Env\n(the angle of rotation/opening is 18.29° for the CD4 bound BG505\nSOSIP.664, Fig. 3c ).\n\nFig. 3\n\n**Structure of an engineered CRF01_AE SOSIP.664 Env trimer in complex\nwith temsavir.**\n\n**a** Overall structures of trimers complexed with chaperone Fabs of\n10--1074 and 8ANC195 antibodies shown as cartoon with LMHS mutations\nhighlighted in red within one gp120 promoter.

The relative position for each gp120\nin the trimer is calculated based on the α-carbon position for residue\n375 at the base of the CD4 Phe43 binding pocket (shown as colored\nspheres for each structure) relative to the gp41 trimer center (gray\nsphere, Centr, calculated for all trimers aligned based on the α-carbon\npositions of the central gp41 α7 helices). The distances between Centr\nand the ^375^ Cα of each protomer ( **a** -- **c** ) and the ^375^ Cα\natoms of neighboring protomers ( **d** -- **f** ) are shown to indicate\nthe extent of the protomer rearrangement relative to gp41. The clockwise\nrotations of the gp120 subunits are calculated as angles relative to apo\nBG505 SOSIP (shown and labeled a-a', b-b', and c-c'). The BG505\nSOSIP.664 bound to CD4 ( PDB: 5THR ^^78^^ ) is shown as a reference to\nthe 'open' CD4-triggered conformation of trimer. c Table summarizing\n**a** -- **f** distances and a-a', b-b' and c-c' rotation angles for\nCRF01_AE\\_ T/F100 SOSIP.664 complex variants relative to the unbound\nBG505 SOSIP trimer ( PDB: 4ZMJ ^^77^^ ).\n\nWe then aligned and compared the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD)\nvalues of the three CRF01_AE T/F100 trimers as follows: 1) CRF01_AE\nT/F100 SOSIP.664 wild type and its LMHS mutant and 2) LMHS mutant apo\nand its temsavir bound counterpart (Supplementary Fig. ^S8^ ). We\nobserved more pronounced differences within regions of the gp120 inner\ndomain Layers 1, 2 and 3, the α5 helix, the β20-β21 loop and regions\nneighboring the fusion peptide (Supplementary Figs. ^S5^ and ^S8^ ).\nInterestingly, similar to the pattern observed for the opening of the\ntrimer, the most pronounced differences in RMSD values in these regions\nwere observed for the unliganded LMHS SOSIP.664 and its temsavir-bound\ncounterpart (RMSD value of 1.40 Å for the whole trimer) and not wild\ntype T/F100 SOSIP.664 and its LMHS mutant counterpart (RMSD value of\n1.18 Å). While the changes observed for Layers 1, 2 and 3 map to regions\nwhere the LM mutations were introduced, the β20-β21 loop and the fusion\npeptide regions sit away from the mutation sites suggesting that their\nchanges could be allosteric. In particular, the conformation of the\nregion preceding the fusion peptide in the temsavir bound T/F100 LMHS\nSOSIP.664 differs significantly from the unliganded T/F100 LMHS\nSOSIP.664 and the wild type T/F100 SOSIP.664. Interestingly, in our\nstructures of CRF01_AE T/F100 SOSIP.664 variants, the gp41 experimental\ndensities of the region around the fusion peptide were not well defined.\nAlmost half of the fusion peptide (residues 514--527) was not resolved\nand is missing in the three structures as compared to the structure of\nwild type T/F100 SOSIP.664 described in a previous study ^^41^^\n(Supplementary Fig. ^S5^ ). In addition, there is conformational\nheterogeneity among our structures in the region forming the fusion\npeptide proximal region (FPPR, residues 528--540) and the N-terminal\nregion of heptad repeat 1 (HR1 ~N,~ residues 541--548). Furthermore, in\nthe temsavir-bound LMHS mutant structure, part of the FPPR and HR1 ~N~\nregions were more exposed to solvent and sequestered within the\nhydrophobic core to lesser extent than in the wild type and unbound LMHS\ntrimer (Supplementary Figs. ^S5^ and ^S8a^ ).\n\n### The LM residues are central to the interaction network controlling movement of the β20--β21 loop\n\nAs described previously for the Clade A BG505 trimer ^^13^^ , the\ntemsavir binding pocket is located at the interface between the gp120\ninner and outer domains of the CRF01_AE T/F100 LMHS SOSIP.664 and it is\ngated by the mobility of β20--β21 loop of gp120. As shown in Fig. 4 the\nintroduced LM mutations map to the α5 helix of the inner domain Layer 3\n(Asn474Asp, Ile475Met and Lys476Arg), the α1 helix of the inner domain\nLayer 2 (Gln105His, Val108Ile), and the loop connecting β2 (minus)\nstrand and α0 helix of the inner domain Layer 1 (His61Tyr). While the\nLayer 1 His61Tyr mutation is located distal from the temsavir binding\npocket and most likely has no effect on compound binding, the Layer 2\nand Layer 3 mutations are required for temsavir binding pocket formation\nand temsavir binding. In the wild type CRF01_AE T/F100, Gln105 is in the\ncenter of a hydrogen bond network that stabilizes the mobile β20--β21\nloop of gp120 in the conformation that blocks the entry to the temsavir\nbinding pocket (Fig. 4b ). There is an H-bond formed between the amide\non Gln105, the backbone of Lys476 and the side chain indole of Trp427\nthat 'locks' Trp427 in the orientation permitting hydrophobic packing of\nTrp427 with surrounding residues, Trp69, Val108, Pro253, Val255 and\nTrp479. Therefore, Gln105 serves as a double-sided lock that holds both\nthe β20-β21 loop and the α5 helix in place. Replacement of Gln105 to\nHistidine in the LMHS mutant eliminates this H-bond network and thus\n'frees' the side chain indole of Trp427 which is less constrained in its\nhydrophobic environment permitting free movement of the β20--β21 loop.\nIn addition, without the double-side lock (Gln105), LM mutations within\nthe α1 helix (Layer 2) and the α5 helix (Layer 3) form a different\nnetwork of H-bonds (Fig. 4b , center zoom-in window). The side chain of\nArg476 (Layer 3) sits in the center of the network and makes contacts to\nboth Glu102 (Layer 2) and Asp474 (Layer 3). These interactions stabilize\ninterlayer contacts adjacent to the entrance of the temsavir pocket and\ncoordinate with the Gln105His mutation in 'loosening up' Trp427 and\nallowing β20--β21 loop mobility. As reported previously ^^13^^ , the\nβ20--β21 loop mobility is essential for the formation of the temsavir\nbinding pocket. Indeed, in the temsavir bound LMHS complex, the\nconformation of the β20--β21 loop changes significantly as compared to\nthe unliganded LMHS structure with the loop needing to move away to\naccommodate temsavir (Fig. 4b ). β20--β21 loop movement can be measured\nby the changes in the position of Trp427 at the entry of the temsavir\nbinding pocket, 3.1 Å and 5.7 Å as calculated between the Cα and Cγ\npositions for the unliganded and bound complexes respectively.\nInterestingly, in the temsavir bound LMHS complex, the β20--β21 loop\ncaps the temsavir in its pocket from the top and Trp427 directly lines\nthe pocket with its side chain indole making contacts to the compound's\npiperazine group to lock the compound in its bound conformation.\nAltogether, our data indicate that the LM mutations 'pre-shape' HIV-1\nEnv to accommodate temsavir in its binding pocket, directly contributing\nto the conformation of the Env trimer by stabilizing the inner domain\ninterface between Layers 2 and 3 in the area proximal to the binding\npocket and gating β20--β21 loop movement.\n\nFig. 4\n\n**The LMHS mutations' induced changes to the temsavir binding pocket.**\n\n**a** Insights into regions forming the temsavir binding pocket.

The blow-up views show the network of\ninteractions mediated by LMHS residues at the 'entry' of the temsavir\nbinding pocket and the neighboring β20-β21 loop. Hydrogen bonds are\nshown as dashed blue lines.\n\n### The temsavir binding pocket within the CRF01_AE T/F100 LMHS Env involves both conserved and new elements of the gp120 inner and outer domains\n\nThe overall properties of the temsavir binding pocket in T/F100 LMHS\nSOSIP.664 and the BG505 SOSIP.664 are shown in Fig. 5 . The α1, α3, and\nα5 helices and the β16 sheet border the pocket and the β20--β21 loop\n\"gates\" the pocket in both structures. In addition, the same set of\ntwenty-four gp120 residues line the pocket in both structures (as listed\nin Fig. 5c i.e. gp120 residues 108-109, 112-113, 116-117, 200, 202,\n255-256, 370, 375--377, 382, 384, 424--427, 432--434, and 475). Only two\nof these residues constitute substitutions introduced by the LMHS\nmutations in T/F100 SOSIP, His375Ser and Ile475Met (Fig. 5b ).\nStructural superimpositions with the wild type T/F100 SOSIP\nunequivocally confirm that the large side chain of His375 represents the\nmajor obstacle in the temsavir binding by causing a direct steric clash\nto the main anchoring region of the compound 'head' phenyl moiety. The\nsubstitution of His375 with a small side chain residue, serine,\nmitigates these clashes and is required for the binding of the compound\n(the BSA of Ser375 alone in the temsavir T/F100 LMHS SOSIP.664 complex\nis around 9 Å). Furthermore, the LM mutation Ile475Met introduces an\nimportant hydrophobic contact to temsavir; Met475 alone contributes more\nthan 20 Å ^2^ of BSA to the compound-SOSIP interface. Ile475 is one of\nthe most resistant substitutions in native T/F100 Env, reportedly\naccounting for \\~90 fold reduction in temsavir activity ^^13^^ , and has\nbeen confirmed clinically as a major contributor to reduced temsavir\nsusceptibility for the CRF01_AE subtype ^^25^^ . As with residues lining\nthe temsavir binding pocket, only one residue in the β3 sheet at\nposition 202 differs between the T/F100 LMHS and BG505 SOSIP.664 (a\nlysine versus threonine). This residue caps the binding pocket in the\nregion that accommodates the 'tail' methyltriazole ring.\n\nFig. 5\n\n**Temsavir binding pocket.**\n\n**a** Temsavir in its binding pocket within the CRF01_AE\\_ T/F100 LMHS\nSOSIP.664.

BSA values represent\nthe average of the three copies in the trimer. The conservation of\nresidues lining the temsavir pocket is shown at the bottom. The height\nof the residue at each position is proportional to its frequency of\ndistribution among the HIV-1 isolates, as deposited in the Los Alamos\nHIV database (all clades are included). Residues are colored according\nto hydrophobicity: black - hydrophobic, green - neutral, blue -\nhydrophilic. **d** Close-up views of the extended tails on the thiazole\nring from the two temsavir analogues whose structures have been\ndetermined ( PDB: 6MU6 and 6MU7 ) ^^14^^ .\n\nThe conformations of temsavir in the T/F100 LMHS and BG505 binding\npockets resemble each other relatively well with an almost identical\nconformation and position of the core region, i.e. the\npiperazine-oxoacetyl-methyl pyrrolo-pyridine moiety, and more noticeable\ndifferences in the conformations of the 'head' benzoyl moiety and the\n'tail' methyltriazole ring (Fig. 5b ). In the core region, two hydrogen\nbonds are formed between pocket residues Asp113 and Trp427 to the\npyridine and the oxoacetyl group of temsavir, respectively, and are\npresent in both structures (Fig. 5a ). In addition, the core is\nstabilized in both complexes by hydrophobic contacts from Met426,\nTrp112, Ile424 and Met434 (Fig. 5 ). Whereas the temsavir core regions\nlargely overlap, the 'tail' methyltriazole ring is flipped when bound to\nT/F100 SOSIP as compared to BG505 SOSIP, which places the methyl group\noriented towards the β13 sheet instead of the C-terminus of the α1 helix\n(Fig. 5b , zoom-in view). This different orientation is most likely a\nresult of the Lys202 side chain which is the only pocket residue that is\ndifferent between T/F100 LMHS and BG505. In BG505, the threonine side\nchain at position 202 blocks the path for the extension of the\nBMS-626529 'tail' toward the β13 sheet while a larger but more flexible\nlysine side chain allows the methyltriazole ring to adopt conformation\nwith its methyl group 'up'. Interestingly, two recently reported\ntemsavir derivatives, BMS-814508 and BMS-818251, which show 4- and\n\\~100-fold greater inhibition than temsavir against a laboratory-adapted\nNL4-3 HIV-1 strain, respectively, have a thiazole ring and longer\nhydrophilic tails in the place of the methyltriazole in temsavir ^^14^^\n. Both temsavir-analogs-bound BG505 SOSIP structures ( PDB: 6MU6 and\n6MU7 ) demonstrate that the extended tails of both inhibitors orient\ntoward the α1 helix instead of the β13 sheet. Given that BMS-818251 has\nalso been reported to have improved inhibition against CRF01_AE strains\nwith IC ~50~ values ranging from 32--733 nM as compared to IC ~50~\n\\> 5.8 μM for temsavir ^^14^^ , it would be worthwhile to determine the\nconformation of the extended C-terminal 'tail' that BMS-818251 adopts\nwhen bound to T/F100 LMHS to see if Lys202 plays the role of 'gate\nkeeper' for BMS-818251 and forces different conformations for the tail\nin this region.\n\nThe noticeable differences in the conformation of the temsavir 'tail'\nregion are coupled with changes to the orientation of the 'head' phenyl\nmoiety in the T/F100 LMHS SOSIP.664 complex as compared to the\ntemsavir-bound BG505 SOSIP.664 (Fig. 5b ). In the T/F100 LMHS complex,\nthe phenyl ring of temsavir is tilted approximately 0.8--1.0 Å toward\none edge of the pocket and packs more tightly with Phe382, Tyr384 and\nIle424. We speculate that the shift of the phenyl ring in the pocket\nresults from the side chain movements of Val255, Phe382 and Trp427 and\nthe backbone rearrangement of the β16 sheet as compared to the\nconformation of this region in BG505 SOSIP. As a result, there is a\nstrong, approximately 4 Å, face-to-edge π-π interaction between Phe382\nand the temsavir phenyl ring. Concomitantly, the backbone movement of\nthe β16 sheet is likely required to allow temsavir to bind to T/F100\nLMHS SOSIP.664 and accommodate its phenyl ring. Interestingly,\nsuperimposition of the temsavir-bound T/F100 SOSIP.664 with BMS-814508\nand BMS-818251 bound BG505 SOSIP.664 suggest that replacement of the\nacetyl group by a nitrile in the latter two temsavir derivatives does\nnot result in a shift of the temsavir phenyl ring. Altogether, this data\nindicates that the binding mode of temsavir to Env may differ among\ndifferent HIV-1 strains, with polymorphic Env residues and Env\nconformational flexibility forcing changes in the orientation of both\n'head and tail' regions of temsavir. These variables should be\nconsidered in the structure-based development of more potent and broader\ntemsavir-like attachment inhibitors, as has been previously done with\nother classes of HIV-1 inhibitors ^^45^\\ --\\ ^51^^ .\n\nDespite the observed conformational differences of temsavir within the\nT/F100 LMHS SOSIP.664 and BG505 SOSIP.664 binding cavities, the Env\nresidues contributing to temsavir binding are highly conserved. Using\nresidue BSA to stratify residue contribution to the interface, temsavir\nmostly relies on interactions to Env residues that are strictly\nconserved in over 99% of HIV-1 sequences (residues Trp112, Leu116,\nPhe382, and Trp427, Fig. 5c ), highly conserved with approximately 97%\nor more of HIV-1 sequences (residues Asp113, Lys117, and Val255) or\nconserved with limited sequence variation (residues Thr/Lys202,\nIle/Val424, Met/Arg/Leu426, Lys/Gln/Arg432 and Met/Ile475). The high\ndegree of conservation implies that Env is only able to tolerate limited\nsequence diversity at these positions. Temsavir can accommodate many of\nthese changes. The Thr202Lys change can be accommodated by a\nrearrangement of the methyltriazole ring in temsavir as mentioned\npreviously. Asp113 which is involved in one of the two hydrogen bonds\nwith temsavir is rarely any other residue, but the infrequently seen\nGlu113 or Asn113 can also form a hydrogen bond with temsavir. The\nresidue at position 424 contributes to the binding pocket through van\nder Waals interactions that can be made equally well by different\nresidues (i.e. Ile or Val). Other key interactions with temsavir are\ndependent on main chain atoms such as Lys/Gln/Arg432 or the hydrogen\nbond between Trp427 and temsavir. One of the few temsavir pocket residue\nsequence changes that can influence temsavir binding is His at position\n375. Temsavir resistance in many other cases is likely to come from\nconformational changes induced by residue changes outside of the binding\npocket.\n\n### Temsavir induced changes to the bnAb binding interface\n\nWe obtained structures of CRF01_AE\\_ T/F100 SOSIP.664 variants with two\nchaperone bnAbs: 8ANC195 and 10--1074. It was suggested previously that\ntemsavir can synergize with the CD4 binding site (CD4bs)-targeting bnAbs\nin neutralizing HIV-1 strains including strains with resistance\nconferring mutations ^^52^^ . However, a recent study failed to provide\nevidence of synergy among these bnAbs and temsavir. Temsavir treatment\nof Env expressing cells significantly decreased the binding of most\nbnAbs ^^53^^ .\n\nOur structural studies of CRF01_AE\\_ T/F100 LMHS SOSIP.664 with or\nwithout temsavir with the same set of 8ANC195 and 10--1074 Fabs\npermitted us to evaluate if there were differences in the bnAb--Env\nbinding interface induced by temsavir. Since all structures were solved\nat similar overall resolution, direct comparisons among complexes were\npossible for interfaces' details and BSA. Figure 6 shows the molecular\ndetails of the bnAb interface of 8ANC195 and 10--1074 bound to\nCRF01_AE\\_ T/F100 SOSIP.664 variants. While total BSA for 8ANC195 and\n10--1074 interfaces for wild type CRF01_AE\\_ T/F100 SOSIP.644 are 5915 Å\n^2^ and 1848 Å ^2^ , respectively, they change to 5920 Å ^2^ and 2171 Å\n^2^ for the unbound LMHS SOSIP and 5536 Å ^2^ and 1680 Å ^2^ for the\ntemsavir-bound LMHS SOSIP (Supplementary Table ^S2^ ). In addition,\nalthough specific Fab-Env contacts remain largely unchanged in both\ncomplexes (Fig. 6b ), the interfaces for the bnAbs form with smaller BSA\nfor both Env antigen and antibody residues (Fig. 6a, c , Supplementary\nTable ^S2^ ). When 10--1074 interacts with temsavir-bound T/F100 LMHS\nSOSIP.644, the overall contribution of the gp120 Asn332 glycan to the\ninterface is significantly lower than in the unbound LMHS SOSIP.644\ncomplex (BSA of 459 Å ^2^ as compared to 728 Å ^2^ ). In addition,\n10--1074 depends significantly less on the light chain contacts in the\ntemsavir-bound T/F100 LMHS SOSIP.644 as compared to the unbound one\n(Supplementary Table ^S2^ ). Overall, as described before ^^13^^ , the\n10--1074 footprint on Env is very small, and the main interaction is\nmediated by the extended CDR H3 of this bnAb. Differences in the 8ANC195\ninterface BSA between the temsavir-bound and unbound complexes is less\npronounced but still noticeable. 8ANC195 recognizes an epitope at the\ngp120-gp41 junction (Fig. 6b, c ), splitting the interface BSA between\nboth Env protomers with a larger contribution to the gp41 subunit.\n8ANC195, similar to 10--1074, relies less on binding to temsavir-bound\nT/F100 LMHS SOSIP.644 glycans as compared to unbound SOSIP (BSA of 1774\nÅ ^2^ as compared to 1844 Å ^2^ ) and forms a complex with significantly\nlower BSA of heavy and light chain residues (2579 Å ^2^ as compared 2761\nÅ ^2^ , Supplementary Table ^S2^ ). Although the exact mechanism causing\nthe differences in the bNAb complex BSA between temsavir-bound and\nunbound T/F100 LMHS SOSIP.644 remains difficult to pinpoint, it can be\nhypothesized that these differences are induced by changes in the\noverall trimer conformation upon temsavir binding in the CRF01_AE Env.\nWhether temsavir-induced changes to the overall stability of bnAb-Env\ncomplexes hold for other HIV-1 clades remains to be shown. Furthermore,\nthe modulation of bnAb binding by temsavir is most likely to be epitope\ndependent.\n\nFig. 6\n\n**Comparisons of the 10--1074 and 8ANC195 binding interfaces formed with\nCRF01_AE\\_ T/F100 SOSIP.664 wild type and its LMHS mutant unbound or\nbound to temsavir.**\n\n**a** , **c** Buried Surface Area (BSA) contributed by individual\nresidues of Env and the Fabs of 10--1074 ( **c** ) and 8ANC195 ( **b** )\nin apo CRF01_AE\\_ T/F100 LMHS SOSIP.664 and CRF01_AE\\_ T/F100 LMHS\nSOSIP.664 bound to temsavir. The total Env glycan contribution to the\ninterface is shown as a separate bar with the value of BSA shown at the\ntop. BSA values represent the average of the three copies in the trimer.\n**b** Superimposition of the complexes with 10--1074 and 8ANC195 colored\ngreen, yellow and gray for wild-type CRF01_AE\\_ T/F100 SOSIP.664, and\nits apo and temsavir-bound LMHS mutant complexes, respectively. Blow-ups\nshow similarities/differences between the complexes of how individual\nFab/antibody residues interact with the Env antigen.\n\nFinally, we noticed changes to the mode of binding of the V3\nglycan-targeting 10--1074 bnAb to the CRF01_AE\\_ T/F100 SOSIP.664 as\ncompared to Clade A BG505 (Supplementary Fig. ^S9^ ). 10--1074 locks the\nEnv trimer in a CD4-incompetent closed conformation but the only\navailable 10--1074 bnAb-Env complex structure is of 10--1074 Fab bound\nto BG505 SOSIP.664 ^^13^^ . Structural comparisons indicate that\n10--1074 interacts with T/F100 SOSIP.664 in a different manner compared\nto the BG505 SOSIP.664, despite the majority of interacting CDRH3\nresidues adopting a similar backbone trace in both SOSIP.664 s. As an\nexample, Glu100I in CDRH3 (Kabat residue numbering ^^54^^ ) forms two\npolar interactions with Arg327 and Gln328 of BG505 gp120, while this\nsame glutamate side chain points outward without making any close\ncontact with the V3 residues in the in the T/F100 SOSIP.664 structure.\nInstead, Tyr100B forms a sole hydrogen bond with Arg327 between the\n10--1074 heavy chain and T/F100 SOSIP.664. Strikingly, unlike the V1\nloop of BG505-SOSIP.664 that engages closely with the 10--1074 light\nchain, the T/F100 Env V1 loop with 10 more residue-insertions as\ncompared to BG505 remains largely disordered and barely interacts with\nthe light chain of 10--1074. Although high anisotropy limits the local\nresolution at the 10--1074-gp120 interface, the Asn332 glycan is well\ndefined, and it is interactions with this carbohydrate that are major\ndeterminants for binding for PGT121-like and 10--1074-like antibodies\n^^55^^ .\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nIt has been shown that the type of residue at position 375 within the\nPhe43 cavity modulates Env conformation with residues filling the Phe43\ncavity predisposing Env to more \"open\" conformations\n^^37^\\ ,\\ ^39^\\ ,\\ ^56^\\ ,\\ ^57^^ . The nature of the residue at\nposition 375 also modulates Env sensitivity to small molecule compounds\nand peptide-based inhibitors that mimic CD4 (CD4mcs)\n^^13^\\ ,\\ ^25^\\ ,\\ ^36^\\ ,\\ ^39^\\ ,\\ ^58^^ . Residues with\nlarger/bulkier side chains including histidine (His375) or tryptophan\n(Trp375) have been shown to obstruct the binding of CD4mc\n^^37^\\ ,\\ ^39^\\ ,\\ ^57^\\ ,\\ ^59^^ . Temsavir only partially overlaps\nwith CD4 and CD4mc binding sites, anchoring its phenyl group into the\nPhe43 cavity but also relying on other Env regions, mostly adjacent to\nthe β20-β21 loop. Therefore, in its mechanism of action, temsavir\ndiffers from most CD4mcs by locking Env in a \"closed\" State 1\nconformation instead of enabling Env to adopt more open conformations\n^^30^^ .\n\nIn spite of its large breadth, certain HIV-1 strains such as clade AE,\nCRF01_AE, with an invariant His375, exhibit natural resistance to\ntemsavir. His375 blocks temsavir's interaction with the Phe43 cavity,\nhowever there is more than the nature of the residue at position 375\nthat determines temsavir resistance. Our studies have shown that the\nmechanism of resistance extends beyond steric clashes within the binding\npocket. Replacement of His375 in CRF01_AE viruses with a smaller polar\nSer375, naturally present in Envs from most HIV-1 clades, does not\nrestore even partial temsavir sensitivity. The susceptibility of\nCRF01_AE Envs to temsavir can only be restored when the Ser375 change is\ncombined with the alteration of six co-evolving residues within the\ngp120 inner domain layers that appear to act synergistically to\nfacilitate temsavir binding.\n\nAt first glance, introduction of the combination of His375Ser and the\nLayer Mutations (LMHS) to CRF01_AE Env has no effect on Env's\nconformation or its assembly. A comparison of the structures of the wild\ntype and the LMHS variant of T/F100 SOSIP.644 indicates that the\naddition of the LMHS mutations causes no significant differences to the\noverall trimer conformation. These structures also confirm that the\nCRF01_AE trimer is a slightly 'more open' than Clade A BG505 (the gp120\ntrimer rotation/opening angles are about 2° larger than in BG505\nSOSIP.664). This is consistent with previous findings suggesting that\nCRF01_AE Env is prone to adopt more open conformations, a feature most\nlikely due to the larger side chain of His375 within the Phe43 cavity\n^^37^\\ ,\\ ^39^\\ ,\\ ^44^^ . However, both the wild type and the LMHS\nvariant of T/F100 SOSIP.644 have similar opening angles which suggests\neither that His375 is not the sole difference responsible for opening\nthe trimer or that the combination of His375Ser with the LM mutations\nenables Env to adopt a conformation similar to unmutated Env. Further\nstudies are required, including testing of variants with single\nHis375Ser/Thr substitutions, to fully understand the role of the residue\nat position 375 in the conformation of CFR01 AE Env. Temsavir binding\nopens T/F100 LMHS SOSIP.644 further, but it locks the Env in an\nintermediate 'closed' state (with an opening angle of 4.9° as compared\nto 18.3° for the fully CD4-triggered, 'open' trimer, PDB ID 5THR , Fig.\n3 ). Interestingly the degree of opening induced by temsavir is\nsignificantly larger for CRF01_AE than for Clade A BG505, roughly 4.9°\nas compared to 3.6°. At this point, it is important to note that there\nis a significant difference between the opening angles for the temsavir\nbound-BG505 SOSIP.664 trimers whose structures were determined by\ndifferent methods. The opening angle determined for the complex in this\npaper is 3.6° as compared to 1.5° for the trimer determined by x-ray\ncrystallography. As mentioned previously this could be due to the use of\ndifferent chaperone antibodies in structure determination or to the\ninfluence of crystal packing in the latter structure. Altogether, our\ndata indicates that although the LMHS mutations are important to enable\nthe formation of the nascent temsavir binding pocket, on their own, they\ndo not have much of an impact on the global trimer conformation.\n\nDetailed analyses of the interaction network mediated by His/Ser375 and\nLM residues reveal their cooperative roles in the formation of the\ntemsavir binding pocket and in enabling temsavir binding. In the\nunmutated CRF01_AE Env, Trp427 and the residues surrounding the pocket\nare rigidified by interactions mediated by Layers 2 and 3, the LM\nresidues blocking entry to the pocket, and the movement of the β20-β21\nloop. β20-β21 loop movement is required for pocket formation and to\nanchor temsavir within the pocket. Interestingly, the binding of\ntemsavir to Env is not possible when only His375Ser or the LM mutations\nalone are introduced to CRF01_AE Env, which strongly indicates\nintramolecular cooperativity/crosstalk between these two distal Env\nregions for temsavir pocket formation and the mechanism of CRF01_AE\nresistance to temsavir. This also confirms that there is an\nunderestimated role for the inner domain layers in shaping the\nconformation of Env, not only for the binding of CD4 and CD4mcs but also\nfor compounds like temsavir that stabilize Env in a closed state.\n\nThe temsavir binding pocket within the T/F100 LMHS SOSIP.644 resembles\nthe temsavir binding pocket in BG505 SOSIP.664 with major differences in\nhow the phenyl and the methyltriazole ring are anchored within the\npocket. Our data indicates that the methyltriazole ring may adopt\nconformations in which the methyl group can be directed either 'up'\ntowards the gp120 β13 strand or 'down' towards gp120 α1 helix. The\nLys202Thr residue change between CRF01_AE T/F100 and Clade A BG505 in\nthe area that accommodates the methyltriazole ring enables temsavir to\nbind in a conformation that potentially permits additions to the methyl\ngroup to bind to regions around the β13 strand. Such extensions could\nimprove the affinity of temsavir for CRF01_AE strains, possibly\novercoming the His375 and LM hurdle to binding. Our data also confirm\nthe propensity of temsavir to slightly adjust its conformation in order\nto compensate for the shape and chemical environment in the pocket\ninduced by minor changes in the conformation of Env. This could in part\nexplain the extraordinary breadth and potent reactivity of the compound\nin targeting HIV-1 strains of multiple clades.\n\n\n\n## Methods\n\n### Cell lines\n\nHEK293T human embryonic kidney cells and Cf2Th canine thymocytes\n(obtained from ATCC, Catalog# CRL-3216) were maintained at 37 °C under\n5% CO ~2~ in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Wisent),\nsupplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (VWR) and 100 U/mL\npenicillin/streptomycin (Wisent).

The plasmid\nencoding the transmitted/founder CRF01_AE HIV-1 ~40100~ (T/F100)\nSOSIP.664 gp140 trimer was previously described in ^^41^^ . A set of\nmodifications were introduced into the T/F100 Env sequence to generate\nthe LMHS SOSIP.664 gp140 version, including the seven LMHS mutations\n(H61Y, Q105H, V108I, N474D, I475M, and K476R) ^^38^^ , the three SOSIP\nmutations (A501C, T605C, and I599P) ^^63^^ and the replacement of its\nnatural furin cleavage site (REKR) with an enhanced cleavage site\n(RRRRRR \\[R6\\]).

The numbering of all the Env amino acid\nsequence is based on the prototypic HXB2 strain of HIV-1, where 1 is the\ninitial methionine ^^64^^ . A list of primer sequences used for\nsite-directed mutagenesis is provided in Supplementary Table ^S3^ .\n\n### Small molecule\n\nThe HIV-1 attachment inhibitor temsavir (BMS-626529) was purchased from\nAPExBIO. The compound was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a\nstock concentration of 10 mM, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until\nfurther use.\n\n### Viral neutralization assay\n\nCf2Th-CD4/CCR5 cells were infected with single-round\nluciferase-expressing HIV-1 pseudoparticles ^^56^^ . Briefly, HEK293T\ncells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with the proviral\nvector pNL4.3 (Vpr-/Env-)Luc (NIH AIDS Reagent Program) and a plasmid\nexpressing wild type or mutant HIV-1 Env at a ratio of 2:1. Two days\nafter transfection, the cell supernatants were harvested. The reverse\ntranscriptase activities of all virus preparations were measured as\ndescribed previously ^^65^^ . Each virus preparation was frozen and\nstored in aliquots at --80 °C until further use. Twenty-four hours\nbefore the infection, Cf2Th-CD4/CCR5 target cells were seeded at a\ndensity of 1 × 10 ^4^ cells/well in 96-well luminometer-compatible\ntissue culture plates (Corning). Luciferase-expressing recombinant\nviruses (10,000 reverse transcriptase units) in a final volume of 100 μL\nwere incubated with the indicated amounts of temsavir for 1 h at 37 °C\nand were then added to the target cells followed by incubation for 48 h\nat 37 °C; the medium was then removed from each well, and the cells were\nlysed by the addition of 30 μL of passive lysis buffer (Promega)\nfollowed by one freeze-thaw cycle. An LB 942 TriStar luminometer\n(Berthold Technologies) was used to measure the luciferase activity of\neach well after the addition of 100 μL of luciferin buffer (15 mM MgSO\n~4~ , 15 mM KH ~2~ PO ~4~ \\[pH 7.8\\]), 1 mM ATP, and 1 mM\ndithiothreitol) and 50 μL of 1 mM D-Luciferin free acid (Prolume). The\nneutralization half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC ~50~ )\nrepresents the amount of temsavir needed to inhibit 50% of the infection\nof Cf2Th-CD4/CCR5 cells by recombinant luciferase-expressing HIV-1\nbearing the indicated Env.\n\n### Soluble CD4 (sCD4) competition assay\n\nBinding of sCD4 to cell surface Env was performed as previously\ndescribed in ^^39^^ . Briefly, 2 × 10 ^6^ HEK293T cells were transfected\nwith 7 μg of Env expressor and 1 μg of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)\nexpressor (pIRES2-EGFP; Clontech) with the calcium phosphate method.\nWhen the pSVIII Env expressor was used, it was co-transfected with\n0.25 μg of a Tat-expressing plasmid. At 48 h post-transfection, HEK293T\ncells were detached and washed with PBS. Then, cells were incubated with\n10 μg/mL of soluble CD4 (sCD4) in presence of temsavir (10 µM) or an\nequivalent volume of the vehicle (DMSO), followed by staining performed\nwith the monoclonal anti-CD4 OKT4 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific,\nCatalog# 14-0048-82, 0.5 μg/mL) and goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies\npre-coupled to Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog#\nA21235, 2 μg/mL) to detect cell-bound sCD4. Alternatively, transfected\nHEK293T cells were stained with the anti-Env 2G12 antibody (NIH AIDS\nReagent Program, Catalog#: ARP-1476, 10 μg/mL) and goat anti-human IgG\nantibodies pre-coupled to Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific,\nCatalog# A21445, 2 μg/mL) to normalize the level of Env expression from\neach mutant. Stained cells were fixed with a PBS solution containing 2%\nformaldehyde. Live GFP+ transfected cells were identified based on a\nviability dye staining (Aqua vivid; Invitrogen). Samples were acquired\non an LSR II cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data analysis was performed\nusing FlowJo v10.5.3 (Tree Star). An example of the flow cytometry\ngating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig ^S10^ .\n\n### Protein expression and purification\n\nExpi293F GnTI ^-^ cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog# A39240) at a\ndensity of 1 × 10 ^6^ cells/mL were co-transfected with plasmids\nencoding the Twin-Strep tagged stabilized T/F100 R6. SOSIP.664 with or\nwithout LMHS mutations, and furin (DNA ratio 4:1) using polyethylenimine\n(PEI) or EndoFectin ^TM^ Max (GeneCopoeia). One-week post-transfection,\nthe 0.22 µm filtered supernatant was loaded to streptactin XT resin (IBA\nLifesciences) followed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a\nSuperdex 200 increase 10/300 column (Cytiva) equilibrated with 1x\nphosphate buffered saline (PBS). The SOSIP.664 trimer peak was harvested\nas described ^^63^^ and protein purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE.\n\nThe expression plasmids encoding the heavy and light chains of 8ANC195\n(expression plasmids kindly provided by Michel Nussenzweig, the\nRockefeller University) were transiently transfected into Expi293F cells\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog# A14528) using ExpiFectamine 293\ntransfection as described (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 6-days\npost-transfection, antibody was purified on Protein A resin from\nclarified cell supernatant (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Large-scale\nproduction of 10--1074 was conducted at Scripps Research Center for\nAntibody Development & Production (La Jolla, CA) using plasmid DNA for\ntransient transfections of IgG1 10--1074 in 293F cells. Expressed\nantibody in cell culture supernatant was purified over protein\nG-Sepharose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 72), eluted with\n0.1 M acetic acid (pH 2.8), and dialyzed back into PBS (pH 7.2). The\npurity of the preparations was checked by size exclusion chromatography\non a Superdex 200 10/300 column and determined to be \\>99% pure. Fabs\nwere generated from an overnight papain digestion of IgG at 37 °C using\nimmobilized papain agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The resulting Fab\nwas separated from Fc and undigested IgG by passage over protein A\nresin. Fab was further purified by gel filtration using a Superose 6\n10/300 column (Cytiva) before use in cryo-EM sample preparation.\n\n### Negative staining and cryo-EM sample preparation, and data collection\n\nT/F100 SOSIP.664 (GnT1 ^-^ produced) and its LMHS mutant were incubated\nwith 20-fold molar excess of 8ANC195 and 10--1074 Fabs in the\npresence/absence of 0.5--1 mM temsavir overnight at 4 °C before the\npurification on a Superose 6 300/10 GL column (Cytiva). The complex peak\nwas harvested, concentrated to 0.8--1.2 mg/mL in 1x PBS buffer. For\nnegative staining, complex at concentration of 5 ug/ml was dispersed on\nthe grid (Formvar/Carbon Square Mesh - Cu, 400 Mesh, UA, FCF400-CU-50)\nwith contrasting agent (2% uranium) and images were taken on the\nransmission Electron Microscopes (TEM), Joel1011.\n\nFor cryo-EM data collection, 3 μL of protein was deposited on holey\ncarbon copper grids (QUANTIFOIL R 1.2/1.3-2 nm, 300 mesh, EMS) which had\nbeen glow-discharged for 20 s at 15 mA using PELCO easiGlow (TedPella\nInc). All grids were vitrified in liquid ethane using Vitrobot Mark IV\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a blot time of 2.5--4 s at 4 °C and 95%\nhumidity. The frozen grids were screened on a FEI Talos Arctica\nmicroscope at 200 kV equipped with a FEI Falcon3EC detector using the\nEPU software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cryo-EM data of LMHS/temsavir\nwere acquired on a FEI Glacios electron microscope operating at 200 kV,\nequipped with a Gatan K3 direct electron detector.

The gp120 sequence analysis comprising the complete V3 loop sequence was performed from plasma sampled at the date of screening of the MVC EAP.\"\nRationale: The paper mentions sequencing of the protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes, as well as the gp120 sequence, which is part of the envelope gene.\nAnswer: PR, RT, Env\n\nPMID: 27084918\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: The E157Q virus was hypersusceptible to dolutegravir, displaying an IC ~50~ of 0.43 nM, which was 100-fold lower than WT (52.1 nM). The combination of E157Q and R263K increased dolutegravir resistance by 20- and 10-fold compared with the WT and R263K enzymes, respectively. We also investigated the effects of E157Q on IN DNA binding activity and susceptibility to a DNA binding inhibitor in tissue culture, in part because we recently identified Glu157 as a putative interaction domain with the HIV IN DNA binding inhibitor FZ41\nRationale: The paper includes data on the susceptibility of various HIV-1 mutants to different integrase inhibitors, including dolutegravir and raltegravir, indicating that in vitro drug susceptibility data was reported.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 38206187\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"We measured the phenotypic susceptibility to doravirine in site-directed mutants containing V106I, V106A, V106M, or Y188L mutations in a subtype B (NL4-3) and CRF02_AG genetic background, and in a subset of recombinant viruses with clinically derived RT-RNAse H coding region harboring V106I and no other major NNRTI RAMs. The methodology has been previously described by Malet et al [11]. Briefly, RT mutants of HIV-1 were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quikchange II XL mutagenesis kit (Agilent) using specific primers introducing the expected mutations into plasmids pNL4-3, pHXB2, and pCRF02_AG. After mutagenesis, all constructs were sequenced to verify the presence of the mutations and the plasmids were prepared using the NucleoBond midi preparation kit (Macherey Nagel). Viral stocks were obtained by transfecting 293-T cells with the mutagenized HIV-1 molecular clones or the linearized pNL4-3ΔRT-RNAseH vector together with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicon including the corresponding RT-RNAseH coding region from each clinical sample, as previously described [12]. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the viral supernatants were recovered, quantified through the evaluation of the expression of β-galactosidase in TZM-bl cells, and frozen at −80°C.\n\nIn vitro susceptibility to doravirine was determined through a TZM-bl cell-based assay previously shown to correlate well with the reference phenotypic Phenosense Assay [13]. Briefly, 10 000 TZM-bl cells/well were infected with the wild-type NL4-3 strain or NNRTI-resistant viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05 in the presence of 5-fold dilutions of doravirine (MedChemExpress) ranging from 1 μM to 0.512 pM. After 48 hours, cells were treated with Glo-Lysis buffer (Promega) and the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay (Promega), then relative luminescence units were measured through the GloMax Discover instrument (Promega) and elaborated with GraphPad software to calculate 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) values. Fold-change (FC) values were calculated with respect to the IC50 value obtained with the NL4-3 wild-type strain.  Background\nLimited data are available regarding the susceptibility of the reverse transcriptase V106I polymorphism to doravirine.\n\n Methods\nDoravirine susceptibility was measured in site-directed mutants (SDMs) containing V106A, V106M, and Y188L mutations in subtype B (NL4-3, HXB2) and CRF02_AG background and in new recombinant viruses with RT harboring V106I from clinical isolates.\n\n Results\nThe V106I subtype B was detected in 1523 of 26 428 sequences, showing a 3.2% in B and 2.6% in non-B subtypes, and was higher in subtype F (8.1%) and D (14.3%). Fold-changes (FC) in susceptibility for SDMs were below doravirine biological cutoff (3.0) for V106I, but not for V106A, V106M, and Y188L. Clinically derived viruses tested included 22 B (median FC, 1.2; interquartile range [IQR], 0.9–1.6) and 28 non-B subtypes (median FC, 1.8; IQR, 0.9–3.0). Nine (18%) viruses showed FC values equal or higher than the doravirine biological FC cutoff.\"\nRationale: The paper  describes the methodology used to measure the phenotypic susceptibility of various HIV-1 mutants to doravirine. This includes creating site-directed mutants with specific mutations (V106I, V106A, V106M, Y188L) in different genetic backgrounds (subtype B NL4-3 and CRF02_AG), as well as using recombinant viruses from clinical samples.

Sequencing of protease and\nreverse transcriptase regions was performed for participants\nexperiencing virological failure, VF, (Plasma viral load, PVL ≥ 1000 RNA\ncopies/ml). HIV-1 subtypes were inferred by phylogeny;\nimmuno-virological responses were monitored at 3-time points (T1-T3).\nCox regression modeling was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios\n(aHRs) of progression to: CD4 \\< 250, and PVL \\> 5log ~10~ , adjusted\nfor acquired drug resistance, gender, ART line, adherence, and duration\non treatment; p \\< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n### Results\n\nOf the 141 participants in VF enrolled, the male-female ratio was 1:1;\nmean age was 15 (±3) years; and median \\[IQR\\] duration on ART was 51\n\\[46--60\\] months. In all phases, 17 viral clades were found with a\npredominant CRF02_AG (58.2%, 59.4%, and 58.3%). From T1-T3 respectively,\nthere was an increasing CD4 count (213 \\[154--313\\], 366 \\[309--469\\],\nand 438 \\[364--569\\] cells/mm ^3^ ) and decline log ~10~ PVL (5.23,\n4.43, and 4.43), similar across subtypes. Among participants with\nCRF02_AG infection, duration of treatment was significantly associated\nwith both rates of progression to CD4 \\< 250, and PVL \\> 5log ~10~ , aHR\n= 0.02 (0.001--0.52), and aHR = 0.05 (0.01--0.47) respectively.\nMoreover, four potential new HIV-1 recombinants were identified\n(CRF02_AG/02D, CRF02_AG/02A1F2, D/CRF02_AG, and AF2/CRF02_AG),\nindicating a wide viral diversity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAmong APHI in settings like Cameroon, there is a wide genetic diversity\nof HIV-1, driven by CRF02_AG and with potential novel clades due to\nongoing recombination events. Duration of treatment significantly\nreduces the risk of disease progression.\n\n## 2. Materials and methods\n\n### 2.1 Study design\n\nA cohort study was conducted from 2018--2020 among 311 adolescents\nliving with perinatally acquired HIV (APHI) receiving antiretroviral\ntherapy (ART) in one of the selected health facilities within the\n*\"Resistance Evolution among Adolescents in Yaoundé and its\nsurroundings\" (READY-study)* in the Centre region of Cameroon.\nParticipants were recruited following consecutive, and exhaustive\nsampling. Follow-up was performed at enrollment (T1), at 6 months (T2),\nand at 12 months (T3). Included in the current analysis were only\nparticipants failing first- and second-line ART with plasma viral load\n(PVL) ≥ 1000 RNA copies/ml ( Table 1 ).\n\n\n### 2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria\n\nIncluded in the study were APHI; aged 10--19 years, receiving a standard\nreverse transcriptase inhibitor-based first- or ritonavir-boosted\nprotease inhibitor-based second-line ART regimen for at least 6 months,\nprovided written assent, and informed consent from their legal\nguardian(s), and irrespective of exposure to the prevention of mother to\nchild transmission (PMTCT) antiretrovirals. APHI who were not formally\nregistered in the ART monitoring system of any study site, reported to\nbe ART-naïve, or on a drug regimen not included in the national\nguidelines, or structured treatment interruption were not enrolled.\nMoreover, participants who freely withdrew from the study, or were\ntransferred out of a study site before mid- or endpoint were excluded.\n\n### 2.3 Sample size\n\nThe minimal sample size was established following statistical\ncalculations \\[ 12 \\]. Assuming the rate of VF at 40%, a 95% confidence\ninterval, and 80% statistical power, the sample size was 174\nparticipants. Adding 10% potential loss to follow-up (LTFU) during the\none-year study period and 20% sequencing failure rate, the minimal\nsample size was 243 APHI, majoring to 250 total sample size, further\nstratified into 150 APHI in the referral centers (75 per site), and 100\nin the rural HIV management unit settings (50 per site), as per coverage\nin ART in these two geographical locations. Effectively 311 participants\nwere enrolled, 213 from referral centers and 98 from management units.\nOf these, the current analysis included 141 participants (with PVL ≥\n1000 RNA copies/mL) who had sequence data available from enrolment to\n12-month follow-up.\n\n### 2.4 Laboratory procedure\n\nFollowing enrolment, ten mL of whole blood were collected from each\nparticipant and transported on icepacks within 6 hours to the virology\nlaboratory of the Chantal Biya international reference center (CIRCB),\nYaoundé, Cameroon. From these, a whole blood aliquot (for CD4\nenumeration) was gotten. Moreover, plasma aliquots (for PVL and HIV\ngenotypic resistance testing, GRT) were obtained after centrifugation at\n1600 rpm for 10 minutes and stored at −80°C for further analyses. CD4\ncell count was performed using the Pima CD4 (Abbott/Pantech (Pty) Ltd,\nWestville, South Africa) automatic test as per the manufacturer's\ninstructions. PVL measurement was performed using the Abbott Applied\nBiosystem platform (Real-Time PCR AB m2000RT) as per the manufacturer's\ninstructions (Abbott Laboratories, USA), with a detection threshold of\n40 copies/mL (lower) and 10,000,000 copies/mL (upper). To increase the\nsensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, HIV-1\nRNA extraction was performed from 1000 μL of plasma aliquots and an\ninitial 2-hour refrigerated centrifugation step at 14 000 rpm to\nconcentrate viral RNA was also performed. HIV-1 RNA was extracted\nmanually from 140 μL of plasma using the QIAGEN protocol (QIAamp ^®^ DNA\nMinikit; QIAGEN, Courtaboeuf, France). GRT was done when the viral load\nwas \\> 1000 copies/mL using an in-house protocol \\[ 13 \\]. Eight\nin-house primers (B, F, SEQ1, SEQ2, SEQ3, SEQ4, SEQ5, TAK3) that\ncompletely covered the protease and reverse-transcriptase regions in the\npol gene fragment (\\~1600 base pairs) were used for sequencing. The\nlatter were designed such that each zone of the fragment was covered by\nat least two primers.

Reference sequences included in the\nphylogenetic analysis were downloaded following a blast search from the\nNational Center for Biotechnology Information website;\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ .\n\nThe major outcomes from the study were the viral genetic diversity among\nAPHI, immune-virological responses stratified by subtype, the trends of\nvirological response stratified by subtype, and the potential emerging\nresistant variants among these APHI failing treatment. Adequate\nimmunological status was defined as absolute CD4 count ≥ 250 cells/mm\n^3^ and Immunological failure (IF) as \\< 250 CD4 cells/mm ^3^ \\[ 17 \\].\nPVL was classified as high viral load (PVL \\> 5log ~10~ RNA copies/ml),\nand low viral load (PVL \\< 5 log ~10~ ) \\[ 18 \\].

A comparison of means and medians of various\ncharacteristics was done using the paired t-test. Chi-square and\nFisher's exact tests were used for determining associations between\nqualitative variables. Study endpoints were defined as CD4 count \\< 250\ncells/mm ^3^ and PVL \\> 5 log RNA/mL. Cox proportional hazard regression\nmodels were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of disease progression\nto each endpoint stratified by HIV-1 subtype, adjusting for the presence\nof drug resistance mutations, gender, ART line, adherence, and duration\non ART. Kaplan Meier curves were used to examine time to CD4 count\ndecline to \\< 250 cells/mm ^3^ and VL \\> 5 log ~10~ RNA copies/mL on ART\nacross subtypes, with the use of the log-rank test to test the\nsignificance of observed differences between groups. Survival curves\nwere drawn using SPSS version 22. Moreover, median CD4 cell rise and PVL\ndecline over time were determined and presented as figures.\n\n### 2.6 Ethical statement\n\nAdministrative authorizations were obtained from the Directors of the\nhealth facilities used in this study. Moreover, an ethical clearance was\nobtained from the Cameroonian National ethics committee for research on\nhuman subjects (clearance № 2018/01/981/CE/CNERSH/SP) in Yaoundé,\nCameroon. Written informed consent and assent were obtained from the\nparents or legal guardian(s), and every participant respectively.\nLaboratory results of viremia, CD4 cell count, and GRT were freely\ndelivered to each participant for their clinical benefits, data\nmanagement was under strict confidentiality by using unique identifiers,\nand access to data was password protected.\n\n\n\n## 3. Results\n\nThe EDCTP-Ready study parent cohort consisted of three hundred and\neleven consenting adolescents living with perinatally acquired HIV on\nfirst- and second-line ART at enrolment ( Table 1 ). Of these, 141\nparticipants with PVL ≥ 1000 RNA copies/mL, and whose samples were\nsuccessfully sequenced were included in the current assessment. From\nT1-T3 respectively, the proportions of sequences successfully obtained\nwere 45.5% (55/121), 91.4% (96/105), and 88.2% (60/68) ( Table 1 ).\nOverall, the majority (59.6%) of the study participants were female,\nwith a mean (± standard deviation) age of 15(± 3). The mean age at HIV\ndiagnosis was 6 (± 5) years, and the median \\[IQR\\] duration on ART was\n51 \\[46--60\\] months. At T1, T2, and T3 respectively, adherence-level\nwas 67.3%, 51.0%, and 50.0%; and the majority (89.1%, 77.1%, 66.7) of\nthe participants were on first-line treatment ( Table 2 ). Most of the\nparticipants (34.5%, 31.3%, and 31.7%) were on a TDF + 3TC + EFV-based\nregimen ( Table 2 ). There was an increased rate of switch to\nsecond-line protease inhibitor-based ART (10.9%, 22.9%, and 33.3%, p =\n0.0007) favored by the presence of acquired drug resistance mutations to\nprevious treatment ( Table 2 ). From T1-T3 respectively, there were\ndeclining rates of immunological failure (IF) (49.1%, 32.3%, and 18.3, p\n\\< 0.0001), and acquired drug resistance (96.4%, 91.7%, and 85.0%, p =\n0.099) ( Table 2 ) ( Fig 1a ). Acquired drug resistance was driven by\nthe drug classes of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors\n(96.4%, 88.5%, and 85.0%) ( Fig 1b ). Likewise, there was a decrease in\nthe proportion of participants with high viremia (52.7%, 28.1%, and\n31.7%, p \\< 0.0001) ( Table 2 ). Seventeen viral clades were identified\nin this study, with a predominance of the CRF02_AG variant (66.0%) ( Fig\n2a ).\n\nFig 1\n\n**a:** Trends of HIVDR across time points.

Error bars denote standard error.\n\nA rich diversity of HIV-1 viral clades was observed, with a mixture of\nboth pure subtypes (A, C, D, F2, G, and H), and recombinant variants\n(A/G, A/J, CRF A1/G, G/J, CRF G/A, CRF02_AG, CRF11_cpx, CRF13_cpx,\nCRF18_cpx, CRF37_cpx, and CRF49_cpx) ( Fig 2a ). For data analysis,\nthese viral clades were grouped into two distinct classes, CRF02_AG and\nnon_CRF02_AG (consisting of subtypes A, C, D, F2, G, H; and variants\nA/G, A/J, CRF A1/G, G/J, CRF G/A, CRF11_cpx, CRF13_cpx, CRF18_cpx,\nCRF37_cpx, and CRF49_cpx).\n\nAt enrolment, there was no statistically significant difference between\nthe median CD4 count, log ~10~ PVL, and ART line across subtypes (p \\>\n0.05). The majority (75.9%) of the participants were on reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitor (RTI) -based first-line regimens (Tables ​\n(Tables1 1 and ​ and2), 2 ), and the distribution of median log ~10~ PVL\nwas similar across subtypes over time (p \\> 0.05). The median \\[IQR\\]\nCD4 count at enrolment was higher among participants harboring\nnon-CRF02_AG viral clades (328 \\[112--759\\] cells/mm ^3^ ), as compared\nto those with the CRF02_AG variant (207 \\[33--313\\]). A similarly\nvariable distribution in median log ~10~ PVL across subtypes was\nobserved with a lower value among participants harboring non-CRF02_AG\nclades (5.22 \\[4.57--5.72\\]), relative to those with the CRF02_AG\nvariant (5.25 \\[4.52--5.49\\]). However, this variability across subtypes\nwas not statistically significant, p\\>0.05 ( Table 3 ).\n\nAt 6-months post-enrolment, improving values in median CD4 count were\nobserved with a higher value among non-CRF02_AG clades (426\n\\[195--717\\]), in comparison to the CRF02_AG variant (345 \\[186--600\\]).\nThese were accompanied by a declining trend in median log ~10~ PVL, with\na lower value observed in participants infected with the CRF02_AG\nvariant (4.37 \\[3.86--5.13\\]), relative to those with non-CRF02_AG\nclades (4.48 \\[3.77--5.06\\]). Likewise, this difference was not\nstatistically significant with respect to genetic variability ( Table 3\n). The proportion of participants who had an adequate immunological\nresponse, as well as those with PVL \\< 5 log was comparable across\nsubtypes with p-value \\> 0.05 (Tables ​ (Tables4 4 and ​ and5 5 ).\n\nAt 12-month follow-up, there was a further increase in median CD4 count\nwith a better outcome observed among non-CRF02_AG-infected participants\n(536 \\[364--701\\]), as opposed to those with the CRF02_AG variant (398\n\\[286--683\\]). Similarly, there was a declining trend in median log ~10~\nPVL, with a lower value observed in non-CRF02_AG clades (4.28\n\\[3.62--5.23\\]), as compared to that in the CRF02_AG variant (4.44\n\\[3.81--5.21\\]). This difference was not statistically significant with\nrespect to HIV-1 subtypes/genetic variants ( Table 3 ).\n\nConcerning median CD4 count, all subtypes showed a consecutive rise over\ntime ( Fig 2b ). Likewise, a steady decrease in median PVL was observed\nfrom enrolment to the end of the observation period ( Fig 2c ). At the\nend of the study, no statistically significant differences with respect\nto subtype were observed in both participants who experienced adequate\nimmunological response (CD4 count ≥ 250 cells/mm ^3^ ), and those with\nPVL\\< 5 log ~10~ (Tables ​ (Tables4 4 and ​ and5 5 ).\n\nBy the end of the assessment period, 22.2% (28/126) of the participants\nexperienced immunological failure (CD4 \\< 250 cells/mm ^3^ ), and 34.3%\n(47/137) had PVL \\> 5 log ~10~ RNA copies/mL (Tables ​ (Tables4 4 and ​\nand5). 5 ). Concerning progression to study endpoints, 18.3% vs. 4.1% of\nparticipants infected with the CRF02_AG variant and non-CRF02_AG clades\nrespectively had CD4 cell count \\< 250 cells/mm ^3^ at the end of\nfollow-up. Likewise, proportions of 22.6% and 11.7% of participants\nharboring CRF02_AG and non-CRF02_AG infections respectively had PVL \\> 5\nlog ~10~ RNA copies/mL ( Table 6 ).\n\nThe overall median time to poorer immunologic outcome (CD4 \\<\n250cells/mm ^3^ ) was 61.00 (95% confidence interval, CI: 55.83--66.17)\nmonths. Participants infected with the CRF02_AG variant (57.00: 95% CI:\n51.67--62.33 months) had a shorter median time to a poor immunologic\noutcome as compared to those infected by non-CRF02_AG clades (62.00: 95%\nCI: 38.88--85.12 months). However, these differences in the survival\ncurves of the different subtypes/variants were not statistically\nsignificant, p = 0.538 ( Fig 3a ).\n\nFig 3\n\n**a:** Kaplan Meier analysis of time estimate to reach CD4 count \\< 250\ncells/mm ^3^ . **b:** Probability of plasma viral load \\> 5 log RNA\ncopies/mL over time. **c:** Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the\nProtease-Reverse transcriptase gene regions of study participant\nsequences.

Those with CRF02_AG infection had a\nshorter median time to this endpoint (60.00: 95% CI: 52.72--67.28\nmonths) as compared to participants infected by non-CRF02_AG clades\n(91.00: 95% CI: 75.38--106.62 months). The observed differences in\nsurvival curves across subtypes were not statistically significant, with\np = 0.251 ( Fig 3b ).\n\nOver the entire study period, the duration of ART was significantly\nassociated with a decrease in the probability of experiencing poorer\nimmunologic outcomes among participants infected by the CRF02_AG variant\nat any given time over the two-year duration of the study \\[adjusted\nhazard ratio (aHR) = 0.02, 95% confidence interval (95% CI):\n0.001--0.52, and p = 0.017\\]. Similarly, there was a statistically\nsignificant association between the duration of treatment and the\nprobability of a decline in PVL in participants with CRF02_AG infection\n\\[aHR = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.01--0.47, and p = 0.008\\] ( Table 7 ).\n\nAssessing potentially emerging HIV-1 genetic variants, or unique\nrecombinant forms (URF) associated with reduced viral susceptibility to\ncurrently available ARV drugs in the Cameroonian context, using four\nrapid subtyping tools revealed a high rate of inter-subtype\nrecombination, confirmed by phylogenetic analyses ( Fig 3c ), with the\nidentification of eight discordant potential unassigned URFs. From\nthese, further analyses to detect and analyze recombination and/or\ngenomic assortment signals using RDP4 revealed four potential URFs with\ndistinct breakpoints, each associated with major drug resistance\nmutations mainly driven by the ARV drug classes of non-nucleoside\nreverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and nucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) ( Table 8 ). Further phylogenetic\nanalysis suggest the presence of inter-subtype recombinants; recombinant\nCRF02_AG/02D, recombinant CRF02_AG/02A1F2, recombinant D/CRF02_AG, and\nrecombinant AF2/CRF02_AG ( Fig 3d ).\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nOur study was conducted among adolescents living with perinatally\nacquired HIV (APHI) in urban and rural settings of the Center region of\nCameroon. The predominant genetic variant was CRF02_AG, this is similar\nto other studies carried out in Cameroon \\[ 4 , 6 , 9 , 19 -- 21 \\]. The\nCRF02_AG variant is the most prevalent HIV-1 viral clade in West Africa\n\\[ 1 \\]. It is a recombinant of pure subtypes A and G, which are both\nassociated with slower disease progression to AIDS \\[ 5 \\]. The higher\ninfectivity observed in infection with this variant may be attributed to\nits enhanced replicative fitness over its pure subtype constituents and\nhence improved adaptation to its host. HIV-1 subtypes C, D, and the\ngenetic variant CRF01_AE observed in our study have been associated with\nfaster HIV-1 disease progression to AIDS \\[ 7 , 10 , 22 , 23 \\] and\nadvanced immunodeficiency. Evidence suggests that recombinant forms have\na faster rate of disease progression when compared to pure lineages.\nThis is because they have better replicative fitness as compared to\ntheir parental forms \\[ 5 \\]. However, the immune-virological response\nin this evaluation was similar across viral clades, despite the presence\nof a wide array of circulating recombinant forms and unique recombinant\nforms (CRF18_cpx, CRF49_cpx, G/J, CRF A1/G, CRF G/A, CRF11_cpx,\nCRF13_cpx, CRF37_cpx).\n\nIn this study, there was no statistically significant difference across\nsubtypes with respect to CD4 cell count at enrolment. Likewise, there\nwas no significant difference in the proportion of participants who\nachieved adequate immunological response at 12 months post-enrolment.\nThese results were similar to those obtained in other studies \\[ 24 , 25\n\\]. Moreover, assessing endpoint events in our study revealed that\nduration on ART was significantly associated with the rate of\nprogression to poorer immunological outcomes among participants with\nCRF02_AG infection. It should be noted that the focus of the majority of\nstudies of inference on the effect of subtype on immunologic decline has\nbeen focused on patients' pre-exposure to ART at baseline. Additionally,\nmost focus on comparing patients harboring subtype B versus non-B\nsubtypes, hence grouping minority variants into non-B subtypes. This\nmakes it difficult to assess the effect of these less predominant viral\nclades. Studies carried out in China, where variant CRF01_AE is the most\npredominant clade, revealed that this variant is associated with fast\nprogression to AIDS (with a shorter median time from the estimated date\nof seroconversion to AIDS) and advanced immunodeficiency (shorter median\ntime from estimated date of seroconversion to CD4 cell count \\<100\ncells/μl) as compared to non-CRF01_AE viral clades \\[ 22 , 23 \\].\nHowever, a study in Nigeria reported similar rates of CD4 cell count\nrecovery across all subtypes \\[ 24 \\], which is concordant with the\nresults obtained in our evaluation. In contrast, a previous study\nrevealed that patients infected with either a CRF02_AG strain or another\nnon-B viral clade had better immunological responses than those infected\nwith a subtype-B virus \\[ 26 \\]. Despite the absence of statistical\nsignificance in the rate of progression to poorer immunologic outcome in\nthis evaluation, HIV-1 genotypes such as subtypes C and D, and variant\nCRF01_AE were identified in our study population. These have previously\nbeen associated with faster disease progression \\[ 22 , 23 , 27 \\],\nlikely due to faster rates of CD4 T-cell decline. Additionally, a higher\nprobability of having a virus with a CXCR4 tropism in subtype D\ninfections has been reported. Conversely, subtypes A and G have been\nassociated with a less aggressive disease progression \\[ 7 \\]. Further\nanalysis into the rise in median CD4 cell count over time, as well as\nthe estimated time to achieve favorable immunologic response in our\nstudy, showed similar responses across all subtypes. These results agree\nwith those of a previous study carried out in a West African country \\[\n24 \\]. However, they are discordant with results obtained in\ngeographical regions outside West-Central Africa \\[ 26 -- 29 \\].\n\nVirological responses at enrolment, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups on\ntreatment were comparable across all subtypes. These were similar to\nresults obtained by Ogbenna *et al* \\[ 24 \\] but in disagreement with\nthose obtained by Chaix *et al* in France where infection with CRF02_AG\nand other non-B viral clades conferred better virological responses than\npatients harboring B-subtypes \\[ 26 \\]. These findings of similar\nvirological responses across subtypes are consistent with those observed\nin previous studies that compared the responses to ART stratified by\nHIV-1 subtype \\[ 24 , 26 , 28 , 30 \\]. Our study also showed a\ncontinuous decrease in median PVL over time, as well as comparable\noverall virologic responses across subtypes. Similar observations have\nbeen reported in other studies \\[ 24 , 26 , 28 , 29 \\].\n\nIn our study, we identified four sequences with discordant subtypes\naccording to the rapid subtyping tools used, which we classified as\npotential URFs. In addition, each of these sequences was associated with\nat least one major drug-resistant mutation. These results are in\nagreement with those observed in several other studies carried out in\nCameroon \\[ 4 , 9 , 19 , 31 , 32 \\]. This study provided insight into\nthe evolving HIV-1 diversity, the genomic complexity of URF infections,\nthe structural dynamics of emerging recombinant forms, and possible\nimplications for antiretroviral treatment. Thus, underlining the\nnecessity of performing full/near-full length next-generation sequencing\nto achieve accurate HIV surveillance, subtyping, and genotypic analyses.\n\nAs generally observed in longitudinal studies, there were some missing\nlaboratory data over time, as well as loss to follow-up of participants\nby the end of the study which made it difficult to follow-up the entire\nsample population. These may have had an impact on data quality and the\noverall impact of the study findings on the target population.\nFurthermore, limiting sequencing only to samples that had PVL ≥ 1000 RNA\ncopies/ml and sequencing failure of some samples led to an\nunderestimation of HIV genotypes. Additionally, further analyses like\nSimplot++ ought to be performed to investigate sequence similarity and\nconfirm the detection of recombination events. However, the multi-time\npoint follow-up period, the personalized monitoring, and repeated\ngenotyping of participants to ensure within-program comparison of\nsubtypes in a bid to limit expected confounders are the strengths of\nthis study.\n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nThis study revealed a wide variety of HIV-1 genotypes with CRF02_AG\npredominance. Among participants with CRF02_AG infection, duration on\nantiretroviral treatment was significantly associated to both rates of\nprogression to poorer immunological outcomes, and higher PVL following\ntreatment failure. Virological outcomes were similar across HIV-1\nsubtypes/variants. Therefore, provided adequate observance of treatment,\nand personalized follow-up of this underserved adolescent population\nwith particular importance given to immunological follow-up, current ART\nregimens have similar efficacy irrespective of subtype.\n\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nJF, TMA grant number:1027, awarded by the European and Developing\nCountries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP), under the Career\nDevelopment Fellowship.

Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences.

Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon.\nRationale: The paper doest not mention in vitro drug susceptibility data or phenotypic data.

Annual proportions of recent infections (RI) among newly diagnosed persons infected with HIV-1 in Slovenia during 27 years (1986--2012) were determined using an algorithm consisting of routine baseline CD4 and HIV viral load measurements and the Aware BED EIA HIV-1 Incidence Test (BED test). The study included the highest coverage of persons diagnosed with HIV during the entire duration of an HIV epidemic in a given country/region (71%). Out of 416 patients, 170 (40.9%) had a baseline CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/mm ^3^ and/or HIV-1 viral load less than 400 copies/ml and were characterized as having a long-standing infection (LSI). The remaining 246 patients were additionally tested using the BED test. Overall, 23% (97/416) of the patients were labeled RI. The characteristics significantly associated with RI were as follows: younger age, acute retroviral syndrome, CDC class A and other than C, no AIDS defining illnesses, HIV test performed in the past, a higher viral load, and a higher CD4 cell count. An interesting trend in the proportion of RI was observed, with a peak in 2005 (47% of RI) and the lowest point in 2008 (12%) in parallel with a rise in the numbers of new HIV diagnoses. This study could help promote the idea of introducing periodic HIV incidence monitoring using a simple and affordable algorithm. J. Med.

Although the country has made a promising progress in\nantiretroviral therapy, recent studies have indicated that pretreatment\ndrug resistance (PDR) is alarmingly increasing, which has become a\nchallenge for the effectiveness of HIV treatment. Epidemiologic data on\nPDR is necessary to help establish ART regimens with good efficacy.\nThus, this systematic review aimed to determine the trend analysis of\nPDR among ART-naïve individuals along with HIV variant dynamics in\nEthiopia.\n\n### Method\n\nHIV-1 pol sequences from studies conducted between 2003 and 2018 among\nART-naïve Ethiopian individuals were retrieved from GenBank and analyzed\nfor the presence of PDR mutations (PDRM) along with the analysis of\nHIV-1 variant dynamics. The Calibrated Population Resistance (CPR) tool\nVersion 8.1 and the REGA HIV-1 Subtyping Tool Version 3 were used to\ndetermine the PDRM and HIV-1 genetic diversity, respectively.\n\n### Result\n\nWe identified nine studies and analyzed 1070 retrieved HIV-1 pol\nsequences in this systematic review. The pooled prevalence of PDR was\n4.8% (51/1070), including 1.4% (15/1070), 2.8% (30/1070), and 0.8%\n(9/1070) for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), non-NRTI\n(NNRTI), and protease inhibitor (PI) resistance, respectively. NRTI and\nNNRTI concurrent PDRM were observed among 0.2% (2/799) of the analyzed\nsequences. The overall PDR prevalence has been increasing over the\nyears. Though the prevalence of the NNRTI, NRTI, and PI PDR also\nincreased over the years, the NNRTI increment was more pronounced than\nthe others, reaching 7.84% in 2018 from 2.19% in 2003. The majority\n(97%; 1038/1070) of the genetic diversity was HIV-1 subtype C virus,\nfollowed by subtype C' (2%; 20/1038) and other subtypes (1%; 10/1038).\n\n### Conclusions\n\nAccording to this systematic review, the overall pooled prevalence of\nPDR is low. Despite the low prevalence, there has been an increasing\ntrend of PDR over the years, which implies the need for routine\nsurveillance of PDRMs along with preventive measures. Hence, this\nsupports the recently endorsed transition of ART regimens from NNRTI to\nintegrase strand transfer inhibitor-based regimens recommended by the\nWHO. In addition, this finding underscores the need for routine baseline\ngenotypic drug resistance testing for all newly diagnosed HIV-infected\npatients before initiating treatment to halt the upward trend of PDR.\n\n\n## Methods\n\n### Sequence data source, selection criteria, and search strategy\n\nThe online databases Google Scholar and PubMed were searched for PDR in\nEthiopia to identify relevant literature published until March 30, 2023.\nThe search for the literature was done using the following search terms:\n\\[(\"human immunodeficiency virus\" OR HIV OR AIDS OR \"acquired\nimmunodeficiency syndrome\") AND (\"antiretroviral therapy\" OR HAART OR\nART) AND (\"drug resistance\" OR naïve OR \\\"pregnant women\\\" OR antenatal\nOR subtype OR surveillance) AND (Ethiopia)\\]. In addition, the\nInternational AIDS Society (IAS) Conference, and Conference on\nRetroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) databases were also\nsearched for additional articles. Upon duplicate removal, all retrieved\npublications were reviewed to determine which studies contained data\nregarding PDR in Ethiopia. All PDR studies that involved ART-naïve\nHIV-infected individuals aged ≥ 14 years old in Ethiopia were included\nin this review. We excluded studies conducted in children, those that\nhave incomplete sequences (did not contain complete PR (99 codons) and\npartial RT (the first 230 codons), and those studies that were done\namong ART-experienced individuals (Fig. 1 ).\n\nFig. 1\n\nFlow diagram of studies identified and selected for the pooled sequence\nanalysis\n\n### Sequence analysis\n\nSequences of the included studies were downloaded from GenBank if they\nwere publicly available and, if they were not found online, study\nauthors were contacted for the respective sequences. Where several\nsequences were found from the same research participant (for instance,\nin cohort studies), we only included the sequence from the earliest time\npoint. Accordingly, we included 1070 sequences (from the total of 1226\nretrieved sequences) that have full protease and partial RT. Before\nsequence analysis, quality control of the pooled sequences from these\nstudies was done using the Calibrated Population Resistance (CPR) tool\nversion 8.1, available in the Stanford HIVDB database (\nhttp://cpr.stanford.edu/cpr.cgi , (accessed on 02 April 2023)).\nSequences (156 out of the total 1226 retrieved sequences) with poor\nquality based on the CPR quality tool were excluded from the analysis.\n\n### Genotypic drug resistance, phylogenetic and statistical analysis\n\nGenotypic PDR mutations (PDRMs) were determined using CPR tool version\n8.1. (accessed on 05 April 2023) and were characterized according to the\nsampling year of the retrieved sequence data. We did not include sex and\nage information in the datasets or perform correlations between PDRMs\nand sociodemographic factors because most sequence annotations retrieved\ndid not include this information. The HIV-1 subtype determination was\ndone using the REGA HIV subtyping tool version 3.46 (Leuven University,\nLeuven, Belgium; https://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/hiv ,\naccessed on 04 April 2023). The sequence alignment and maximum\nlikelihood phylogenetic tree construction was made using the Geneious\nPrime® 2023.0.4 Software ( https://www.geneious.com ) and was\nconsecutively visualized by Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) version 6 (\nhttps://itol.embl.de/ ). PDR level classification (low: \\< 5%, moderate:\n5--15%, or high: \\> 15%) was made based on the WHO threshold survey\nprotocol \\[ 11 \\].\n\n\n\n## Results\n\nWe first identified 823 research articles and excluded 788 of the\nstudies based on title and abstract review. The rest 25 full-text\narticles were further reviewed based on the eligibility criteria, which\nled to the selection of 12 articles for analysis, three of which were\nremoved due to the unavailability of sequence data (Fig. 1 ).\n\n### Prevalence and drug resistance mutation pattern of HIV\n\nThe pooled prevalence of PDR was 4.8% (51/1070). Thirty (2.8%; 30/1070)\nof the sequences harbored NNRTI PDRM, which is the highest proposition,\nfollowed by NRTI (1.4%; 15/1070) and PI PDRM (0.8%; 9/1070). NRTI and\nNNRTI concurrent PDRM were observed among two individuals (0.2%; 2/1070)\nof the analyzed sequences (Table ​ (Table1 1 ).\n\nThe K103N NNRTI-associated mutation was the most prevalent observed in\nthis review (17.6%; 9/51), followed by G190A (13.7%; 7/51), K101E (7.8%;\n4/51), Y188C (7.8%; 4/51), and G190S (5.9%; 3/51). Concerning NRTI\nmutations, the most frequent mutations were: K219Q (9.8%; 5/51), L210W\n(7.8%; 4/51), T215S (5.9%; 3/51), and T215FIS (3.9%; 2/51). Among the\nPI-associated major mutations, the I85V mutation was the most prevalent\nmutation observed in this review (5.9%; 3/51), followed by M46I and\nF53L, which were detected in two individuals each (3.9%; 2/51) (Fig. 2\n). Among the individuals who harbored any PDRMs, four harbored more than\none NNRTI-associated mutation, while two harbored more than one\nNRTI-related mutation simultaneously. The remaining 45 individuals only\nharbored a single PDRM at a time. For an extensive review of all\nidentified PDRMs, see Additional file 1 : Table S1.\n\nFig. 2\n\nPrevalence of specific mutations in HIV-1 sequences with any drug\nresistance mutation. The horizontal axis includes all the mutations\nobserved (NNRTI, NRTI, and PI-associated mutations in this review, while\nthe vertical axis represents their respective frequency\n\n### Magnitude and trend of PDR over time\n\nTo assess the trend of PDR over time, we pooled sequences based on the\nsampling year. Accordingly, we were able to observe an increment in PDR\nprevalence from low in 2003 (3.3%) to moderate (5.2%) in 2008--2012.\nThis increase continued and reached 9.8% in 2018, which shows an overall\nincrement in PDR prevalence from 2003 to 2018 (Fig. 3 ). The NNRTI PDRM\nwas the most prevalent mutation observed over the years relative to the\nNRTI and PI PDRMs. The trend of NNRTI, NRTI, and PI PDRMs has increased\nover the years, reaching a peak prevalence in 2018; 7.8%, 1.96%, and\n1.96%, respectively (Fig. 4 ).\n\nFig. 3\n\nPrevalence of PDR over time\n\nFig. 4\n\nPrevalence of NNRTI, NRTI, and PI PDRM over time\n\n### HIV variant dynamics and transmission cluster characteristics\n\nThe REGA HIV subtyping tool indicated that most of the sequences\nanalyzed (97%; 1038/1070) were HIV-1 subtype C virus followed by subtype\nC' (2%; 20/1070), and others (1%; 10/1070) (see Fig. 5 ). Regarding the\ngeographical distribution of the variants in all study areas across the\nnation, the HIV-1 subtype C virus remains the major clade, accounting\nfor more than 97% of the total sequences. The majority (80%) of the\nHIV-1 subtype C-like clade was mainly observed in the northwest of the\ncountry, while the other subtypes were dispersed across the nation.\n\nFig. 5\n\nHIV-1 variant dynamics in Ethiopia\n\nTo depict transmission clusters, the 1070 sequences, along with other\nadditional reference sequences (A-K and CRFs; Table S2 in Additional\nfile 2 ) from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database (\nhttps://www.hiv.lanl.gov/ ) were aligned and a maximum likelihood (ML)\nphylogenetic tree was constructed using Geneious Prime® 2023.0.4\nSoftware ( https://www.geneious.com ). The neighbor-joining method with\n1000 bootstrap replicates under Kimura's 2-parameter correction was\nemployed. Accordingly, we identified 50 transmission clusters in total\n(Fig. 6 ). Those transmission clusters that have a bootstrap value ≥ 90%\nonly are shown in the tree below.\n\nFig. 6\n\nMaximum likelihood phylogenetic tree depicting the transmission\nclusters. The ML tree was constructed using Geneious Prime® 2023.0.4\nwith the Kimura 2 parameter. Bootstrapping was performed with 1000\nreplicates. Transmission clusters with a bootstrap value of 90% and\nabove are seen shaded in red in the tree\n\n## Discussion\n\nCurrently, PDR has become a challenge to the success of ART, which makes\nHIV prevention very difficult. According to the WHO\\'s recent report,\nPDR prevalence is increasing globally \\[ 12 \\]. The same is true for low\nand middle-income countries, which have shown a substantial increment\nrecently \\[ 4 \\]. Therefore, determining PDR at the population level is\ncrucial for optimizing patient and population-level treatment outcomes\nthat will consequently help achieve the third WHO/UNAIDS 90--90--90\ntarget. This review provided the first nationally representative\ndescription of the PDR trend along with the HIV variant dynamics over\nthe years.\n\nThe pooled prevalence of PDR among ART-naïve individuals in Ethiopia in\nthis systematic review was 4.8%, which is low as per the WHO HIV drug\nresistance classification \\[ 11 \\]. This finding is in line with a\nsimilar study from China \\[ 13 , 14 \\], reports from Tanzania \\[ 15 \\],\nand Kenya \\[ 16 \\]. It is, however, lower than the rate of PDR reported\nfrom South Africa \\[ 17 \\], Cameroon \\[ 18 \\], Namibia \\[ 19 \\], Brazil\n\\[ 20 \\], Italy \\[ 21 \\], and England \\[ 22 \\].\n\nThe NNRTI-associated PDRMs were the most frequently observed mutations\nin this review, which corroborates observations from different studies\nacross the globe \\[ 23 -- 28 \\]. This finding supports the recent\ntransition of the ART regimen in Ethiopia from NNRTI to WHO-recommended\nintegrase strand transfer inhibitor-based regimens. The K103N mutation,\nwhich is a non-polymorphic mutation that confers a high-level resistance\nagainst efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP) \\[ 29 , 30 \\], was found in\na high proportion (17.6%; 9/51) from the NNRTI associated PDRMs. This is\nsimilar to reports from Malawi \\[ 26 \\], Israel \\[ 23 \\], Brazil \\[ 20\n\\], Tanzania \\[ 15 \\], Namibia \\[ 19 \\], and Italy \\[ 21 \\]. The G190A\n(13.7%; 7/51) mutation, which is equally selected in persons receiving\nNVP and EFV \\[ 31 , 32 \\] was also a common NNRTI-associated mutation,\nfollowed by the K101E mutation (7.8%; 4/51), Y188C (7.8%; 4/51) and\nG190S (5.9%; 3/51) (Fig. 2 ). The K101E and Y188C mutations are\nassociated with reduced susceptibility to NVP, Etravirine (ETR), and\nRilpivirine (RPV) \\[ 33 -- 35 \\], while Y188C and G190S reduce\nsusceptibility to NVP and EFV \\[ 33 , 35 -- 37 \\].\n\nAmong the NRTI-associated mutations, K219Q and L210W mutations which are\nselected by the thymidine analogs zidovudine (AZT) and Stavudine (d4T),\nwere reported in high frequencies (9.8% (5/51) and 7.8% (4/51)),\nrespectively. In addition to these mutations, others like T215S (5.9%;\n3/51) and T215FIS (3.9%; 2/51) were also observed in this review,\nalthough in relatively lower frequencies. T215S/I mutation is associated\nwith an increased risk of virologic failure associated with AZT or d4T\nusage, while T215F confers reduced susceptibility to all currently\napproved NRTIs except emtricitabine (FTC) and lamivudine (3TC) \\[ 38 \\].\nIt is known that AZT and d4T are commonly used in the country similar to\nother resource-limited settings; hence, the presence of the mentioned\nmutations underscores the need for routine genotypic resistance testing.\n\nProtease inhibitor (PI) mutations are usually observed at lower\nfrequencies in different studies \\[ 23 -- 28 , 39 \\]. Likewise, the\nfrequency of PI mutations is low (0.8%) in this review. The mutations\nobserved are I85V (5.9%; 3/51), which was the most prevalent PI\nmutation, followed by M46I (3.9%; 2/51) and F53L (3.9%; 2/51). The I85V\nis a non-polymorphic mutation selected by Nelfinavir (NFV) and\nAtazanavir (ATV) \\[ 40 , 41 \\] while the M46I and F53L are associated\nwith reduced susceptibility to ATV and Lopinavir (LPV) \\[ 42 , 43 \\].\nM46I, a non-active site mutation in HIV-1 protease, has been clinically\nassociated with saquinavir (SQV) resistance in HIV patients \\[ 44 \\].\nAltogether, the mentioned mutation profile in this review indicates that\nregimens containing NFV, ATV, and LPV are more likely to be effective\nrelative to their NNRTI and/or NRTI counterparts.\n\nConcerning the PDR prevalence per year, the overall PDR prevalence was\nobserved to increase from 3.3% in 2003 to 9.8% in 2018 (Fig. 3 ). The\naccumulation of the PDRMs over time might have led to the upward trend\nof PDR over the years. In line with this finding, a similar increment\nhas also been reported in other studies from Mozambique \\[ 45 \\] and\nSouth Africa \\[ 17 \\]. In addition, the NNRTI-associated PDRMs also\nincreased over time (from 2.19% in 2003 to 7.84% in 2018) (Fig. 4 ),\nwhich is once again similar to observations from other studies around\nthe world \\[ 23 -- 28 , 39 \\].\n\nThe current study confirmed the HIV-1 subtype C virus as the predominant\nclade in Ethiopia, similar to other eastern and southern African\ncountries like South Africa \\[ 46 \\], Mozambique \\[ 45 \\], Malawi \\[ 26\n\\], and Botswana \\[ 47 \\]. This class accounts for 97% of the pandemic\nin the country. Despite being low, the influx of other variants,\nincluding HIV-1 subtype C-like (2%, 20/1070), recombinant of C and A1\n(0.38%, 4/1070), HIV-1 subtype A (A1) (0.38%, 4/1070), HIV-1 subtype D\n(0.09%, 1/1070), HIV-1 CRF 02_AG (0.09%, 1/1070), and recombinant of D\nand A1 (0.09%, 1/1070), has been observed (Fig. 5 ). The occurrence of\nthese other variants indicates the possible introduction of other HIV-1\nsubtypes from neighboring countries. Therefore, preventive measures\nshould always be there to prevent the possibility of further\nintroduction of new subtypes. The 50 transmission clusters found in the\nsequences analyzed suggest that many HIV-positive individuals engage in\nrisky sexual behavior, emphasizing the necessity of a thorough\nunderstanding of the transmission dynamics of HIV-1 subtype C in the\npopulation. An increased public health intervention program aimed at\nthese people is also necessary to stop such potentially risky behaviors\nthat will negatively affect HIV transmission. The current review has\nsome limitations. Firstly, all data used in the analysis were retrieved\nfrom the literature, and hence we were unable to analyze the correlation\nof drug resistance with demographic and clinical characteristics, as\nthis information was not available for the majority of sequences.\nSecondly, in the current review, the studies were mainly from the\ncapital city and from the northern part of the country, and hence some\nregions might have been underrepresented (due to absence of study),\nwhich might lower the representativeness of the study.\n\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn this systematic review, we presented temporal trends of HIV-1 PDR\namong ART-naïve individuals along with HIV-1 variant dynamics in\nEthiopia. Despite the decade-long pandemic, the HIV variant dynamics\nremained the same, with HIV-1 subtype C still accounting for the\nmajority of the clade (\\> 97%). Our analysis showed that the overall\npooled prevalence of PDR is borderline low (4.8%) 15 years after the\nrollout of ART in Ethiopia. However, the trend has been seen to be\nincreasing over the years, which is concerning and indicates the need\nfor routine surveillance of PDRMs along with consecutive preventive\nmeasures in the country. In addition, the observed increasing trend in\nNNRTI PDR supports the recent transition of the ART regimen from NNRTI\nto WHO-recommended integrase strand transfer inhibitor-based regimens.\n\n\n\n## Funding\n\nNo funding received.\n\n\n## Availability of data and materials\n\nAll data generated or analyzed are included in this manuscript and its\nsupplementary information files.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 35061671\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Materials and methods\nWe analyzed 1071 HIV-1 pol-gene fragment sequences (2253–3369 bp) from patients who were initiating or reinitiating first-line ART in six EECA counties, i.e., Armenia (n = 120), Azerbaijan (n = 96), Belarus (n = 158), Russia (n = 465), Tajikistan (n = 54), and Uzbekistan (n = 178), between 2017 and 2019. HIV Pretreatment DR (PDR) and drug resistance mutation (DRM) prevalence was estimated using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database. The PDR level was interpreted according to the WHO standard PDR survey protocols. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database and subsequently confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Transmission clusters were determined using Cluster Picker.\nResults\nAnalyses of HIV subtypes showed that EECA, in general, has the same HIV genetic variants of sub-subtype A6, CRF63_02A1, and subtype B, with different frequencies and representation for each country.\nThe prevalence of PDR to any drug class was 2.8% in Uzbekistan, 4.2% in Azerbaijan, 4.5% in Russia, 9.2% in Armenia, 13.9% in Belarus, and 16.7% in Tajikistan. PDR to protease inhibitors (PIs) was not detected in any country. PDR to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) was not detected among patients in Azerbaijan, and was relatively low in other countries, with the highest prevalence in Tajikistan (5.6%). The prevalence of PDR to nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was the lowest in Uzbekistan (2.8%) and reached 11.1% and 11.4% in Tajikistan and Belarus, respectively.\nGenetic transmission network analyses identified 226/1071 (21.1%) linked individuals, forming 93 transmission clusters mainly containing two or three sequences. We found that the time since HIV diagnosis in clustered patients was significantly shorter than that in unclustered patients (1.26 years vs 2.74 years). Additionally, the K103N/S mutation was mainly observed in clustered sequences (6.2% vs 2.8%).\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance and the genetic analysis of HIV-1 sequences from patient samples. It does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 35283836\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Methods:\nWe analyzed 1,276 Ethiopian HIV-1 subtype C polymerase (pol sequences), including 144 newly generated sequences, collected from different parts of the country from 1986 to 2017. We employed state-of-art maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylodynamic analyses to comprehensively describe the evolutionary dynamics of the HIV-1 epidemic in Ethiopia. We used Bayesian phylodynamic models to estimate the dynamics of the effective population size (N) and reproductive numbers (Re) through time for the HIV epidemic in Ethiopia.\nResults:\nOur analysis revealed that the Ethiopian HIV-1 epidemic originated from two independent introductions at the beginning of the 1970s and 1980s from eastern and southern African countries, respectively, followed by epidemic growth reaching its maximum in the early 1990s. We identified three large clusters with a majority of Ethiopian sequences. Phylodynamic analyses revealed that all three clusters were characterized by high transmission rates during the early epidemic, followed by a decline in HIV-1 transmissions after 1990. Re was high (4–6) during the earlier time of the epidemic but dropped significantly and remained low (Re < 1) after the mid-1990s. Similarly, with an expected shift in time, the effective population size (N) steadily increased until the beginning of 2000, followed by a decline and stabilization until recent years. The phylodynamic analyses corroborated the modeled UNAIDS incidence and prevalence estimates.\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing or data.

We determined the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity in Bulgaria during 2012--2020 using polymerase sequences from 1053 of 2010 (52.4%) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. Sequences were analyzed for DRM using the WHO HIV SDRM list implemented in the calculated population resistance tool at Stanford University. Genetic diversity was inferred using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetics. Cluster detection and characterization was performed using MicrobeTrace. The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%). Most (34/60, 56.7%) of the SDRMs were present in transmission clusters of different subtypes composed mostly of male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC), including a 14-member cluster of subtype B sequences from 12 MMSC and two males reporting heterosexual contact; 13 had the L90M PI mutation and one had the T215S NRTI SDRM. We found a low SDRM prevalence amid high HIV-1 diversity among ART-naive patients in Bulgaria during 2012--2020. The majority of SDRMs were found in transmission clusters containing MMSC, indicative of onward spread of SDRM in drug-naive individuals. Our study provides valuable information on the transmission dynamics of HIV drug resistance in the context of high genetic diversity in Bulgaria, for the development of enhanced prevention strategies to end the epidemic.\n\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity using sequences from ART-naive individuals.

Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences.

In different countries, a significant\nproportion of these cases occur in the adult fertile population aged\n15--49 years. According to UNAIDS, Vietnam had a national HIV prevalence\nof 0.3% of the total population at the end of 2019, with approximately\n230,000 PLHIV. The most effective way to prevent mother-to-child\ntransmission of HIV is ART to reduce maternal viral load. HIV-infected\npregnant women should undergo monthly monitoring, especially before the\nexpected date of delivery. The aim of our work was to analyze subtypic\nstructure and drug-resistant variants of HIV in pregnant women in Ho Chi\nMinh City. The study material was blood plasma samples from HIV-infected\npregnant women: 31 women showed virological failure of ART, and 30 women\nhad not previously received therapy. HIV-1 genotyping and mutation\ndetection were performed based on analysis of the nucleotide sequences\nof the *pol* gene region. More than 98% of sequences genotyped as HIV-1\nsub-subtype CRF01_AE. When assessing the occurrence of drug resistance\nmutations, genetic resistance to any drug was detected in 74.41% (95%\nCI: 62.71--85.54%) of patients. These included resistance mutations to\nprotease inhibitors in 60.66% (95% CI: 47.31--72.93%) of patients, to\nNRTIs in 8.20% (95% CI: 2.72--18.10%), and to NNRTIs in 44.26% (95% CI:\n31.55--57.52%). Mutations associated with NRTI (2) and NNRTI (8)\nresistance as well as PI mutations (12), including minor ones, were\nidentified. The high prevalence of drug resistance mutations found in\nthis study among pregnant women, both in therapeutically naive\nindividuals and in patients with virological failure of ART, indicates\nthat currently used regimens in Vietnam are insufficient to prevent\nvertical HIV infection.\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods\n\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Saint Petersburg\nPasteur Institute.\n\nThe study material was blood plasma samples collected in 2021 from 61\npregnant women in need of PMTCT in Ho Chi Minh City with a viral load\nabove 500 copies per ml of blood plasma. The blood plasma after taking\nthe material from women was sampled, and then sent to the Pasteur\nInstitute in Ho Chi Minh City, where it was frozen at −70 °C. After the\nsampling was completed, the frozen plasma was transported to St.\nPetersburg, where molecular biological studies were carried out. In the\nsurveyed group, 31 women showed virological failure of ART, and 30 women\nhad not previously received therapy. All samples were transferred\nanonymously.\n\nMolecular genetic studies were carried out at the Pasteur Institute in\nSt. Petersburg. Quantitative analysis of HIV RNA was carried out with a\ncommercial kit, AmpliSens ^®^ HIV-Monitor-FRT (Central Research\nInstitute of Epidemiology, Moscow, Russia) with a sensitivity threshold\nof 500 copies/mL. For samples with a detectable viral load, reverse\ntranscription and PCR were performed, followed by Sanger sequencing\nusing the AmpliSens HIVResist-Seq (Central Research Institute of\nEpidemiology, Moscow, Russia) commercial kit \\[ 14 \\]. HIV-1 genotyping\nwas performed based on analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the 1285\nnt *pol* gene region encoding the protease (PR) and part of the reverse\ntranscriptase (RT) in the 2085--3369 nt region. The coordinates given\nare for HIV HXB2 in the GenBank database ( K03455.1 ). Sequencing\nreaction products were analyzed using an ABI Prism 3500 genetic analyzer\n(Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA).\n\nNucleotide sequences were aligned using the MEGA 7.0 program using the\nClustalW algorithm \\[ 15 \\]. To construct phylogenetic trees and\nsubsequent phylogenetic analysis, the neighbor-joining algorithm was\nused, which makes it possible to optimize trees in accordance with the\nbalanced minimum evolution criterion. When assessing the reliability of\nphylogenetic relationships, we used multiple generation of samples using\nthe bootstrap method for 1000 independent constructions of each\nphylogenetic tree. Genotyping of the studied strains was carried out in\nparallel using the REGA HIV-1 Subtyping Tool 3.0 program \\[ 16 \\] based\non analysis of phylogenetic relationships with reference sequences from\nthe GenBank international database. Analysis of HIV-1 genetic sequences\nfor the presence of drug resistance mutations was performed using the\nStanford database \\[ 17 \\]. Mutation profiles were analyzed by\nconstructing line diagrams using Linear Diagram Generator software \\[ 18\n\\].\n\nStatistical data processing was carried out using the MS Excel 2016 and\nPrizm 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) software\npackages. The \"exact\" Clopper--Pearson interval was used to estimate\nstatistical uncertainty. Results are represented as a proportion\nindicating 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The Fisher exact test or\nYates-corrected chi-squared test was used to evaluate the statistical\nsignificance of numeric data obtained during paired comparison depending\non sample characteristics. A probability value of *p* \\< 0.05 was taken\nas the statistical threshold of significance.\n\n## 3. Results\n\nThe nucleotide sequences of 61 HIV-1 samples were obtained and deposited\nin GenBank (numbers OQ215322-OQ215382 ). The subtype was determined for\nall samples ( Table 1 ). For this, data obtained by genotyping using the\nREGA HIV Subtyping Tool 3.0, the jumping profile Hidden Markov Model\n(jpHMM), and the results of a phylogenetic study ( Figure 1 ) were used.\n\nFigure 1\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of viral nucleotide sequences (HIV *pol* gene\nfragment) from HIV-infected pregnant women in Vietnam relative to\nGenBank reference sequences. Reference sequences are designated by\nGenBank codes indicating the sample genotype. Strains studied in this\nwork are marked as follows: triangles---samples from patients with\nvirologically ineffective ART; circles---samples from patients who had\nnot previously received therapy. Bootstrap values ≥70% are given.\n\nWhen assessing the occurrence of drug resistance mutations, genetic\nresistance to any drug was detected in 74.41% (95% CI: 62.71--85.54%) of\npatients. These included resistance mutations to protease inhibitors in\n60.66% (95% CI: 47.31--72.93%) of patients, to NRTIs in 8.20% (95% CI:\n2.72--18.10%), and to NNRTIs in 44.26% (95% CI: 31.55--57.52%).\nMutations associated with NRTI (2) and NNRTI (8) resistance as well as\nPI mutations (12), including minor ones, were identified.\n\nNRTI mutations were present only in women with virological failure of\nART. PI and NNRTI mutations were also detected in therapeutically naive\npatients. The prevalence values of HIV drug resistance mutations to PIs\nand NNRTIs in the examined group are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 ,\nrespectively.\n\nFigure 2\n\nMost common HIV drug resistance mutations to PIs in HIV-infected\npregnant women in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\n\nFigure 3\n\nMost common HIV drug resistance mutations to NNRTIs in HIV-infected\npregnant women in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\n\nThe occurrence of mutations in the studied subgroups was not the same (\nTable 2 ).\n\nBy analyzing multiple mutation profiles by constructing line diagrams,\nit is possible to trace emerging stable patterns of drug resistance\nmutations ( Figure 4 and Figure 5 ).\n\nFigure 4\n\nOverall analysis of multiple mutation profiles by line diagram.

Therapeutically\nnaive individuals ( **A** ) and individuals with failure ART ( **B** ).\nMutation profiles are distributed along the horizontal axis.\n\nThe prevalence of any mutation in women with virological failure of ART\nwas significantly higher (93.55%, 95% CI: 78.58--99.21%) than in women\nwho had not previously received treatment (56.67%, 95% CI:\n37.43--74.54%), with the values χ ^2^ = 9.283, *p* = 0.0023, df = 1, and\nRR = 4.728 (CI: 1.277--17.513). In addition, polymorphic mutations were\nseen in both examined subgroups, while non-polymorphic drug resistance\nmutations were noted predominantly in individuals with ineffective ART\n(67.74%, 95% CI: 48.63--83.32%). The incidence of DR mutations in\ntherapeutically naive individuals was also extremely high for this\ngroup, 10% (95% CI: 2.11--26.53%). However, the relative risk of\ndeveloping DR mutations in individuals with virological failure of ART\nwas significantly higher than in those who had not received treatment,\nwith the values χ ^2^ = 18.949, *p* \\< 0.0001, df = 1, and RR = 3.238\n(CI: 1.866--5.616).\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nThe results obtained have a number of limitations and, undoubtedly,\nrequire further refinement. The main limitation is the small size of the\nstudied sample of patients. Some difficulty in interpreting the data is\ncreated by the poor availability of some information from the anamnesis,\nincluding the complete anonymity of the samples transmitted to us for\nwork. Nevertheless, based on the obtained results, it is possible to\nmake a number of assumptions, conducting a comparative analysis with\nother information presented in the literature.\n\nIt is known that CRF01_AE was the first-described circulating\nrecombinant form of HIV-1. Moreover, although the genetic variant was\nfirst identified in Thailand, its origin from African countries has been\ndetermined \\[ 19 \\]. However, the highest prevalence of CRF01_AE has\nbeen shown in Southeast Asian countries \\[ 20 \\]. Our results (98.36%\nCRF01_AE, 1.64% C) differ slightly from the distribution of HIV genetic\nvariants shown earlier in Vietnam. For example, in central Vietnam among\nHIV-infected individuals from different risk groups, CRF01_AE prevailed\n(97.5%) compared to genotype B (2.5%); despite an absence of therapy in\nthese patients, 32.5% had at least one drug resistance mutation \\[ 21\n\\]. We showed a similar structure of HIV genotypes when examining\npatients with virological failure of ART from Ho Chi Minh City: the\ncirculating recombinant form CRF01_AE (92.2%) prevailed compared to\ngenotype B (5.3%), and CRF08_BC was detected in one patient (2.6%) \\[ 22\n\\]. In the present study, we did not detect HIV genotypes B or CRF08_BC,\nwhich may be due to the limited sample size. Thus, the predominance of\nthis HIV genetic variant in the examined group does not contradict the\npreviously obtained data in general \\[ 23 \\]. The predominant prevalence\nof HIV CRF01_AE is also shown in neighboring countries of Vietnam \\[ 24\n\\]. For example, in Cambodia, which has one of the highest HIV\nprevalence among pregnant women in the Asia--Pacific Region, about 94%\nof patients with newly diagnosed HIV infection were infected with the\nCRF01_AE genovariant \\[ 25 \\]. In Laos, 91.8% of HIV cases were\nCRF01_AE, and 8.2% of the strains were identified as a new circulating\nrecombinant form of CRF97_01B; moreover, according to phylogeographic\nanalysis, HIV CRF01_AE in Laos is the result of repeated importation of\nthe virus from Thailand \\[ 26 \\]. Generally, in Cambodia, Thailand,\nVietnam, and China, the proportion of HIV-1 infections due to\nrecombinants is more than 95% of cases \\[ 27 \\]. At the same time,\naccording to a retrospective study, in general, in the countries of the\nAsia--Pacific Region, HIV genotype C (49%) prevailed compared to\ngenotype A1 (22%) and CRF01_AE (17%) \\[ 28 \\]. These differences appear\nto be related to the characteristics of the patient groups in each\nstudy.\n\nOur study, already mentioned above, showed a high prevalence of drug\nresistance mutations among individuals with virological failure of ART\n(76.2%), but strains with DR mutations to all three ARV groups\nsimultaneously were not detected \\[ 22 \\]. In the present study, three\ncases with mutations to NRTIs and NNRTIs were identified among people\nwith failure ART with a mutation in the protease region. However, in all\nthese cases, mutations in the protease region were polymorphic amino\nacid substitutions that increase the ability of the virus to replicate.\nWe previously reported that the number of naturally occurring polymorphs\nin this region among ART users ranged from 17 to 35 mutations and also\ndepended on the number of ART regimens. It was shown that ≥23\npolymorphic variants in patients with two or three ART regimens are more\ncommon than in patients with one regimen, with the values χ ^2^ = 3.149,\n*p* = 0.035, df = 1, and Pearson's normalized contingency coefficient C′\n= 0.459. This indicates a relatively strong relationship between a\nhigher number of ART regimens and the number of polymorphic variants in\nthe analyzed *pol* gene fragment \\[ 22 \\].\n\nIn the present study, polymorphic mutations were found to be fewer, most\nlikely due to the lack of ART or the single therapy regimen that women\nreceived. The results obtained indirectly confirm the assumption that a\nlarge number of ART regimens contribute not only to the development of\ndrug resistance mutations, but also to an increase in the frequency of\nviral polymorphic variants. As is known, HIV genotypes have their own\nmolecular genetic features which affect, among other things, sensitivity\nto ART. In Vietnam, available three-drug first-line ART regimens meet\nWHO standards: two NRTIs (stavudine (d4T)/lamivudine (3TC) or zidovudine\n(AZT)/lamivudine) together with one NNRTI (nevirapine (NVP) or efavirenz\n(EFV)). It is known that the effectiveness of ART is affected by the\nviral genotype, as well as HIV mutations present before the start of\ntreatment \\[ 29 \\]. For the CRF01_AE genotype, which is the most common\nin Vietnam (according to both the literature data and our results), the\nfollowing mutations are among the most commonly described: L33F, M46I,\nand M46L (associated with DR to protease inhibitors); M41L, A62V, M184V,\nand T215Y (associated with DR to NRTI); and K103N, V108I, and G190A\n(associated with DR to NNRTI) \\[ 30 , 31 \\].\n\nIn the examined strains, however, the NRTI mutations M41L, A62V, and\nT215Y were not found; the most common was M184V/I at 6.56% (95% CI:\n1.82--15.95%). Among NNRTI mutations in our isolates, K103N and Y181C\nprevailed with 13.11% each (95% CI: 5.84--24.22%), while the V108I and\nG190A substitutions were not detected. Mutations L33F, M46I, and M46L\nwere not found among PI mutations in the studied sequences. The most\ncommon mutations in our study group were polymorphic substitutions in\nthe protease region, K20R (27.87%, CI: 17.15--40.83%) and I10I/V\n(21.31%, CI: 11.86--33.68%), which increase the replication of viruses\nwith other PI-resistance mutations. Mutations of drug resistance to the\nprotease inhibitor darunavir have been identified. The V11I/L mutations\nare relatively additional mutations selected from individuals receiving\nDRV. The V11L is a PI-selective mutation associated with reduced\nsusceptibility to DRV in vitro when it occurs in combination with other\nPI-resistance mutations. In three women (4.92%), we identified the I50V\nmutation, selected by FPV, LPV, DRV, and reduced susceptibility to LPV\nand DRV. Thus, prevailing mutations of pharmacological resistance among\nthe studied isolates were to lamivudine and emtricitabine (M184V); to\ndelavirdine, nevirapine, and efavirenz (K103N); and to nevirapine,\nefavirenz, etravirine, and rilpivirine (Y181C). This high prevalence of\ndrug resistance mutations for the most commonly used drugs is not\nsurprising but is a concern as it limits their use in downstream\nregimens, especially given resistance to newer-generation drugs such as\netravirine \\[ 32 \\].\n\nIt should be noted that some polymorphic variants of the virus can also\naffect resistance to therapy, as well as the replication activity of the\nvirus \\[ 33 \\]. In the examined group, mutations were found in the V82I\nprotease region (a highly polymorphic mutation that is not selected by\nthe PI). The V82L mutation results in moderate levels of resistance to\nNFV and TPV, as well as low levels of resistance to ATV, FPV, and SQV \\[\n34 \\]. A mutation at position 82 usually occurs simultaneously with a\nsubstitution at position 88. However, in our study, none of the isolates\nwith the V82L mutation showed an amino acid substitution at position 88.\nAt the same time, in all these isolates, the L89M polymorphism was\ndetected, which contributes to resistance to a number of protease\ninhibitor drugs \\[ 35 \\]. An amino acid substitution at this position of\nL89T occurs in 8.4% of non-B subtype sequences but only in 0.4% of B\nsubtype sequences \\[ 36 \\]. The absence of a substitution at position 88\nsimultaneously with polymorphism 82, but the presence of a\ntherapeutically significant substitution at position 89 may be\nassociated with the features of CRF01_AE, which needs further research.\nNote the T74S polymorphism found in some patients (is an additional\nmutation selected by PI that is polymorphic in most subtypes).\nInterestingly, the T74S amino acid substitution has not been described\nas being associated with drug resistance, but a mutation at this\nposition in T74P is known to cause resistance to darunavir/ritonavir and\ntipranavir/ritonavir \\[ 35 \\]. At the same time, although the T74S\npolymorphism itself does not affect the resistance of the virus, its\npresence in strains with multiple resistance restores sensitivity to\nindinavir, ritonavir, and partially to lopinavir \\[ 37 \\]. The Q58E\nmutation has been identified. The Q58E mutation---a minimum polymorphic\nadditional mutation selected by each of the PIs except DRV---in\ncombination with other PI resistance mutations, may contribute to low\nlevels of ATV resistance. Lopinavir/ritonavir is recommended as\nsecond-line therapy, for which one of the major Q58E mutations has\nlittle effect. Due to the lack of influence of Q58E on the sensitivity\nof strains to LPV/r, this mutation can serve as one of the markers for\nthe transmission of specific quasi-species \\[ 38 \\]. In addition, the\nhigh occurrence of polymorphic substitutions may indicate an active\nmutational process, as a result of which the active use of PI when using\nfirst- or second-line regimens that include ineffective drugs can\npotentially lead to the development of cross-resistance to modern drugs\nused in the second and third therapy regimens, such as darunavir \\[ 39\n\\]. This is due to the fact that the development of resistance to IP is\ncumulative, representing a gradual accumulation of amino acid\nsubstitutions \\[ 40 \\].\n\nThe most common drug resistance mutations in our study cohort are\nconsistent with other investigators' evaluations of DR mutations in this\ngeographic region \\[ 41 \\]. So, in a retrospective study evaluating HIV\ntesting results in individuals with virologic failure in countries of\nthe Asia--Pacific Region, a high prevalence of drug resistance mutations\nwas shown: 80% had at least one NNRTI mutation, 63% to NRTI and 35% to\nPI. The most common mutations to NNRTI were K103N (25%) and Y181C (25%);\nto NRTI-M184V (55%), M41L (35%) and D67N (28%); and to PI-I50L (10%),\nQ58E (10%), N88S (10%), and L90M (10%) \\[ 23 \\].\n\nVertical transmission of HIV is primarily associated with infection\nduring the last weeks of pregnancy and in the perinatal period. In this\ncase, a significant role is played not only by high maternal HIV viral\nloads but also by drug resistance mutations \\[ 42 \\]. Our results\nindicate the need to change ART in a significant number of pregnant\nwomen. Our study shows a high prevalence of DR mutations both in women\nwith virological failure of ART and, to a lesser extent, in women who\nhave not previously received treatment. Thus, due to time constraints,\nit is necessary to detect DR mutations before initiation of therapy in\norder to avoid prescribing drugs to which the virus is resistant.\nHowever, the high cost of testing may be a barrier to screening for DR\nmutations in Vietnam. In this case, attention should be paid to the\npossibility of using drugs for the prevention of infection in children\nthat were not received by their mothers and which cannot have cross-drug\nresistance. Foremost, integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs),\nwhich have a high genetic barrier to drug resistance, should be\nconsidered \\[ 43 \\]. INSTIs are recommended as the preferred ART\ncomponents for initiation of therapy due to their efficacy, safety, and\nrelative ease of use \\[ 44 \\].\n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions\n\nThe high prevalence of drug resistance mutations found in this study\namong pregnant women, both in treatment-naive individuals and in\npatients with virological failure of ART, may indicate that currently\nused regimens in Vietnam are insufficient to prevent vertical\ntransmission of HIV. Our results indirectly confirm the need to include\nintegrase inhibitors in the first ART regimen, especially in pregnant\nwomen, parturient women, and newborns. However, it is important to note\nthe main limitation of this study---a small sample size. Therefore, it\nis necessary to conduct a similar but larger-scale study. Nevertheless,\nthe analysis of the prevalence of drug resistance mutations among\npregnant women remains a necessary and mandatory step in HIV monitoring.\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThis research received no external funding.\n\n\n## Data Availability Statement\n\nData available on request from the authors.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 20718620\nQuestion ID: 12\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\nEvidence: We also analyzed the amino acid sequences for the presence of drug resistance mutations according to the last update of the WHO list for the surveillance of drug resistance mutations in antiretroviral-naive patients (SDRM version 2009, http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/WHOResistanceList.html).

CHIV ages 1--14 years\nenrolled from March 2019 to December 2020 from five facilities in Kisumu\nCounty, Kenya, were included. Children were randomized 1:1 to control\n(standard-of-care) or intervention (point-of-care viral load (POC VL)\ntesting every three months with targeted genotypic drug resistance\ntesting (DRT) for virologic failure (VF) (≥1000 copies/mL)). A\nmultidisciplinary committee reviewed CHIV with DRT results and offered\ntreatment recommendations. We describe DR mutations and present logistic\nregression models to identify factors associated with clinically\nsignificant DR. We enrolled 704 children in the study; the median age\nwas 9 years (interquartile range (IQR) 7, 12), 344 (49%) were female,\nand the median time on ART was 5 years (IQR 3, 8). During the study\nperiod, 106 (15%) children had DRT results (84 intervention and 22\ncontrol). DRT detected mutations associated with DR in all participants\ntested, with 93 (88%) having major mutations, including 51 (54%) with\ndual-class resistance. A history of VF in the prior 2 years (adjusted\nodds ratio (aOR) 11.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.3, 20.0) and less\nthan 2 years on ART at enrollment (aOR 2.2; 95% CI 1.1, 4.4) were\nassociated with increased odds of major DR. DR is highly prevalent among\nCHIV on ART with VF in Kenya. Factors associated with drug resistance\nmay be used to determine which children should be prioritized for DRT.\n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods\n\nThe Optimizing Viral Suppression in Children on ART in Kenya (Opt4Kids)\nstudy protocol and primary findings have been described previously \\[ 18\n, 19 \\]. In brief, 704 CHIV ages 1--14 years were enrolled from 5 public\nfacilities in Kisumu County, Kenya, between March and December 2019 and\nwere followed for 12 months. Children were individually randomized 1:1,\nstratified by site and age groups (ages 1--9 years and 10--14 years), to\nthe control (standard-of-care) or intervention groups (point-of-care\nviral load testing every three months with DRT for those with VF (HIV\nRNA ≥ 1000 copies/mL)) and followed for 12 months. Participants in both\ngroups underwent point-of-care (POC) viral load (VL) testing and\ntargeted DRT, if indicated, at 12 months post-enrollment.\n\n### 2.1. Study Procedures\n\nWhole blood was collected from study participants for POC VL testing and\nseparated into plasma for testing using a GeneXpert system (Cepheid,\nNairobi, Kenya) on site at study facilities or via daily transport to a\nfacility less than 2 km away \\[ 20 \\]. The study facilities participated\nin a quarterly external quality assurance program for HIV POC VL testing\nusing GeneXpert, and each facility passed each check. HIV DR testing was\nperformed on plasma samples using Sanger sequencing with Applied\nBiosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzers (ThermoFisher Scientific, Nairobi,\nKenya) at the KEMRI-CDC HIV Research and Sanger 3730xl at the Kenya\nNational HIV Reference Laboratories. These laboratories utilize\nvalidated, WHO-certified, optimized in-house assays to detect reverse\ntranscriptase and PI mutations \\[ 21 , 22 \\]. Integrase strand transfer\ninhibitor (INSTI) mutations were not routinely evaluated during the\nstudy period. The DRT result reports contained a list of the DR\ngenotypes as well as phenotypic interpretations based on the scoring\nsystems generated by the Stanford Genotypic Resistance Interpretation\nAlgorithm (Stanford Univeristy, Palo Alto, CA, USA) versions available\nduring the study period \\[ 23 \\].\n\nChildren in the intervention group underwent DRT at episodes of VF\ndetection. A multidisciplinary committee, called the Clinical Management\nCommittee (CMC), which included facility providers and peer leaders, HIV\nimplementing partner technical advisors, the chairperson of the local\nHIV Technical Working Group, and study principal investigators, reviewed\nthe DRT results to provide interpretation and clinical management\nrecommendations. The CMC utilized a standardized Kenya Ministry of\nHealth (MoH) case summary form, prepared by facility providers and\nresearch staff in advance of the CMC review, to discuss the cases. The\nCMC met as the DRT results were available, often weekly, throughout the\nstudy period. The CMC recommendations were summarized orally during\nvirtual meetings and shared in writing along with the DRT results to\nfacility providers within one week.\n\nFor children in the control group, providers were instructed to follow\ncurrent Kenya MoH guidelines for the management of any child with VF,\nwhich recommended enhanced adherence counseling for children with VF and\nrepeat viral load (VL) testing after three months of provider-determined\n\"good\" adherence. DRT was limited to patients approved by the regional\nHIV Technical Working Group and generally included those failing a\nPI-containing regimen or with persistent VF despite good adherence. The\nTechnical Working Group reviewed case summaries and DRT results, when\navailable, and provided guidance to facility staff on patient\nmanagement, though facility staff did not participate in working group\nmeetings. In practice, only two control group participants had DRT\nresults which were received after the study end. Therefore, DRT results\nfrom control group participants prior to the final study visit were\nexcluded from this analysis. At the study end, participants in the\ncontrol group underwent intervention procedures, including CMC review\nfor those with DRT results.\n\n### 2.2. Study Setting\n\nFirst-line ART regimens in Kenya during the study period for children\nincluded lamivudine with either abacavir (preferred) or zidovudine\n(alternative) and lopinavir/ritonavir for those less than three years of\nage and lamivudine with either abacavir (preferred) or zidovudine\n(alternative) and efavirenz for those three years of age and older \\[ 24\n\\]. Second-line ART regimens included changes in NRTI medication from\nabacavir to zidovudine or vice versa depending on which the child was on\nas first-line with maintenance of lamivudine. Those on\nlopinavir/ritonavir as first-line required review by the HIV Technical\nWorking Group to recommend a second-line regimen, while those on\nefavirenz were recommended to switch to lopinavir/ritonavir. In 2020,\nthe guidelines were updated to recommend dolutegravir (DTG) for those\nweighing at least 20 kg for treatment initiation and optimization\n(switch to DTG-containing regimen regardless of viral load), which was\nrolled out during the study period \\[ 25 \\].\n\n### 2.3. Study Population\n\nChildren 1--14 years of age, enrolled at a study site, on or initiating\nART, and with a consenting caregiver were enrolled to the study.\nParticipant characteristics at enrollment have been previously published\n\\[ 26 \\]. Of note, 536 (76%) were virally suppressed, 77 (11%) had VF,\n91 (13%) had missing VL data, and 20 participants newly initiated ART\nwithin 30 days of study enrollment. HIV care and treatment were provided\nby government staff as per national guidelines.\n\n### 2.4. Data Collection and Management\n\nWe abstracted routinely collected data from standardized Ministry of\nHealth forms in medical files and registers using direct, electronic\ndata entry via tablets into a REDCap database. Similarly, we entered\nstudy-collected data, including DRT results, in this REDCap database.\n\n### 2.5. Primary Analytic Outcome\n\nA participant was considered to have clinically significant DR if they\nhad any mutation listed for NRTI and NNRTI drugs with a penalty score or\nif listed as \"major\" for PIs by Stanford's Genotypic Resistance\nInterpretation Algorithm (i.e., Stanford HIVdb) on any DRT \\[ 23 \\].\n\n### 2.6. Exposures and Covariates\n\nWe selected potential risk factors a priori, based on the existing\nliterature and content knowledge, which included age, sex, duration on\nART, prior ARV exposure, and prior history of VF \\[ 27 , 28 \\]. History\nof VF was defined as any VL result ≥ 1000 copies/mL within two years\nprior to study enrollment. Given the exploratory nature of this\nanalysis, we also included the following covariates: WHO stage,\nself-reported HIV status of primary caregiver at enrollment,\nsocioeconomic status (household commodities ownership), urban,\nperi-urban, or rural clinic location, and clinic volume defined as high,\nmedium, and low based on the number of HIV patient visits per month at\neach facility.\n\n### 2.7. Statistical Analysis\n\nFirst, we describe the proportion of participants from either group who\nunderwent DRT as part of the study intervention or at the study end, per\nprotocol, and the proportion with DR mutations detected by HIV drug\nclasses, e.g., NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs. All DRTs for each participant\nwere reviewed, but only one DRT result contributed to the data analysis.\nFor a report of DRMs by drug class, the DRT with the highest number of\nmutations was used. We report on the prevalence of HIV DR by ARV\nmedication using WHO's definition of a penalty score of ≥15 using the\nStandford HIVdb algorithm \\[ 6 , 23 \\]. We estimated the prevalence of\nthe most common DR mutations (K65R, L74V/I, Y115F, M184V, K103N, Y181C,\nG190A) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\n\nSecond, to evaluate which CHIV were most likely to have clinically\nrelevant DR, we used logistic regression models to identify factors\nassociated with clinically significant DR. Variables with *p* -values \\<\n0.20 in univariate analyses were included in the multivariate model.\n\nThird, to explore any potential impact of DRT on clinical outcomes, we\nreport descriptive statistics for outcomes including viral suppression\n(VS), loss to follow up, and death by study group among those with DRT\nresults, categorized by whether an ART regimen change occurred or not.\n\n\n\n## 3. Results\n\nA total of 704 children were enrolled in the study with a median age 9\nyears (interquartile range (IQR) 7, 12); 344 (49%) were female, and the\nmedian time on ART was 5 years (IQR 3, 8). A total of 349 (49.5%) and\n355 (50.5%) of the CHIV were randomized to the intervention and control\ngroups, respectively. Overall, 382 (54.3%) of the participants were on\nan NNRTI-containing regimen at study enrollment, 294 (41.8%) were on a\nPI-containing regimen, 27 (3.8%) were on an INSTI-containing regimen,\nand 1 (0.1%) was on a PI and INSTI regimen ( Table 1 ).\n\nDuring the 12-month study period, 190 study DRTs were requested for 106\n(15%) participants across the two study groups. Among the intervention\nparticipants, 88 (25%) children experienced at least one episode of VF,\nand all had a least one DRT requested for a total of 166 DRT requests,\nand 152 (92%) had results. ( Figure 1 ) A total of 66 (19%) children in\nthe control group had a least one episode of viremia. as per the study\nprotocol, those with VF identified at the 12-month study visit were\nincluded in the analysis ( *n* = 24), all of whom had a study DRT\nrequested, of which 22 (92%) had results.\n\nFigure 1\n\nOpt4Kids study participants undergoing drug resistance testing by study\ngroup. ^1^ Note, categories for exclusion not mutually exclusive. ^2^\nProtocol changed to allow for enrollment of second-line ART. ^3^ DRT\nrequests per study protocol only. ^4^ There were additional DRT\nfailures, but those participants had at least one successful DRT. See\ntext for details. ART---antiretroviral treatment; POC---point of care;\nVL---viral load; DR---drug resistance; DRT---drug resistance test;\ncpm---copies per milliliter.\n\nOf the total 190 DRTs requested by the study, 16 (9%) total samples from\n16 participants did not yield a result, with 14 (87%) samples failing to\namplify and 2 (13%) having insufficient volume to be tested. Fourteen\nparticipants in the intervention group had a \"failed\" result, of whom\nten (71%) had a successful subsequent repeat DRT. An additional three\n(21%) intervention participants re-suppressed to VL \\< 1000/mL and had\nno further indication for DR testing. Two children in the control group\nwho had DRT performed at 12-month visit per protocol that failed to\namplify were referred for repeat of DRT by facility staff via routine\ncare.\n\n### 3.1. Drug Resistance among Children on ART with Virologic Failure\n\nAmong the one hundred and six participants with at least one DRT result,\nall demonstrated at least one clinically significant mutation or minor\nDR mutation, as defined by the Stanford HIV Database. A total of 93\n(87.7%) had clinically significant mutations, and 13 (12.3%) had minor\nmutations only ( Table 1 ). In the 93 children with clinically\nsignificant resistance, 87 (93.5%) had NNRTI resistance, 70 (75.3%) had\nNRTI resistance, and 10 (10.8%) had PI resistance. Additionally, more\nthan half of the children with significant resistance had dual-class\nresistance to NRTI and NNRTIs ( *n* = 51, 54.8%), two (2.2%) had\ndual-class resistance with either NRTI or NNRTI and PIs, and eight\n(8.6%) had triple-class resistance to NRTI, NNRTI, and PIs. The most\ncommon DR mutations identified were among NRTI and NNRTIs, with most\ncommon being M184V (57.5%, 95% CI 48%, 67%) followed by K103N (35.8%,\n95% CI 27%, 45%) ( Table 2 ). Additional descriptions of DR by drug\nclass are shown in Figure 2 . Over half of those with DRT results\ndemonstrated DR to abacavir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, efavirenz, and\nnevirapine, while over 10% had resistance to zidovudine and tenofovir (\nFigure 3 ). DR to newer-generation NNRTIs was also high, with 43.5%\nhaving DR to rilpivirine and fewer having DR to etravirine (66.0%) and\ndoravirine (20.0%).\n\nFigure 2\n\nDescription of HIV drug resistance mutations among children on ART with\nvirologic failure. *N* = number of children with resistance in the\nrespective drug class(es).

Only three participants initially had minor\nresistance and later had clinically significant resistance on repeat\nDRT. Similarly, only six children went from a single class with\nresistance to two or more drug classes. No children with a change in\nresistance on follow-up DRT had ART regimen changes between DRTs.\n\n### 3.2. Characteristics Associated with Major Drug Resistance\n\nThe associations between participant characteristics and clinically\nsignificant DRs are shown in Table 3 . Younger children 1--4 years of\nage had three-fold higher odds of clinically significant DR compared to\nolder children aged 5--10 years or 11--14 years demonstrated (odds ratio\n(OR) 3.2, 95% CI 1.6, 6.1). Similarly, those on ART for \\<2 years and\nchildren on a PI-containing regimen at enrollment or first DRT had\nhigher odds of major DR (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.7--4.9, OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2,\n2.0, and OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2,3.0, respectively) ( Table 3 ). Further, a\nhistory of virologic failure in the 2 years prior to study enrollment\nwas associated with a nearly 11-fold increased odds of major DR compared\nto no prior VF (95% CI 6.6, 18.5). In an adjusted analysis, time on ART\nand history of virologic failure remained significantly associated with\nmajor DR. There were no associations with the type of primary caregiver\n(e.g., mother, father, other family, or non-family member), the HIV\nstatus of the primary caregiver, household socioeconomic status, or\nfacility volume or location between groups.\n\n### 3.3. Clinical Management and Outcomes of Children with DRT\n\nThe CMC carried out case reviews for all participants with DRT results\nand recommended an ART regimen change for 46 (43%) out of the 106\nparticipants with a DRT. In the control group, 22 participants had a DRT\nafter the 12-month study visit, and 100% had any DR with 19 (86%) with\nmajor DR. Eight of those with results (36.4%) had a recommendation for\nan ART regimen change after clinical review. The control group\nparticipants were not followed beyond this final study visit.\n\nIn the intervention group, 38/88 (43.2%) were recommended to change ART\nafter a case review, while 34 (38.6%) were advised to continue the\ncurrent regimen. An additional 12 (13.6%) intervention participants\nunderwent an ART change due to a national transition to dolutegravir\nthat was initiated by the clinic providers. Of those with an ART change\nrecommendation in the intervention group, 35 (92.1%) had changed to the\nrecommended ART by the study end. All the intervention participants with\nan ART change recommendation had clinically significant DR. Nearly a\nthird ( *n* = 11, 28.9%) with an ART change recommendation were advised\nto change the non-NRTI ARV but were able to preserve their current NRTI\nmedications based on DRT results, which would have otherwise been\nswitched as per in-country guidelines. A total of 31/34 (91.2%) children\nwho did not have an ART change recommendation had major DR, but their\ncurrent regimen was still evaluated to be effective. Most of the\nchildren 27/34 (79.4%) without an ART regimen change recommendation were\non a PI-containing regimen without major PI resistance and with no\nage-appropriate available medication alternatives (e.g., dolutegravir\nformulation not available or recommended for age at time of study). An\nadditional three older participants were on an INSTI-containing regimen\n(specifically dolutegravir), and four were on an NNRTI (specifically\nefavirenz) without DR impacting the current regimen.\n\nFor the intervention participants with DRT prior to the final study\nvisit ( *n* = 77), 32 (42%) were virally suppressed at the study end (\nTable 4 ). Viral suppression (VS) at the 12-month visit was observed in\n21/36 (58%) of patients with a recommendation to change ART and in 12/31\n(39%) recommended to not change ART ( *p* = 0.40). Additionally, VS was\nobserved in 9/10 (90%) of patients with a programmatic switch to DTG.\nLoss to follow up was higher in those without an ART change\nrecommendation ( *n* = 6, 19%) compared to those with an ART change\nrecommendation ( *n* = 3, 8%) ( *p* = 0.28). One child died in the study\nwho had VF and a DRT result that did not result in an ART change\nrecommendation.\n\n\nIn this cohort of over 700 children on ART in Kenya, we detected high\nlevels of DR in CHIV with VF. All children with VF had some DR, the\nmajority of whom had major DR. Children on ART for \\>2 years and those\nwith a history of VF were significantly more likely to have major DR. We\nobserved that half of the CHIV with DR re-suppressed by the study end\nfollowing the use of a multidisciplinary care team approach for case\nreview and clinical management recommendations. Our study provides data\non evolving DR patterns in CHIV and can inform prioritization approaches\nof DRT for vulnerable groups of CHIV as new ARV options become\navailable.\n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nOur study identified major DR in most CHIV with VF. The last published\ncomprehensive DR surveillance for children in Kenya was in 2013 before\nthe changes to the recommend PI-containing ART for children less than\nthree years of age came into effect \\[ 17 \\]. Over 90% of the children\nin this national assessment were prescribed an NNRTI-containing regimen\ncompared to less than 50% in our contemporary cohort. However, a\nsimilarly high proportion of CHIV with treatment failure were found to\nhave any DR (89%) in the national survey. More recent surveillance\nstudies carried out in children in Lesotho, Uganda, and Zambia\ndemonstrate high rates of NRTI (50--80%) and NNRTI (84--97%) resistance\nand low rates of PI resistance (4--6%) in children with VF. Related\nadult HIV DR surveillance studies carried out in eight African countries\nbetween 2015 and 2019 also show high rates of NRTI and NNRTI DR among\nthose with VF on an NNRTI-containing regimen. The low rates of PI\nresistance in children with VF show that despite the transition to\nPI-containing regimens for a significant proportion of children, PI\nmedications (specifically lopinavir/ritonavir among our cohort)\nmaintained a high barrier to resistance. However, PI-containing regimens\nremain less attractive than alternatives; adult surveillance studies and\none study in children from Zambia consistently identify lower viral\nsuppression among people on PI-containing regimens compared to INSTI- or\nNNTRI-containing regimens, likely due to non-adherence \\[ 6 \\].\nAdditionally, the need to dose twice daily and the side effect profile\nof lopinavir/ritonavir support the transition away from this PI drug in\nchildren when other options are available.\n\nDeveloping strategies to optimize cost-effective use for targeted DRT\namong CHIV with VF is key to achieving higher rates of viral suppression\nin CHIV. A prior history of VF was a strong predictor of major DR. This\nfinding is important, as the guidelines in many countries do not take\nthis into account in their algorithms to guide the management of\nchildren with VF. Studies in both adults and children have demonstrated\nthe accumulation of new drug resistance with continued virologic failure\n\\[ 8 , 29 \\]. Additionally, children on ART for less than 2 years with\nVF had higher odds of major DR compared to CHIV on ART for longer\nperiods. It is possible that children on ART for shorter periods were\nyounger children who received antiretroviral prophylaxis during\nbreastfeeding selecting for pretreatment DR \\[ 7 \\]. Pre-treatment DR is\na growing concern noted by the WHO and others, and NNRTI resistance has\nincreased to a pooled estimate of 46% in infants, whereas it is less\nthan 15% in newly initiating adults \\[ 6 \\]. We had very few children\nnewly initiating ART and so were unable to estimate pre-treatment DR in\nthis cohort.\n\nOur findings support the broader use of DRT in CHIV, which is lacking in\nmany settings \\[ 30 \\]. While many HIV providers in low- and\nmiddle-income countries (LMICs) lack experience interpreting DRT, our\nmultidisciplinary virtual approach to case reviews was feasible and\nhighly acceptable. Given that nearly 60% of the children with prior VF\nin the last two years demonstrated major DR in our study, guidelines\nshould consider if DRT should be utilized sooner in children with\npersistent VF since adherence interventions alone may be insufficient.\nDRT may also allow for the preservation of NRTIs in children with VF,\nwhich is important given the limited ARV options for CHIV and the\npotential side effects of less preferred NRTIs such as zidovudine. Even\nwhen major DR is not identified by DRT, these findings can inform clinic\nstaff of the need to re-focus on the psychosocial and structural factors\ncontributing to non-adherence.\n\nThe rapid transition to DTG-containing regimens in children provides\nhope for improved VS in all CHIV, including for those with VF. Our\nfindings showed high viral resuppression in a small number of children\nwith VF who were switched to a DTG-containing regimen. How DRT should be\nused in the setting of wide-spread DTG use in children remains\nuncertain. NRTI mutations were highly prevalent in the CHIV with VF in\nthis cohort, which is similar to other reports in children \\[ 6 \\]. Over\nhalf of the children in our cohort were resistant to abacavir and\nlamivudine and over 10% were resistant to tenofovir. This is concerning\ngiven that these drugs are part of the current first-line regimens\nco-formulated with DTG for CHIV in Kenya and other LMICs. While some\nadult studies show that DTG-containing regimens may remain suppressive\neven in the setting of NRTI DR, this remains to be demonstrated in CHIV\n\\[ 31 , 32 \\]. Kenya's current treatment guidelines recommend switching\nto PI-containing regimens for children who fail on DTG, but as noted in\nour study and others, those on PI-containing regimens as a second line\nwere less likely to resuppress \\[ 6 \\]. Kenya has incorporated\nrecommendations for DRT in CHIV who experience VF on DTG, but subsequent\nregimen sequencing is uncertain, especially in light of frequent NRTI\nDR. Our results also show a concerningly high level of DR to rilpvirine,\nthreatening the use of the highly anticipated long-acting injectable\ncabotegravir/rilpivirine for CHIV. Similar results in adults in South\nAfrica and other settings have prompted investigators to suggest that\nDRT may be required before long-acting injectable ART can be used in\nLMICs \\[ 33 , 34 \\]. Thus, there is likely an important role for\ntargeted DRT in determining how best to manage CHIV with VF while on\nDTG.\n\nThe limitations of this study include the inability to determine\npre-treatment DR due to the fact that there were few children who were\ninitiating ART in this cohort and the lack of data on maternal ART and\nDR history, which is likely to correlate with DR identified in\nparticipants. Additionally, our study utilized DRT laboratories in Kenya\nto optimize the generalizability of DRT use in CHIV, but INSTI DR\ntesting was limited during the study period. While we observed a rapid\ntransition to DTG-containing regimens, we were not able to perform INSTI\nDR on CHIV with VF on DTG. We plan to use stored samples to further\nexplore these issues.\n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions\n\nThe findings from this study demonstrated high levels of major DR in\nchildren living with VF. Providers and policy makers should consider the\nidentified factors associated with major DR when considering which\nchildren may benefit most from DRT while it remains a limited resource.\nFurther research is needed to understand how DRT may be optimally used\namong children who are now mostly using DTG-containing regimens.\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThis research was funded by the National Institutes of Mental Health of\nthe U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH, R34MH115769) and the\nThrasher Research Fund (TRF15240).

Ninety-seven HIV-1-infected children who started two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) (mainly zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine) in Mali were prospectively studied. Following national and WHO recommendations at the time of the study, the first-line regimen for children of all ages was an association of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI): zidovudine or stavudine plus lamivudine plus nevirapine or efavirenz.\nRationale: The paper mentions that all naïve children were initiated a combination of two NRTIs and one NNRTI between 2006 and 2007. 97 HIV-1 infected children started two NRTI and NNRTI in Mali were studied.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 26196688\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: \"The majority of the children (64.6%) were initiated on a combination of d4T, lamivudine (3TC) and LPV/r, while the second most common regimen was d4T, 3TC and RTV-sPI (24.6%).

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals. This retrospective study examines genetic sequences and clinical parameters like CD4+ T cell counts and viral load to understand the epidemiological and genetic characteristics of HIV-1 in the pediatric population in Rio de Janeiro.\nAnswer: No"}

However, ART adherence remains a major challenge in\nHIV/AIDS treatment success. This systematic review and meta-analysis was\naimed to synthesize available evidence on adherence to ART among\nHIV/AIDS patients in Ghana.This review followed the preferred reporting\nitem for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) criteria. A\ncomprehensive literature search was done using five online databases\n(PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline, Africa Index Medicus, and Willey\nOnline Library) from 25th- 30th April 2023 to identify potential\nstudies. In addition, references of related articles were manually\nsearched to further identify relevant studies. Search records were\nmanaged in Endnote library where duplicates were removed prior to\nscreening. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were conducted in\nGhana, designed as an observational or experimental study, and\nexplicitly measured adherence to ART, either as a primary or secondary\noutcome. Studies were excluded if the proportion or prevalence of\nadherence to ART was not reported.A total number of 126 potential\nstudies were identified from the literature search. Of these, 14 met the\ninclusion criteria and were included in the Meta-analysis. The studies\ninvolved a total number of 4,436 participants. The pooled estimate of\nadherence to ART was 70% (CI: 58--81%). In subgroup analysis,\nadolescents and young adults had a lower adherence rate (66%, CI:\n46--84%) compared with adults (70%; CI: 58--81%). Publication bias was\nnot observed among studies. The pooled estimate of optimal adherence to\nART among HIV patients in Ghana was lower than is recommended (≥95%) to\nachieve viral suppression. Adherence was lower among young persons\nliving with HIV/AIDS. To achieve the United Nation's Sustainable\ndevelopment goals and the UNAIDS \"95-95-95\" targets, there is a need to\nfocus on improving adherence interventions among persons living with\nHIV/AIDS, especially among the younger cohort.\n\n\n## Methods\n\n### Ethics statement\n\nThe study required no ethical approval.\n\n### Search strategy\n\nThis review was registered in PROSPERO (Reg ID: CRD42023417543), and\nconducted following the preferred reporting item for systematic review\nand Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines \\[ 32 \\]. A protocol for this\nreview was prepared prior to the manuscript development. An extensive\nliterature search was performed in Medline, PubMed, Africa Index Medicus\n(AIM), Google Scholar, and Wiley Online Library. We searched for\npublished papers using the combination of free texts and medical subject\nheadings (MeSH) terms, e.g. \"Adherence\" \"non-adherence\" \"Compliance\"\n\"non-compliance\" \"ART\" \"HAART\" \"Highly active\" \"Antiretroviral therapy\"\n\"HIV/AIDS\" and \"Ghana\". We used the PICO framework for systematic\nreviews to structure the search using Boolean operator combinations.\nSupplemental searches were carried out by reviewing the references of\nthe included papers, as well as follow-up searches of citations to\nidentify additional papers that reported on medication adherence in\nGhana but which were not identified through the electronic database\nsearches. All searches were conducted from April 25 to 30, 2023.\n\n### Eligibility criteria and selection criteria\n\nStudies were included if (1) they were conducted in Ghana (2) used\nobservational or experimental designs that explicitly measured adherence\nto ART, either as a primary or secondary outcome; For experimental\nstudies, baseline adherence was considered; (3) mixed method studies\nthat reported on the prevalence of adherence were also included.\nConsistent with a similar review \\[ 33 \\], where more than one method\nwas used to measure adherence, the more objective method used was\nreported. To give a wider scope of studies included, we did not limit\nthe year of publication nor the age of study participants; we included\npublished dissertations that met the inclusion criteria. Studies were\nexcluded if they did not indicate evidence of prevalence of adherence to\nART or did not meet the inclusion criteria 1, 2, and 3 described above.\n\nAll citations of identified documents were imported into EndNote 13\nreference manager \\[ 34 \\] and screened for relevance. Screening was\ncarried out at three levels: title, abstract, and full text. At title\nand abstract levels, three reviewers (IB, MA, and KKA) independently\napplied a predetermined inclusion criteria to screen all titles and\nabstracts of the identified studies after duplicates were removed. Full\ntexts of the potentially eligible abstracts were downloaded, read, and\nsubsequently screened to ascertain their relevance with respect to the\ninclusion criteria. To eliminate any selection bias, a second reviewer\n(EA) screened 10% each of the included and excluded abstract and full\ntexts. Any discrepancies were addressed between reviewers. The PRISMA\nflow chart ( Fig 1 ) provides a summary description of the screening and\nselection process.\n\nFig 1\n\n**Flow chart showing study selection process \\[ 35 \\].**\n\nFor more information, visit: http://www.prisma-statement.org/.\n\n### Data extraction\n\nBoth text and statistical data were extracted from each of the articles\nmeeting the inclusion criteria by two reviewers (IB and KKA). A third\nreviewer (MA) cross-checked the extraction for quality. Key information\nextracted included author detail, year of publication, study setting,\nstudy design, sample size, sampling method, the method used to measure\nadherence and proportion of adherence to ART. The authors of two studies\n\\[ 28 , 36 \\] were contacted for additional relevant information we\nmissed during the data extraction process.\n\n### Quality assessment\n\nQuality assessment of the included studies was done using the revised\nJoanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal tools for systematic\nreviews \\[ 37 \\]. This appraisal tool assesses the methodological\nquality of a study and determines the extent to which the study has\naddressed the possibility of bias in its design, data collection, and\nanalysis \\[ 37 \\]. Two authors (KKA and IB) carried out the quality\nassessment independently and graded the studies as low (\\>70%), medium\n(50--70%), and high (\\<50%) \\[ 37 , 38 \\]. Discrepancies in the\nassessment and scoring were resolved through discussion and consensus.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nThe extracted data were imported into R statistical software for\nanalysis. Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation and inverse\nvariance methods were used to calculate the pooled estimates of\nadherence to ART. The weighted random effects model was considered\nrather than the common effects due to the large statistical\nheterogeneity across studies \\[ 39 -- 41 \\]. As asserted by Fletcher \\[\n41 \\], significant large heterogeneity can be handled in two ways;\nnarrative synthesis or meta-analysis using random effects. The latter\nwas used consistent with earlier studies \\[ 42 , 43 \\] as included\nstudies essentially measured the same outcome, that is, adherence to\nART.\n\nDocuments were categorized by research participant's age group:\n'adolescents and young adults' (10--24 years) versus 'adults' (18+).\nThis classification was based on WHO's classification of young people \\[\n44 \\]. Where there is age overlap, we used the reported mean to classify\na study under these categories. Thus, when the reported mean age is\ngreater than 24 years, the study was classified as an adult study or\notherwise. We used the Chi ^2^ Q test and I ^2^ statistic to identify\nheterogeneity; an I ^2^ estimate greater than 50% indicated significant\nheterogeneity \\[ 45 \\]. Potential sources of heterogeneity were assessed\nusing sensitivity and subgroup analyses. We performed exploratory\nanalyses of heterogeneity using meta-regression based on the sample size\nof the studies and the quality scores of individual studies. Potential\npublication bias was evaluated using Egger's and Begg's tests. The R\nsoftware package ' *metafor'* was used to perform the analysis. All\nstatistical analyses were 2-sided and statistical significance was\nconsidered at p-value \\< 0.05.\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Search outcome and study characteristics\n\nA total of 126 records were retrieved from the databases and\nsupplementary searches. Of these, 49 duplicates were identified and\nremoved. We excluded 56 records after screening titles and abstracts.\nTwenty-one full-texts were assessed for eligibility, and 14 met our\ninclusion criteria and were subjected to review. These 14 studies were\nconducted between 2013 and 2022. The PRISMA flowchart shows the document\nselection process \\[ Fig 1 \\].\n\nShown in Table 1 are the characteristics of the 14 studies included in\nthe meta-analyses. A total of 4,436 HIV-positive patients were studied\nacross the 14 studies to ascertain their adherence to ART with sample\nsizes ranging from 25 \\[ 36 \\] to 683 \\[ 30 \\]. Diverse measurement\nmethods were used to assess adherence to ART. These included studies\nthat used self-reported questionnaires \\[ 24 -- 26 , 28 , 30 , 46 -- 48\n\\], pill count \\[ 31 , 36 \\], Patient Attendance-based Defaulting (PAD)\n\\[ 49 \\], and a combination of other methods \\[ 27 , 50 \\] to determine\nadherence. Study designs used include surveys \\[ 23 -- 26 , 28 , 30 , 31\n, 36 , 47 -- 49 \\], randomized control trials \\[ 27 , 50 \\], and a\nprospective cohort \\[ 46 \\]. The studies were predominantly conducted in\nhealth facilities in the Ashanti (4/14; 28.6%) \\[ 24 , 25 , 46 , 49 \\]\nand Greater Accra (4/14; 28.6%) \\[ 23 , 26 , 36 , 50 \\] regions of\nGhana. Other regions included Central \\[ 47 \\], Eastern \\[ 31 \\], Upper\nWest \\[ 28 \\]; a few were conducted in multiple regions \\[ 27 , 30 , 48\n\\]. Of the 14 studies, 10 (71.4%) were conducted among adults while 4\n(28.6%) were among adolescents and young adults.\n\n### Adherence to antiretroviral therapy\n\nThe prevalence of adherence among the study participants ranged from 43%\n(95% CI; 36.0--50.0%) to 98% (95% CI; 96%-99.0%). The pooled estimate of\nadherence to ART was 70% (95% CI: 58.0--81.0) using a weighted-random\neffects model with significant heterogeneity ( *I* ^2^ = 99%, p\\< 0.001)\n**\\[ Fig 2 \\].** This obvious heterogeneity was further supported by the\ndrapery plot \\[ 51 \\] for all the studies in the meta-analysis \\[ **S1\nFig** \\]. In the drapery plot, the prediction region (light grey) is\nbroader than the p-value curve of the pooled estimates, showing\nsignificant heterogeneity **\\[ S1 Fig** \\].\n\nFig 2\n\n**Forest plot of the pooled estimate of ART adherence among HIV/AIDS\npatients in Ghana.**\n\n### Sensitivity analysis\n\nSensitivity analysis was carried out to identify studies that\ncontributed substantially to the pooled estimate and add to the overall\nheterogeneity of the meta-analysis. The baujat plot in **S2A Fig** shows\nthat five studies---in the following order: Dzansi \\[ 50 \\], Adam et al.\n\\[ 48 \\] Nichols et al. \\[ 27 \\] Addo et al. \\[ 23 \\] and Boateng and\nKumah \\[ 8 \\] have a large impact on the pooled estimates and add\nconsiderably to the heterogeneity. Further sensitivity analysis was\nperformed by omitting one study each at a time. As shown in **S2B Fig**\n, heterogeneity measured by *I* ^2^ is ranked from low to high. The plot\nshows that omitting the study by Dzansi \\[ 50 \\] and Adam et al. \\[ 48\n\\] resulted in *I* ^2^ value of 98%. The weighted pooled adherence rate\nand heterogeneity *I* ^2^ reduced after these five studies were excluded\nfrom the meta-analysis, falling to 69% (95% CI: 58.6--78.0) and 94% (p\n\\< 0.01), respectively.\n\n### Subgroup analysis of the prevalence of adherence to ART among HIV patients\n\nSubgroup analyses were performed with respect to the age of study\nparticipants (adolescents and young adults, versus adults) to determine\nthe prevalence of adherence rate. Findings showed that adolescents and\nyoung adults had the lowest adherence rate compared to adults \\[66% (95%\nCI: 46.0--84.0) vs. 71% (95% CI: 58.0--84.0), p = 0.66\\] \\[ ** Fig 3 **\n\\]. Results of the meta-regression showed estimated regression weights\nfor sample size and quality scores to be -0.0001 (p = 0.90) and -0.011\n(p = 0.81), respectively. This means that for every unit increase in\nsample size and quality score, the pooled adherence of the studies is\nexpected to decrease by 0.0001 and 0.011 respectively. The test of\nmoderators for sample size (QM = 0.02; p = 0.90) and quality scores (QM\n= 0.06, p = 0.81) had no effect on adherence **( S3 Fig )** . This\nimplies that neither sample size nor quality score could significantly\npredict the observed adherence estimate in the study.\n\nFig 3\n\n**Forest plot showing age subgroup analysis of the prevalence of\nadherence to ART among HIV/AIDS patients in Ghana.**\n\nThe horizontal line represents 95% CI, and the diamonds correspond to\nthe pooled estimate and CI. We used the random effect model.\n\n### Quality of included studies\n\nThe mean quality score of the studies was 6.7 out of a maximum score of\n8. The lowest and highest score was three and eight respectively. Of the\nstudies that were included in the review; 11 \\[ 23 -- 28 , 31 , 36 , 47\n, 48 , 50 \\], 2 \\[ 30 , 49 \\], and 1 \\[ 46 \\] were found to have a low,\nmoderate, and high risk of bias respectively. Half of the studies, (50%)\n\\[ 23 , 27 , 28 , 30 , 46 -- 48 \\] scored \"No\" on question related to\nwhether the outcome was measured in valid and reliable way. Three of the\nstudies \\[ 25 , 46 , 49 \\] did not clearly state criteria of inclusion\nof participants and were conducted in the Ashanti region with two\nemploying convenience sampling \\[ 46 , 49 \\] and the other random\nsampling \\[ 25 \\].\n\n### Publication bias\n\nThe Begg and Egger funnel plot for prevalence of ART adherence showed a\nskewed pattern, with several studies at the top of the funnel plot,\nindicating the presence of studies with large sample sizes **\\[ Fig 4 **\n\\]. There was no publication bias as Egger's test did not indicate the\npresence of funnel plot asymmetry (p = 0.86).\n\nFig 4\n\n**Assessment of publication bias.**\n\nBegg's funnel plot with a 95% confidence interval for adherence to ART.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nAdherence to medication remains a cornerstone to achieving better health\noutcomes among chronic diseases such as HIV/AIDS. Findings from this\nmeta-analysis have shown a pooled adherence rate of 70% among HIV/AIDS\npatients in Ghana. This pooled adherence estimate is far below the\nrecommended ≥95% required to achieve viral suppression \\[ 52 -- 54 \\].\nThis means critical attention and interventions are needed to prevent a\nhigher likelihood of ART drug resistance, new transmissions,\nhospitalization, morbidity, and mortality among this population.\n\nOur finding of 70% adherence rate is similar to the average adherence\nscore of 72.9% reported by Heestermans et al. \\[ 55 \\] in their review\nstudy in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the 70% adherence level in this\nstudy is slightly lower than the results reported by Mills et al. \\[ 21\n\\] in their review of published studies in Africa. Those authors\nreported a slightly higher adherence rate of 77% (95% CI, 68%-85%; I ^2^\n, 98.4%) among HIV/AIDS patients taking ART in Africa. The findings of\n70% adherence level is also far lower than the adherence estimate of\n93.7% among HIV/AIDS children in Ethiopia \\[ 22 \\]. The difference in\nthese adherence rates could be due to the different methods used to\nassess adherence and the different populations studied. For instance,\nthe study in Ethiopia focused on children less than 15 years whereas our\nstudy involved adolescents and the adult population \\[ 22 \\]. These\ndifferent population groups are likely to exhibit different medication\nadherence behaviors. The higher adherence rate in children could be due\nto the fact their parents provide support to adhere to their medication\nplan. Reporting bias and caregivers' overestimation of self-reports \\[\n56 , 57 \\] of adherence studies among children could lead to higher\nlevels of adherence. Meeting the UN Sustainable development goal 3 of\n\"ensuring good health for all at all ages\" implies a needed focus on\nstrategies and interventions for better health outcomes among HIV\npatients on anti-retroviral therapy.\n\nIn our sub-group analyses, adolescents and young adults had a lower\nadherence rate (66%) compared with adults (71%). This is similar to the\nstudies by Kim et al. \\[ 58 \\] where 62% of adolescents were reported to\nbe adherent to ART. Several barriers have been identified related to ARV\nintake among young people living with HIV. Adolescents and youth often\ndeny their HIV status, do not disclose their HIV status, and have the\nfalse perception that they feel better, leading to a lower perceived\nneed for taking their medication \\[ 59 -- 61 \\]. They also feel\nstigmatized coming to the clinic for medication; this leads to frequent\ninterruptions in adherence \\[ 62 -- 64 \\].\n\nA common barrier to adherence to ART reported was forgetfulness.\nForgetfulness is a well-documented barrier to adherence to ART \\[ 65 --\n68 \\] and several interventions including daily reminder messages have\nbeen implemented to address this barrier \\[ 69 -- 72 \\].\n\nThis study has both strengths and limitations. In terms of strengths,\nthis is the first comprehensive review that has focused on the\nprevalence of adherence to ART among HIV patients in Ghana. A systematic\nsearch of the literature using strict inclusion criteria was conducted\nto ensure wider coverage and depth of the evidence that is available\nabout ART adherence in Ghana. Furthermore, the methodological quality\nand strength of the evidence were critically appraised using tools\nrecommended for critical appraisal of the literature. This makes our\nfindings reliable and critical for use by policymakers to inform\ndecisions. However, we acknowledge some limitations of the review. Of\nthe 14 studies included in the review, two were not peer reviewed and\nthis may raise concern about the quality of evidence produced as well as\nthe credibility of the study outcomes reported. Furthermore, although we\nused a random effect model to account for the observed large\nheterogeneity from our meta-analysis, we could not significantly\nidentify the potential source of the large heterogeneity in our\nmeta-regression as only a few covariates were used. For example,\ncovariates such as gender which has been reported to significantly\nexplain the variation of adherence in similar studies \\[ 33 \\] were not\nincluded in our data. Gender-specific information on adherence to ART\nwas not reported in most of the included studies.\n\nIn resource-limited settings such as Ghana, self-report assessment of\nadherence is popular and widely used due to its ease of use in busy\nsettings, affordability, and low staff requirements \\[ 73 -- 75 \\]. Over\n60% of the included studies used self-report as opposed to objective\nmeasurements such as medication event monitoring system (MEMS), drug\nlevels, or viral load outcomes to assess adherence. This method is\nsubject to social desirability bias \\[ 76 \\] and has been reported to\noverestimate adherence \\[ 74 \\] and may affect the pooled adherence rate\ndocumented in this study. Notwithstanding these limitations, the\nfindings of this meta-analysis can guide the research potential of\nstrategic interventions to improve adherence to ART among PLHIV.\n\n### Implications of findings\n\nFindings from our review could be used by the Ghana National AIDS/STI\nControl programme (NACP) and the Ghana Health Service (GHS) to optimize\nART clinical services and adherence support within the current\nhealthcare systems. The sup-optimal ART adherence rate in this study\nimplies a need for attention to design and implement integrated\ninterventions (patient-friendly services, peer support, home visits,\ncommunity support) and strategies to achieve viral suppression. The\nimplementation of the interventions will also be important to reduce\ndrug resistance, reduce new infections and reduce HIV-related morbidity\nand mortality among PLHIV, especially among adolescents and young adults\nwho have increased risk of treatment failure due to sub-optimal\nadherence to ART. Healthcare professionals need to strengthen their\ncapacity for counseling services during regular follow-up visits by\nPLHIV. There is also the need for implementation research that targets\nthe several domains of the barriers to adherence to ART.\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA pooled adherence estimate of 70% was found among persons living with\nHIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy. Adherence was lower among young\npeople compared with adults. A comprehensive approach in the form of a\nmulti-component intervention in the domain of education, peer support,\nhome visit, and daily reminder messages will be necessary to address the\nmulti-dimensional complexities of adhering to ART for better treatment\noutcomes.\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThe authors received no specific funding for this work.\n\n\n\n## Data Availability\n\nData publicly available for purposes of replicability at figshare (DOI:\n10.6084/m9.figshare.24226444 ) and Dryad (DOI: 10.5061/dryad.gtht76hss\n).\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 20666602\nQuestion ID: 6\nQuestion: From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?\nEvidence: Viral sequences spanning the full protease and the first 400 amino acids of the RT from 3 different studies were pooled for this analysis: 351 sequences from the ACTG 320 trial ( http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/clinicalStudyData/ACTG320.html ) [ 21 , 22 ], 1188 sequences from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) (GenBank accession nos. of sequences used for the present study: GQ848100-GQ848156) [ 23 , 24 ], and 11 sequences from a lamivudine monotherapy trial (GenBank accession nos.

Among them, the MiSeq platform adopts\ndouble-end sequencing for sequencing viral and bacterial genomes, which\ncan achieve higher detection sensitivity and specificity, ^\\[\\ 4\\ \\]^\nand is more suitable for clinical implementation.\n\nTherefore, in response to previous studies showing inconclusive effects\nof pre-existing low-frequency resistance mutations on antiretroviral\nefficacy in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-infected patients,\nthe study was designed to detect pre-existing low-frequency resistance\nmutations in HIV-1-infected patients using the MiSeq second-generation\nsequencing platform to investigate their impact on virological response\nin HIV-1 naïve patients.\n\nHIV-1 ART-naïve patients attending the Second Hospital of Nanjing during\nJanuary 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020, with drug-sensitive results from\ntraditional pre-existing drug resistance test, were enrolled in this\nstudy. They received ART and were followed up for 12 months, with viral\nload monitoring at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months\nof treatment. All patients provided written informed consent, and the\nstudy was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Second\nHospital of Nanjing (No. 2018-LY-kt027). The study was conducted in\naccordance with the *Declaration of Helsinki* .\n\nFailure of virological response is defined as (1) HIV-1 RNA \\>200\ncopies/mL at 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment without any change in\ntreatment regimen; (2) patients who changed drugs within 6 months of\ntreatment because of high viral loads or slow decline in viral loads;\nand (3) patients with drug resistance detected after treatment.\nDefinition of successful virological response: viral load of HIV-1 RNA\n\\<50 copies/mL at 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment. Exclusion criteria\nwere: (1) Patients with poor adherence resulting in failure of\nvirological response, but after correcting the adherence of the viral\nload significantly reduced; (2) treatment of 6, 9, and 12 months of the\nviral load test data is missing to determine the results of virological\nresponse; (3) treatment of 12 months due to allergies, economic reasons,\nand simplified treatment of the second combination of self-selected drug\nchange.\n\nThirty-eight patients who failed antiviral therapy were defined as the\nfailure group according to the study definition criteria, and 38\nsuccessful virological responders were matched as the control group\nbased on the baseline characteristics of the failure group (baseline CD4\n^+^ T-lymphocyte counts and viral loads, 1:1 propensity score matching\nmethod, carboplatin value 0.05) \\[Supplementary Figure 1,\nhttp://links.lww.com/CM9/B780 \\].\n\nAll of the 76 HIV-1-infected patients with baseline plasma pre-existing\nlow-frequency drug resistance mutations were detected by the MiSeq\nsecond-generation sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).\n\nSPSS 26.0 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical\nanalysis. Count data were described by absolute numbers and rates.\nNon-parametric tests are used for data that do not conform to the normal\ndistribution to compare differences in patient CD4 ^+^ T-cell counts,\nHIV-1-RNA, and mutation detection rates between two groups. All tests\nwere two-sided and differences were considered statistically significant\nat *P* \\<0.05.\n\nA total of 76 patients enrolled in this study had been tested for\npre-existing resistance by conventional Sanger sequencing at baseline,\nwith results suggesting that no resistance mutations were detected. Of\nthe overall 76 included patients, CRF01-AE (40.8%, 31/76) was the\npredominant subtype, followed by subtypes B + C (26.3%, 20/76) and B\n(18.4%, 14/76). Both the control and failure groups were predominantly\nmale (92.1% \\[35/38\\] *vs* . 97.4% \\[37/38\\]), and the predominant\nsubtype was CRF01-AE (44.7% \\[17/38\\] *vs* .36.8% \\[14/38\\]). There was\nno significant difference in age, baseline CD4 ^+^ T-cell count, and\nbaseline HIV-1 RNA between the two groups ( *P* \\>0.05) \\[Supplementary\nTable 1, http://links.lww.com/CM9/B780 \\].\n\nAmong the 76 patients who underwent second-generation sequencing, the\nsuccess rate of amplification was 100%. Low-frequency resistance\nmutations were detected in a total of 18 loci, with a total number of 26\nmutations, and the mutations were predominantly in the NNRTI class of\nresistance, which accounted for 53.8% (14/26) of the mutated loci,\nincluding V179 (19.2%, 5/26), Y188 (7.7%, 2/26), and E138 (7.7%, 2/26).\nThe NRTI class resistance mutation rate was 38.5% (10/26), including K65\n(7.7%, 2/26) and D67 (7.7%, 2/26). In addition, one HIV-infected patient\nwith low-frequency resistance in the PI class and one with low-frequency\nresistance in the integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) class were\ndetected, respectively \\[Supplementary Figure 2,\nhttp://links.lww.com/CM9/B780 \\]. Two or more mutation sites were\npresent in 54.5% (6/11) of the patients.\n\nThe initial treatment regimen of patients in this study population was\npredominantly 2NRTI + NNRTI in 77.6% (59/76), while the remaining 17\npatients were on an INSTI-based antiviral regimen and all of them had at\nleast one viral load test result that could be used for determining the\nvirological response after 6 months of antiviral therapy. The results of\ntesting by second-generation sequencing showed that the overall\npre-existing low-frequency resistance detection rate of the included\npopulation was 14.5% (11/76), in which the pre-existing low-frequency\nresistance mutation rate of the failure group was significantly higher\nthan that of the control group (23.7% \\[9/38\\] *vs* . 5.3% \\[2/38\\]),\nand the difference was statistically significant ( *χ* ^2^ = 5.208, *P*\n= 0.022).\n\nThe study compared viral load levels at 48 weeks post-treatment in two\ngroups of patients with and without low-frequency resistance, with viral\nload data from patients who switched therapy after changing their\noriginal antiviral regimen no longer included in the analysis. The\nresults showed that there was no significant difference in viral load\nbetween the two groups at baseline, and after receiving antiviral\ntherapy it was seen that the viral load level of patients with\nlow-frequency resistance was consistently higher than that of patients\nwithout mutation, which showed no significant difference in viral load\nlevel between the two groups at 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 48 weeks ( *P* =\n0.126, 0.233, and 0.059), but at 24 weeks of treatment the difference in\nviral load level between the two groups was statistically significant (\n*P* = 0.010) \\[Supplementary Figure 3, http://links.lww.com/CM9/B780 \\].\n\nIn this retrospective study, the presence of HIV pre-existing\nlow-frequency resistance mutations was significantly higher in the\npost-ART virological failure group than in the successful virological\nresponse group, and resistance was predominantly to NNRTIs. A pooled\nanalysis evaluating the association between pre-existing low-frequency\nresistance mutations and the risk of first-line NNRTI antiretroviral.\nThe study showed that pre-existing low-frequency resistance mutations\nwere associated with an increased risk of virological failure after\ncontrolling for patient medication adherence, race, ethnicity, baseline\nCD4 ^+^ T-cell counts, and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, with low-frequency\nresistance mutations in the NNRTI class being the most strongly\nassociated with an increased risk of virological failure. ^\\[\\ 5--7\\ \\]^\nGiven that NNRTI-based ART regimens are still predominantly used by\nHIV-1-infected patients in many countries, it is important to speculate\non the possible presence of pre-existing low-frequency resistance\nmutations leading to resistance to NNRTIs after virological failure, and\ntimely switching to an INSTI- or protease inhibitor (PI)-based ART\nregimen is likely to result in a return to a successful virological\nresponse.\n\nWe further analyzed the level of viral load changes in patients\nreceiving antiviral therapy for 48 weeks. Comparison of viral load\nlevels after 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, and 48 weeks of antiviral\ntherapy, excluding the effect of baseline characteristics of patients\nwith and without low-frequency resistance mutations, showed that\npatients with low-frequency resistance mutations only at 24 weeks of\ntherapy had significantly higher viral load levels than patients without\nresistance mutations. According to the guidelines for the diagnosis and\ntreatment of AIDS, ^\\[\\ 8\\ \\]^ the time point for determining whether\nantiretroviral treatment failure has occurred and the need for switching\ntreatment is precisely 24 weeks after initiating treatment. Thus,\nlow-frequency resistance mutations delayed the rate of viral load\ndecline after ART and showed a single significant difference at 24 weeks\nof treatment, but with longer antiviral treatment, such as at 48 weeks\nof ART, there was no significant difference in viral load decline\nbetween the two groups. This may be due to the fact that after 24 weeks\nof treatment, some patients had already chosen to switch treatment\nregimens based on viral load levels or resistance testing, resulting in\na smaller sample size.\n\nIn conclusion, we showed that HIV-1 patients may have pre-existing\nlow-frequency resistance mutations in both the failed and successful\nvirological response groups, and that the prevalence of pre-existing\nlow-frequency resistance was higher in the former than in the latter.\nThere are some limitations of this study. First, this study was a\nsingle-center study and included a small sample size of patients. In\naddition, low-frequency resistance mutations occurring at different\nfrequencies may not have a uniform impact on antiviral efficacy, and the\nfrequency aspect of low-frequency resistance mutations was not analyzed\nin depth in this study.\n\nIn conclusion, pre-existing low-frequency resistance mutations are\npresent at a higher rate in the HIV-1 primary treatment population with\nfailed virological response than in patients with successful virological\nresponse.\n\n\n\n## Funding\n\nThis work was supported by the 2020 Annual Medical Research Project of\nJiangsu Commission of Health (No. ZDA 2020014), and the Key Project\nsupported by Medical Science and Technology Development Foundation,\nNanjing Department of Health (Nos.

The generated pol amplicons were sequenced by next-generation sequencing.\nResults: We observed low-frequency DRMs (detected at <20% in 33/103 (32%) of the successfully sequenced individuals, of whom four also had mutations detected at >20%. K65R was the most common low-frequency DRM detected in 8 individuals. Eighty-two of the 103 individuals had follow-up viral load data while on cART. Twenty-seven of the 82 individuals harbored low-frequency DRMs. Only 12 of 82 individuals experienced VF. The following low-frequency DRMs were observed in four individuals experiencing VF: K65R, K103N, V108I, and Y188C. No statistically significant difference was observed in the prevalence of low-frequency DRMs between individuals experiencing VF (4/12) and those not experiencing VF (23/70) (P = .97). However, individuals with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors-associated low-frequency DRMs were 2.68 times more likely to experience VF (odds ratio, 2.68; 95% confidential interval, 0.4–13.9) compared with those without (P = .22).\nRationale: The paper focuses on the sequencing and detection of low-frequency drug resistance mutations in HIV-1 from patient samples.

Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon.\nRationale: The paper doest not mention in vitro drug susceptibility data or phenotypic data.

We present three cases of treatment-emergent resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in patients with suboptimal treatment adherence and assess whether the resistance-associated mutations were present before BIC/TAF/FTC initiation or emerged during therapy.\nMethods: We used genotypic drug resistance testing by Sanger sequencing to identify emergent resistance mutations in plasma viral load specimens collected after combination antiretroviral therapy initiation in all participants. Additionally, we performed ultra-deep sequencing by Illumina MiSeq on the earliest available plasma HIV-1 viral load specimen and on any available specimens closest in time to the initiation of BIC/TAF/FTC therapy to identify low-abundance resistance mutations present in the viral quasispecies.\nResults: All three participants developed NRTI resistance after prolonged exposure and incomplete adherence to BIC/TAF/FTC. The T69N, K70E, M184I, and/or T215I mutations identified in clinical samples at the time of virological failure were not present on deep sequencing of either baseline samples or samples collected before BIC/TAF/FTC initiation.\nRationale: The paper does not report in vitro drug susceptibility data. Instead, it focuses on clinical cases of treatment-emergent resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in HIV patients treated with bictegravir/tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (BIC/TAF/FTC). The methods involve genotypic drug resistance testing using Sanger sequencing and ultra-deep sequencing to identify resistance mutations in clinical samples collected after therapy initiation. The results discuss the emergence of NRTI resistance mutations due to suboptimal adherence to the regimen, contrasting the resistance observed during therapy with what was present in baseline or pre-treatment samples.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 36578581\nQuestion ID: 12\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\nEvidence: \"In 8 (4.6%) of the 174 patients with INSTI resistance, DTG was the only INSTI used in the treatment regimen. All patients with intermediate-level resistance to DTG had DRMs to NNRTI and NRTI, which were M184V and K103N in two of them. Four of 5 patients with DTG resistance had poor therapeutic adherence (as assessed by their physicians when the sample was sent for resistance testing) and in the fifth, the treatment regimen had been changed after renal failure.\"\nRationale: The paper discusses the presence of drug resistance mutations in patients with treatment, indicating that sequences were obtained from such individuals.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 29026792\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: Patients were referred who were on ART treatment above 12 months and immunologically suspicious of treatment failure. The mean age of the participants was calculated to be 32.21 yr and over half of the patients (n=16) were male and the mean time of HARRT use was 47.69 months.  Standard first-line regimen in Iran is comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI);  drug resistance mutations for the 3 classes of ART (NNRTI, NRTI, and PI) were observed and 4 samples showed resistance to all of them.\nRationale: The paper mentions the patients got standard treatment, and the evidence indicates the presence of mutations associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, suggesting that individuals in the study had received these drug classes prior to sample sequencing.\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI"}

According to previous\nstudies, people who are living with HIV (PLWH) that are on current ART\nhave shown a decrease in both the morbidity and mortality associated\nwith HIV infection, along with a decreased risk of transmitting the\nvirus to others. ^\\[\\ 2--5\\ \\]^ Integrase strand transfer inhibitors\n(INSTIs) are the most recent category of ART medications, exhibiting\nstrong potency, high barrier to resistance, minimal drug interactions,\nand excellent tolerability. ^\\[\\ 6\\ ,\\ 7\\ \\]^ In 2009, the Chinese Food\nand Drug Administration (CFDA) authorized raltegravir (RAL) for the\nfirst INSTI for the treatment of HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome\n(AIDS), followed by the approval of dolutegravir (DTG), elvitegravir\n(EVG), bictegravir (BIC), and cabotegravir (CAB) in 2015, 2018, 2019,\nand 2023, respectively. Since 2018, INSTI-based regimens have been\nsuggested as the preferred first-line ART following the Chinese National\nGuidelines for HIV/AIDS Diagnosis and Treatment. ^\\[\\ 8\\ \\]^ However,\nthe use of INSTIs is restricted in most regions of the Chinese mainland\nowing to their high cost. Therefore, \\>80% of PLWH in China receive free\ntenofovir/zidovudine + lamivudine + efavirenz under the National Free\nAntiretroviral Treatment Program (NFATP). ^\\[\\ 8\\ ,\\ 9\\ \\]^ Since the\nyear 2020, the cost of INSTIs such as EVG, DTG, and BIC has\nprogressively decreased and is currently covered by Chinese medical\ninsurance. Local health insurance in major cities could cover 50--90% of\nthe cost, providing a substantial reimbursement policy; consequently, an\nincreasing proportion of PLWH selected INSTI-based regimens. By the end\nof 2022, nearly half of the PLWH in Tianjin were on INSTI-containment\nregimens. There has been a notable rise in the use of INSTIs, leading to\nthe steady emergence of INSTI-related resistance mutations. Limited\ninvestigations in China indicated a relatively low level of INSTI\nresistance among antiretroviral-naïve PLWH in large cities, such as\nBeijing and Shenzhen. ^\\[\\ 10\\ ,\\ 11\\ \\]^ However, the prevalence of\nINSTI resistance among treatment-naïve individuals in Tianjin remains\nunknown. This study evaluated the prevalence of INSTI-associated drug\nresistance among ART-naïve individuals infected with HIV-1 in Tianjin,\nChina.\n\nThe current study recruited 629 ART-naïve individuals from Tianjin\nSecond People\\'s Hospital between January 1, 2020, and April 1, 2023.\nThe criteria for inclusion in the study were as follows: (1) outpatients\nat Tianjin Second People\\'s Hospital; (2) HIV-1 seropositive; (3) aged\n≥18 years; (4) no prior antiviral treatment; and (5) participants who\nprovided consent and could undergo drug resistance tests. Exclusion\ncriteria were as listed: pregnancy, breastfeeding women, incomplete\ndata, and refusal to give informed consent. Before initiating ART, 5 mL\nof blood was collected from the participants. Baseline clinical and\ndemographic data were obtained from the NFATP database, including sex,\nage, transmission route, CD4 count, and viral load. The study was\ncarried out in accordance with the *Declaration of Helsinki* and with\nthe approval of the Tianjin Second People\\'s Hospital\\'s Ethical\nCommittee (No. 2015-13). All subjects participating in the study\nprovided written informed consent.\n\nAfter RNA extraction, an in-house genotyping method and standard Sanger\nsequencing were used to amplify and sequence HIV-1 integrase genes, as\ndescribed previously. ^\\[\\ 10\\ \\]^ HIV-1 subtypes were determined using\nthe REGA HIV-1 Subtyping Tool (version 3.0,\nhttps://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/hiv ). We used the\nStanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database (HIVDB Algorithm\nversion 9.4.1) to examine mutations. Sequences with resistance levels\nclassified as low, intermediate, and high were all regarded as\nresistant.\n\nStatistical analysis was carried out using SPSS (version 26, IBM,\nArmonk, NY, USA). Mean and standard deviation were used for expressing\nquantitative data with a normal distribution; median and interquartile\nrange (IQR) were used to express quantitative data with an abnormal\ndistribution. The Fisher\\'s exact test was used to compare categorical\nvariables. All statistical analyses were two-tailed, with *P* \\<0.05\ndefining statistical significance.\n\nOf 629 newly reported cases, the HIV-1 integrase genes of 601 cases were\nsequenced successfully. The majority of study participants were male\n(93.0%, 559/601), the median age was 37 (IQR: 31--49) years, and sexual\ncontact was the main transmission route (66.2% \\[398/601\\] homosexual\nand 23.1% \\[139/601\\] heterosexual contacts). The baseline median viral\nload and CD4 count were 55,300 (IQR: 19,470--163,692) copies/mL and 417\n(IQR: 249--618) cells/μL, respectively. The most predominant HIV-1\nsubtype was circulating recombinant form (CRF)01_AE (54.1%, 325/601),\nfollowed by CRF07_BC (32.1%, 193/601), B (5.0%, 30/601), CRF55_01B\n(3.7%, 22/601), CRF01_AE/CRF07_BC (1.3%, 8/601), and others (3.8%,\n23/601) \\[Supplementary Table 1, http://links.lww.com/CM9/B781 \\].\n\nAmong the 601 cases, 14 (2.33%) cases harbored INSTI resistance\nmutations, with 2 (0.33%) harboring major mutations and 13 (2.16%) cases\nhaving accessory mutations. One sample had both major and accessory\nmutations \\[Table ​ \\[Table1\\]. 1 \\]. Three major mutations were\ndetected, namely, G140A, Y143H, and Q148R. G140A mutations were\nnon-polymorphic and generally occurred with Q148 mutations. G140A\nmutations alone had negligible effects on the susceptibility of INSTIs.\nNevertheless, the co-occurrence of G140A mutations with Q148 mutations\nwas shown to be linked with high resistance against EVG and RAL, and\nalso intermediately reduced susceptibility to BIC and DTG. ^\\[\\ 12\\ \\]^\nY143H mutations were associated with a high level of RAL resistance and\npotential low levels of CAB and EVG resistance, but they had no effect\non DTG or BIC resistance. ^\\[\\ 13\\ \\]^\n\nL74M/LIM was the most prevalent accessory mutation (8/14, 57.14%), but\nit had little effect on INSTI susceptibility. ^\\[\\ 12\\ \\]^ The other\naccessory mutations included E157Q (2/14, 14.29%), S153A (2/14, 14.29%),\nand D232N (1/14, 7.14%). S153A and D232N may not reduce INSTI\nsusceptibility, ^\\[\\ 14\\ \\]^ whereas E157Q may induce low-level EVG and\nRAL resistance. ^\\[\\ 15\\ \\]^\n\nTwo cases developed resistance to INSTIs, with both cases showing RAL\nresistance at a frequency of 0.33% and one case showing BIC (0.17%), CAB\n(0.17%), DTG (0.17%), and EVG (0.17%) resistance.\n\nThe following HIV-1 subtypes have been identified in the 14\nINSTI-resistant variants: CRF01_AE (8/14, 57.1%), CRF07_BC (4/14,\n28.6%), CRF68_01B (1/14, 7.1%), and CRF124_cpx (1/14, 7.1%). There were\nno statistical differences in INSTI resistance among HIV-1 subtypes.\n\nThis study revealed three major INSTI-resistant mutations, G140A, Y143H,\nand Q148R, and four accessory mutations, L74M/LIM, S153A, E157Q, and\nD232N, in 14 ART-naïve individuals. These mutations were associated with\ndifferent levels of resistance to the INSTIs. The frequency of INSTI\nresistance among ART-naïve individuals in Tianjin was 2.33%, which was\nslightly higher than that in Shenzhen (1.77%), Guangdong (1.49%), and\nBeijing (0.53%). ^\\[\\ 10\\ ,\\ 11\\ ,\\ 16\\ \\]^\n\nG140A along with Q148 mutation decreases RAL and EVG sensitivity by\n\\>100-fold, reduces CAB susceptibility by approximately 10-fold, and\nreduces DTG and BIC susceptibility by approximately 2-fold to 5-fold.\n^\\[\\ 17\\ \\]^ The rare mutation Y143H may be a transitional mutation\nbetween the 2-bp mutation R and wild-type Y, which decreases RAL\nsusceptibility by \\~3-fold to 20-fold. ^\\[\\ 12\\ \\]^ The accessory\nmutations identified in our study, namely, L74M/LIM, S153A, and D232N,\ndo not lower INSTI susceptibility on their own. E157Q was associated\nwith potential low-level of EVG and RAL resistance, but it had no\ninfluence on INSTI therapeutic response. ^\\[\\ 15\\ \\]^\n\nSince 2020, EVG, BIC, and DTG have been the most commonly used INSTIs\nfor ART in Tianjin, whereas RAL is used by an extremely small proportion\nof ART-treated patients. According to our findings, even though there\nare signs of resistance to INSTIs, the frequency of resistance to INSTIs\nremains lower than that to other antiretroviral drug classes,\n^\\[\\ 18\\ \\]^ indicating that INSTIs are the preferred treatment option\nin Tianjin. In our study, one sample exhibited high-level CAB\nresistance. CAB, which was recently approved by the CFDA as the first\nlong-acting drug, is possibly used more frequently for pre-exposure\nprophylaxis and treatment. Hence, when CAB becomes available in China in\nthe future, it is critical to be alert against the emergence of\nresistance.\n\nIn conclusion, Tianjin has a low prevalence of INSTI resistance,\nindicating that INSTIs are well-applicable. The selection of treatment\nregimens should be based on the specific pattern of regional drug\nresistance. Despite the low prevalence of major INSTI mutations, owing\nto the widespread use of first- and second-generation INSTIs, it is\ncritical to maintain cautious monitoring of INSTI drug resistance\nmutations.\n\n\n\n## Funding\n\nThis study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China (Nos. 82002136 and 82260658), the Health Science and\nTechnology Project of Tianjin Health Commission (Nos.

Recently, WHO has emphasized the need to fast-track the transition to dolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral (ARV) treatments. However, continued surveillance of INSTI resistance is recommended. In this study, clinical, epidemiological, and virological features associated with INSTI resistance diagnosed in Spain were analyzed. Samples collected between 2008 and 2021 from HIV-1-infected patients were analyzed in integrase, protease, and reverse transcriptase using Sanger population sequencing. ARV drug resistance was evaluated with the Stanford University HIVdb program. Among 2,696 patients, 174 (6.5%) had INSTI resistance, all of them to first-generation INSTIs, and 71 (2.6%) had also resistance to second-generation INSTIs. Of these, only 5 individuals were exposed to DTG as the only INSTI, in whom resistance development was associated with poor treatment adherence and/or resistance to other ARV classes. Of newly HIV-1-diagnosed individuals, 0.92% harbored INSTI-resistant viruses, with low prevalences maintained along time, and only one had low-level resistance to DTG. Persons who inject drugs, age over 39 years, resistance to other ARV classes, and longer time from diagnosis were associated with INSTI resistance (p < 0.001). Non-subtype B INSTI-resistant viruses lacked the Q148H + G140S resistance pathway and showed lower INSTI resistance levels than subtype B viruses. In conclusion, INSTI resistance is uncommon and associated with long-term infections, older age and additional resistance to other ARV drug classes, and is rare in newly diagnosed HIV-1 infections. Our results also support the preferential use of DTG-containing regimens in first-line treatments, although surveillance of INSTI resistance is encouraged.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the analysis of drug resistance mutations and their prevalence in patient samples, but it does not mention conducting in vitro drug susceptibility tests.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 35300056\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Methods: 865 ART-naive patients were enrolled in this study between January 2019 and June 2021 in Beijing.

HIV-1 subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) were determined using the COMET online tool (http://comet.retrovirology.lu). Stanford HIV-1 drug resistance database (HIVdb version 8.9) was used to analyze the mutations.\nResults: 865 HIV-1 pol sequences were successfully amplified and sequenced. Among them, no major INSTI-related mutations were identified, but 12 polymorphic accessory mutations were found.

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences.

We aimed to determine the impact of point‐of‐care (POC) VL and\ntargeted drug resistance mutation (DRM) testing in improving VS among\npregnant and postpartum women on antiretroviral therapy.\n\n### Methods\n\nWe conducted a pre/post‐intervention prospective cohort study among 820\npregnant women accessing HIV care at five public‐sector facilities in\nwestern Kenya from 2019 to 2022. The pre‐intervention or \"control\" group\nconsisted of standard‐of‐care (SOC) centralized VL testing every 6\nmonths and the post‐intervention or \"intervention\" group consisted of a\ncombined strategy of POC VL every 3 months, targeted DRM testing, and\nclinical management support. The primary outcome was VS (VL ≤1000\ncopies/ml) at 6 months postpartum; secondary outcomes included uptake\nand turnaround times for VL testing and sustained VS.\n\n### Results\n\nAt 6 months postpartum, 321/328 (98%) of participants in the\nintervention group and 339/347 (98%) in the control group achieved VS\n(aRR 1.00, 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\] 0.98, 1.02). When assessing VS\nusing a threshold of \\<40 copies/ml, VS proportions were lower overall\n(90−91%) but remained similar between groups. Among women with viraemia\n(VL\\>1000 copies/ml) who underwent successful DRM testing in the\nintervention group, all (46/46, 100%) had some DRMs and 20 (43%) had\nmajor DRMs (of which 80% were nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase\ninhibitor mutations). POC VL testing uptake was high (\\>89%) throughout\npregnancy, delivery, and postpartum periods, with a median turnaround\ntime of 1 day (IQR 1, 4) for POC VL in the intervention group and 7 days\n(IQR 5, 9) for SOC VL in the control group. Sustained VS throughout\nfollow‐up was similar between groups with either POC or SOC VL testing\n(90−91% for \\<1000 copies/ml, 62--70% for \\<40 copies/ml).\n\n### Conclusions\n\nOur combined strategy markedly decreased turnaround time but did not\nincrease VS rates, which were already very high, or sustained VS among\npregnant and postpartum women living with HIV. Further research on how\nbest to utilize POC VL and DRM testing is needed to optimize sustained\nVS among this population.\n\n\n## 2. METHODS\n\n### 2.1. Study design and procedures\n\nWe conducted an open‐label, pre/post‐intervention (or\nintervention/control) prospective cohort study, enrolling pregnant women\nliving with HIV during their ANC care and followed them through 6 months\npostpartum in five public‐sector HIV treatment facilities in Kenya from\nFebruary 2019 to November 2022 (Figure 1 ). The pre‐intervention cohort\nserved as the \"control\" group, receiving standard‐of‐care (SOC), which\nconsisted of centralized VL testing approximately every 6 months, from\nall five facilities. The post‐intervention cohort served as the\n\"intervention\" group, receiving a combined strategy of POC VL every 3\nmonths, targeted DRM testing, and clinical management support, also from\nall five facilities. HIV DRM testing was performed at the two accredited\ncentralized laboratories in Kenya using Sanger sequencing for\nparticipants in the intervention group with VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml.\nFollow‐up of the control cohort overlapped in calendar time with\nenrolment of the intervention cohort (control group enrolment started on\n26 February 2019 and follow‐up lasted until 22 April 2021; intervention\ngroup enrolment started on 7 October 2019 and follow‐up lasted until 31\nDecember 2021). We chose the study facilities to leverage existing POC\ntechnologies, specifically the GeneXpert platform, and for geographical\nreach for study staff based in Kisumu, Kenya. Details on study\nprocedures are found in Supplementary Text and Figure 1 .\n\nFigure 1\n\nFlow diagram of study participants in the Opt4Mamas study, February\n2019--December 2021.\n\n### 2.2. Study setting and population\n\nThe study was conducted in low‐resource, high‐HIV burden public sector\nfacilities in Kisumu County, western Kenya, with one of the highest\nprevalence of HIV infections in Kenya (Table S1 ). Comprehensive HIV\ncare and treatment services were provided per Kenyan ART guidelines by\nfacility staff, including ART for all persons diagnosed with HIV \\[ 10\n\\]. First‐line ART regimens among adults during the study period\nincluded combinations of two nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors (NRTIs) lamivudine and tenofovir with either (1) NNRTI\nefavirenz or (2) integrase inhibitors (INSTIs) dolutegravir, and\nprotease inhibitors (PIs)‐containing ART, for example with\natazanavir/ritonavir, were considered alternative first‐line or\nsecond‐line regimens; a wider transition for patients on\nnon‐dolutegravir first‐ or second‐line regimens to\ndolutegravir‐containing ART occurred in 2019 \\[ 10 \\].\n\n### 2.3. Study eligibility\n\nWe enrolled women presenting at ANC meeting the following inclusion\ncriteria: (1) adult (\\>17 years of age) pregnant female either already\nknown or newly diagnosed with HIV; (2) at 32 weeks or less of\ngestational age; (3) with first ANC visit; (4) planning to return to the\nsame facility for the remainder of her pregnancy and postpartum care;\nand (5) on ART or planning to initiate ART within 1 week. Women on third\nor salvage ART regimens (due to the higher complexity of managing\nviraemia \\[VL\\>1000 copies/ml\\] for such individuals) or receiving ANC\nor HIV care at another facility were excluded.\n\n### 2.4. Variables\n\nOur primary outcome was VS (defined as VL \\<1000 copies/ml, as per\ncountry guidelines) by POC VL testing at 6 months postpartum (defined as\n48 weeks +/− 16 weeks, a wide window intended to maximize our ability to\nobtain a VS measurement in spite of COVID interruptions). If a POC VL\ntest was not available at 6 months postpartum, any available SOC test in\nthe same window was used. Our secondary outcomes included VS defined by\nlower VL cutoffs and a set of process outcomes, such as uptake and\nturnaround time of VL testing results. We define major, minor, and\naccessory classifications for HIV drug resistance according to the\nStanford HIV Resistance Database \\[ 35 \\]. We define sustained VS (SVS)\nas having VS at all intervals through the 6‐month postpartum visit among\nparticipants with at least two study intervals tested and with the\nrespective VL testing modality for the group (i.e. POC VL for\nintervention or SOC VL for control group).\n\nThe primary exposure was control versus intervention group. Participant\nclinical and socio‐demographic information as well as household\ncharacteristics (e.g. household commodities and food insecurity) were\ncollected from all participants at enrolment. Other information, such as\npsychosocial and behavioural data (e.g. self‐reported adherence), were\ncollected at every study visit.\n\n### 2.5. Statistical analysis\n\nPower for the study was for comparing the proportion of women with VS 6\nmonths postpartum in the control versus intervention groups. Based on\nhistorical facility data, we expected approximately 75% VS in the\ncontrol group. We estimated that 270 women per group would provide 80%\npower to detect an increase of 10% post‐intervention VS (i.e. 75% vs.\n85%) using a chi‐squared test with α = 0.05. We aimed to screen 350\nwomen in each group to account for an anticipated 25% of available women\nnot enrolling, transferring out to other facilities, experiencing\npregnancy loss or lost to follow‐up at 6 months postpartum. In February\n2020, we generated additional power calculations given\nhigher‐than‐expected baseline VS. We estimated that with 410 women per\ngroup and 90.5% VS in the control group, we would have approximately 80%\npower to detect a 50% decrease in the proportion unsuppressed (i.e. 9.5%\nvs. 4.7% unsuppressed).\n\nWe compared descriptive statistics for participant baseline\ncharacteristics by group using chi‐squared tests for categorical and *t*\n‐tests for continuous variables. We describe VS by group at enrolment\n(any blood draw 0--90 days prior to enrolment), 3 and 6 months after\nenrolment, delivery, and 3 and 6 months postpartum (any blood draw +/− 6\nweeks within visit target except for the 3‐month visit which\nadditionally included blood draws from day after enrolment to 6 weeks\nafter the 3‐month visit). The primary analysis compared the observed\nproportion of women with VS at 6 months postpartum (primary outcome) in\nthe control versus intervention groups using a modified Poisson\nregression model with robust standard error estimation, adjusting for\nfacility, to obtain the adjusted relative risk (aRR) \\[ 36 \\]. An *a\npriori* sensitivity analysis defined VS as VL\\<40 copies/ml and *a post\nhoc* analysis as VL\\<400 copies/ml. Further *post hoc* sensitivity\nanalyses included: (a) adjusting for enrolment characteristics differing\n(α\\<0.05) by group, in case of confounding; and (b) using inverse\nprobability weighting, to address missing outcomes. We also conducted a\n*post hoc* secondary analysis evaluating the effect of the intervention\non SVS.\n\n\n\n## 3. RESULTS\n\n### 3.1. Enrolment characteristics\n\nA total of 1105 women were assessed for study eligibility, of which 285\n(26%) were excluded (Figure 1 ). Eight hundred and twenty women were\nenrolled, with 411 and 409 allocated to the intervention and control\ngroups, respectively. Retention to study visit at 6 months postpartum\nwas 88% and 92% and primary outcome ascertained for 80% and 85% of\nparticipants in the intervention and control groups, respectively, and\ntwo maternal deaths occurred unrelated to the study.\n\nMedian maternal age at enrolment was 29 years (interquartile range\n\\[IQR\\] 24, 33), gestational age was 19 weeks (IQR 13, 25), gravida was\n3 (IQR 2, 4), parity was 2 (IQR 1, 3), 423 (52%) had achieved a\nsecondary education and 696 (85%) were married (Table ​ (Table1). 1 ).\nThe median CD4 cell count was 523 (IQR 370, 708.5) and 628 (76.6%) were\nWHO Stage I or II. Overall, 622 (76%) participants were on NNRTI‐, 71\n(8.7%) on PI‐ and 80 (10%) on integrase‐containing ART at enrolment, and\nthe median time on ART was 4.0 years (IQR 1.2, 6.3). Among 771 (94%) of\nthe participants with a VL documented in the 24 months prior to\nenrolment, 672 (82%) had VS.\n\nMore women in the intervention group versus control group were on\nINSTI‐containing ART (17% vs. 2.4%, respectively, *p* \\<0.001) and\nreported no food insecurity (38% vs. 31%, respectively, *p* = 0.05).\nFacility characteristics, ART regimen changes, VS during the course of\nthe study and delivery outcomes can be found in Tables S1--S4 ,\nrespectively.\n\nThe proportion of women with VS at enrolment in the intervention group\nwas 343/379 (90%) by POC VL testing, and 256/269 (95%) in the control\ngroup by SOC VL testing (Table 2 ). Among those in the intervention\ngroup who also had SOC VL testing, VS was 152/157 (97%).\n\n### 3.2. Primary outcome of VS proportions\n\nAt 6 months postpartum, 321/328 (98%) of participants in the\nintervention group and 339/347 (98%) in the control group achieved VS by\nPOC VL testing (aRR 1.00, 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\] 0.98, 1.02;\nTable 2 ). When using a lower threshold of \\<400, results were almost\nidentical; using \\<40 copies/ml, the VS proportion at 6 months\npostpartum was lower than seen with the higher thresholds but still\nsimilar by group. Findings from the sensitivity analyses, adjusting for\ndiffering enrolment characteristics between the groups and inverse\nprobability weighting analysis, were similar (Table 2 ).\n\n### 3.3. DRM testing, resistance identified and ART change recommendations\n\nIn the intervention group, from enrolment up until 6 months postpartum,\nwe identified 54 episodes of VL\\>1000 copies/ml, among 48 (11.7%)\nparticipants (Table 3 ). In the intervention group, 52 DRM tests were\nrequested, of which 46 (88%) were successfully conducted (six samples\nfailed to amplify) and all identified at least one DRM (K103N \\[ *n* =\n12, 28%\\] and M184V \\[ *n* = 10, 22%\\] were most commonly detected\nmutations). Our Clinical Management Committee recommended that 6 (12%)\nof the 48 women undergo an ART change, of which all six (100%) had an\nART change documented by 6 months postpartum. In contrast, we recorded\n37 episodes of VL\\>1000 copies/ml, among 29 (7%) control participants\nwith no DRM tests requested in this group.\n\n\n### 3.4. Secondary outcomes of VL testing uptake, turnaround time and infant testing\n\nOf the participants attending each study visit in the intervention\ngroup, 100%, 51%, 43%, 90%, 75% and 94% had a POC VL conducted at 0, 3\nand 6 months after enrolment, delivery, 3 and 6 months postpartum,\nrespectively (Table 4 ); the 3‐ and 6‐month after enrolment visits were\nheavily impacted by COVID‐19‐related restrictions in 2020. Among\nparticipants in the control group, 66%, 27%, 15%, 0%, 38% and 42% had a\nSOC VL conducted at 0, 3 or 6 months after enrolment, delivery, and at 3\nand 6 months postpartum, respectively.\n\nOf the POC VL tests conducted in the intervention group during the\nentire study period, 90% were returned to the participant, and ≥ 60%\nwere returned within 24 hours of the blood draw (excluding the 6‐month\npostpartum visit in which only 31% were returned within 24 hours due to\ndisruptions in the global supply of POC VL cartridges for GeneXpert\nsystems; Table 4 ). Return of results to providers followed similar\npatterns. Neither the number of total VL test requests nor the\nturnaround time from sample collection to return of results to the women\nwas available in the control group. From sample collection to result\nreturn to providers, the median turnaround time was 1 day (IQR 1, 4) for\nPOC VL testing in the intervention group and 7 days (IQR 5, 9) for SOC\nVL testing in the control group.\n\nThrough the 6‐month postpartum visit, one and three infants tested HIV\npositive in the intervention and control groups, respectively (Table S5\n).\n\n### 3.5. Secondary outcome of sustained VS\n\nSVS was lower than VS point prevalence at 6 months postpartum but was\nstill similar by group; 311/352 (88.4%) in intervention group and\n332/366 (90.7%) in control group (aRR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93, 1.03) (Table 5\n). SVS measured at \\<400 copies/ml was 304/352 (86.4%) and 321/366\n(87.7%; aRR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91, 1.02) and at \\<40 copies/ml was 246/352\n(70.0%) and 226/366 (61.7%; aRR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89, 1.12) in the\nintervention and control groups, respectively.\n\n## 4. DISCUSSION\n\nIn this prospective, intervention/control cohort study among women\nliving with HIV on ART, we did not observe differences in VS between\nwomen receiving a combined intervention with POC with higher frequency\nVL testing every 3 months, targeted DRM testing, and clinical decision\nsupport, and control women, during pregnancy, delivery or the postpartum\nperiods. Overall, we observed \\>90% VS at 6 months postpartum in this\nstudy at thresholds of VL \\<1000, \\<400 and \\<40 copies/ml. However, a\nsizeable proportion of women experienced viraemia during pregnancy and\npostpartum periods when considering all VL checks (10−38%), and major\nDRMs among these women may be important. POC VL and DRM testing was\nhighly feasible in this setting, with rapid turnaround times, and\nresulted in a larger proportion of women undergoing these testing during\npregnancy and postpartum periods.\n\nWe did not observe any associations between our combined intervention\nand VS among pregnant and postpartum women. Our failure to demonstrate\nefficacy may be due to biased sampling of women better engaged in care,\ninability to implement POC VL testing with optimal fidelity, overall\nimprovements in VS among the women over time and/or the increased use of\ndolutegravir‐containing ART which is equally or more potent than\nefavirenz‐containing ART \\[ 37 − 39 \\]. Nonetheless, when considering\nSVS throughout the pregnancy and postpartum periods, a sizeable number\nof women lacked VS at some point during pregnancy, as low as 62% when\nusing the lowest VL threshold of \\<40 copies/ml. With maternal VL being\nthe greatest predictor of vertical transmission, achieving VS among\npregnant and postpartum women remains an enduring concern; vertical\ntransmission rates were around 2% among mothers with VLs ranging from 40\nto 1000 copies/ml \\[ 3 \\]. In our study, few vertical transmissions were\nrecorded and POC VL uptake was high. Efforts to eliminate vertical\ntransmission will require rapid identification and intervention for\npregnant and breastfeeding women with viraemia, and POC VL may still\nhave a targeted role in achieving the elimination of vertical\ntransmission.\n\nThe evidence base regarding the utility of POC VL testing in improving\nclinical outcomes is mixed. We saw no efficacy on VS in our parallel,\nrandomized controlled trial in children \\[ 22 \\]. A South African\nrandomized controlled trial compared 3‐monthly POC VL testing to\n6‐monthly SOC laboratory‐based VL testing among postpartum women living\nwith HIV on first‐line ART, and found no significant difference in VL\nsuppression rates \\[ 23 \\]. Similarly, a study among Nigerian adults\ninitiating ART reported that POC VL monitoring did not improve 12‐month\nVS, but it did improve retention and VS documentation and was favoured\nby the majority of patients and healthcare workers \\[ 24 \\]. Other\nstudies demonstrated some benefits to POC VL. A preliminary analysis\nsuggests significant improvement in VS (7%) among pregnant/breastfeeding\nUgandan women, children/adolescents (2--17 years), viraemic patients and\npatients overdue for VL who received POC VL \\[ 25 \\]. A study that\ncombined POC VL with a differentiated service delivery strategy resulted\nin enhanced VS by 10.3% and retention by 7.7% among South African adults\nliving with HIV \\[ 26 \\]. Ultimately, despite some studies showing no\nefficacy, enthusiasm for POC VL testing exists not only among patients\nand providers, but also among policymakers at the national and\ninternational levels \\[ 18 , 32 , 40 \\]. Future research needs to help\nelucidate cost‐effective ways for when best to use POC VL testing, among\nwhom and at what interval frequency.\n\nAmong women with viraemia in our study who underwent successful DRM\ntesting, all had some DRMs and 43% had major DRMs (with NNRTI K103N and\nNRTI M184V being the most common). A study conducted in Sierra Leone\nshowed K103N as the most frequent DRM, occurring in 20% of pregnant\nwomen, with M184V in 11% \\[ 41 \\]. Among Kenyan pregnant women, 65% of\nviraemic women showed some DRMs \\[ 42 \\]. Among women initiating ART,\nmost of whom reported prior exposure to antiretrovirals for prevention\nof vertical transmission, the prevalence of DRM to NNRTIs was 14.6% \\[\n28 \\]. INSTI resistance testing was unavailable in Kenya during the\nstudy period, and while greater than half of the women transitioned to\nINSTI‐containing regimens by the study end, we do not think the\ninclusion of INSTI resistance testing would have altered our overall\nfindings, as the emergence of dolutegravir resistance with short\nexposures is unlikely \\[ 43 \\]. However, the inclusion of INSTI\nresistance testing will become necessary as women become viraemic after\na longer duration on dolutegravir‐containing regimens. In the current\nstudy, around one in eight women with a DRM test result required ART\nchange; at a population level, this is a substantial number. Lack of\ndrug resistance may be equally valuable for clinicians as this indicates\nthat the regimen does not require a switch for resistance reasons and\nsuggests other causes for viraemia. From our clinical case reviews, it\nappears that many women with viraemia face larger, psychosocial and\nbehavioural challenges (manuscript forthcoming) which require additional\ninterventions in combination with information provided by DRM testing.\nThus, differentiated service delivery models need to be urgently\ndeveloped to concentrate the needed extra resources for those women\nstruggling with VS, including women on salvage regimens or not engage in\ncare (noting such women were excluded from our study), during this\ndynamic period of their pregnancy care.\n\n### 4.1. Limitations\n\nOurs is the first study to combine VL with DRM testing in optimizing VS\namong pregnant and postpartum women; however, it has limitations. First,\nOpt4Mamas could not be pursued as a randomized clinical trial as a\nlimitation of its funding source, but we believed a contemporaneous\nintervention/control study, which had overlapping cohorts in time, was\nthe next best robust study design to pursue. Second, our combined\nstrategy of multiple interventions precludes the determination of the\nsuccess or failure of any one component of the strategy. Additionally,\nlayering on POC VL testing on top of routine care, where providers were\nnot prevented from ordering routine SOC VL testing, further limits the\ninterpretation of our findings. Third, some spillover effects from\nintervention to control participants may have occurred. Though our\nintervention package was only offered to intervention group\nparticipants, it was the same providers caring for control group\nparticipants. We observed greater fidelity in conducting SOC VL tests in\nthe control group than expected and, anecdotally, increased confidence\nin facility staff over time in managing women with viraemia. Our\nrandomized trial in children faced this same issue \\[ 22 \\]. Alternative\nstudy designs, such as facility‐level cluster randomization, may avoid\npotential spillover effects though would require greater resources.\nFourth, we note that VS was assessed more frequently in the intervention\nversus control group, so, theoretically, the intervention group\nparticipants had a greater number of opportunities to act on their test\nresults but also greater opportunities to detect viraemia. Ultimately,\nrestrictions and reagent stockouts related to COVID‐19 greatly\ncompromised our ability to conduct POC VL testing every 3 months or\nreturn results within 24 hours as planned. Thus, it is possible that\nintervention group participants did not receive sufficient POC VL\ntesting to impact their outcomes. While the impacts of COVID‐19 may not\nbe as significant in the future, it is likely that similar programmatic\nchallenges will persist. Lastly, potential measurement bias in\nintention‐to‐treat estimates and selection bias due to missing outcome\ndata (on approximately 15--20% of our enrolled participants) are\nlimitations; however, our sensitivity analysis using inverse probability\nweighting substantiated our primary outcome analysis findings.\n\n\n## 5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn a prospective cohort study with an intervention/control study design\nwith the intervention consisting of a combined strategy of POC with\nhigher frequency VL testing, targeted DRM testing and clinical\ndecision‐making support versus SOC, we observed high rates of VS at 6\nmonths postpartum in both groups and no difference between the\nintervention and control groups during pregnancy, at delivery or\npostpartum. Nonetheless, a sizeable number of women experienced\nviraemia, when considering SVS throughout pregnancy and postpartum\nperiods, many of whom had major DRMs. POC VL uptake was high and DRM\ntesting was feasible. Ultimately, it remains unclear what interventions\npregnant/postpartum women with viraemia need to optimize VS, their\nhealth outcomes and help prevent vertical transmission.\n\n\n## FUNDING\n\nThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Allergy and\nInfectious Diseases of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH, CFAR\nNIA 2P30AI027757‐31 and R21 R21AI145450).

Random sampling was conducted on lists of eligible participants on ART between 2019 and 2021 at 15 treatment clinics supported by the United States Military HIV Research Program (MHRP) and The U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in Tanzania.\"\nRationale: The study was conducted in the Southern Highland zone of Tanzania, and the samples were obtained from participants in this region.\nAnswer: Tanzania\n\nPMID: 37167996\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Methods\nIn this multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial, we enrolled pregnant women aged 18 years or older with confirmed HIV-1 infection at 14–28 weeks of gestation. Women were enrolled at 22 clinical research sites in nine countries (Botswana, Brazil, India, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, USA, and Zimbabwe). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three oral regimens: dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate; dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; or efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Up to 14 days of the antepartum ART before enrolment was permitted. Women with known multiple gestation, fetal anomalies, acute significant illness, creatinine more than 2·5 times the upper limit of normal, or estimated creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL/min were excluded. Primary safety analyses were pairwise comparisons between ART regimens of the proportion of maternal and infant adverse events of grade 3 or higher up to 50 weeks post partum. Secondary efficacy analyses at 50 weeks post partum included comparison of the proportion of women with plasma HIV-1 RNA of less than 200 copies per mL in the combined dolutegravir-containing groups versus the efavirenz-containing group. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned participants with available data.

While 19 (54%) of these women had at least one HIV drug resistance mutation at virologic failure, most of these mutations were also detected in their enrollment samples. At study entry, drug resistance mutations were detected in 15 (36%) of 42 women with virologic failure, including 10 women in the efavirenz/emitricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group, and 5 women in the dolutegravir-containing groups.\nRationale: The paper mentions that 42 women experienced virological failure and had genotypic resistance testing performed. 42 at study entry and 35 at the time of failure.\nAnswer: 42\n\nPMID: 37167996\nQuestion ID: 10\nQuestion: What method was used for sequencing?\nEvidence: In this multisite trial, we randomised women living with HIV between 14 and 28 weeks of gestation at 22 clinical research sites in nine countries (Botswana, Brazil, India, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, the USA, and Zimbabwe) to start one of three oral regimens: dolutegravir+emitricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide; dolutegravir+emitricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; or efavirenz/emitricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

Based on enrolled patients’ characteristics, we described these measures in those with (prior ART group) and without (tenofovir-only group) prior non-tenofovir-based first-line ART using Wilcoxon rank sum and Fisher's exact tests.\n\nResults\nAmong 333 participants (55% female; median age 41 years; median CD4 336 cells/µL), detectable (>40 copies/mL) VL was found in 18%, and VL>1000 copies/mL (WHO threshold) in 10%. Virologic failure at both thresholds was significantly higher in 217 participants in the tenofovir-only group compared with 116 in the prior ART group using both cut-offs (24% vs. 7% with VL>40 copies/mL; 15% vs. 1% with VL>1000 copies/mL). Failure in the tenofovir-only group was associated with lower CD4 values and advanced WHO stage. In 35 available genotypes from 51 participants in the tenofovir-only group with VL>40 copies/mL (69% subtype A), any resistance was found in 89% and dual-class resistance in 83%. Tenofovir signature mutation K65R occurred in 71% (17/24) of the patients infected with subtype A.

Plasma samples were obtained\nfrom HIV-1 patients at Chongqing Public Health Medical Center from July\n2019 to August 2022. Besides, amplification, sequence, and analysis of\nthe portion of the HIV-1 pol gene that encodes the integrase protein\nwere implemented to identify INSTI resistance. Integrase sequence data\nwas harvested for a comprehensive cohort of 1032 patients infected with\nHIV-1. This cohort consisted of 564 ART-naive patients, 465 ART-treated\npatients, and 3 patients with an unknown treatment history. Within the\nstudy group, we identified INSTI resistance in 21 patients (2.03%,\n21/1032), including 17 ART-treated patients (3.66%, 17/465). Among the\nART-treated patients, 12 were INSTI-treated (11.76%, 12/102), 5 were\nINSTI-naive (1.38%, 5/363), and 4 were ART-ineffective patients (0.71%,\n4/564). The prevalent major resistance mutation was Q148R (0.48%,\n5/1032), while the most prevalent accessory resistance mutation was\nE157Q (1.65%, 17/1032). In light of the above, it is recommended that\nthe incidence of accessory genotype analysis should be considered before\nstarting any future INSTI-based therapy, especially in patients with\ndrug resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs and the reduction of INSTI\nsensitivity should be carefully monitored and investigated. Regular\nmonitoring for resistance should be implemented after the use of INSTIs,\nand, importantly, ongoing monitoring of the decreasing susceptibility to\nINSTIs is crucial following the initiation of treatment with INSTIs.\n\n\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Ethics statement\n\nThis study was approved by the ethics committee of Chongqing Public\nHealth Medical Center and conducted in accordance with the Declaration\nof Helsinki (2008). All data were analysed anonymously, and the\nrequirement for written or oral informed consent was waived.\n\n### Study population\n\nHIV-1-infected inpatients and outpatients who visited Chongqing Public\nHealth Medical Center between July 2019 and August 2022 were enrolled in\nthis study. Plasma samples were collected from patients with HIV-1 viral\nload (VL) greater than 1,000 copies/ml and subjected to a subsequent\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the IN gene. Data on the\npatient's general condition, transmission route, VL, CD4 ^+^ T-cell\ncount, and ART history were collected. Blood samples were drawn into\nEDTA-containing tubes, and subsequently, plasma samples were obtained\nfollowing centrifugation. The plasma samples were then analysed for\nHIV-1 RNA VL employing the Roche HIV-1 nucleic Acid Quantitative\nDetection System (HiScript®Ampli Prep/COBAS®Taq COBAS®HIV-1 Test, 2.0).\n\n### Genotypic resistance testing\n\nWhole blood samples were harvested and centrifuged at 3000×g for\n15 minutes to remove leucocytes, and then plasma (supernatant) was\nharvested for RNA extraction. HIV-RNA was extracted utilizing a viral\nnucleic acid extraction kit (Jiangsu Shuoshi), followed by amplification\nof the target fragment by nested PCR. The HIV-1 IN gene was amplified by\na validated In-house method. The first round of PCR was completed\nutilizing the HiScript®II one-step RT-PCR kit (Nanjing Vazyme, China).\nThe second round was implemented with the help of an Ace Taq kit\n(Nanjing Vazyme, China) for nested PCR amplification of target sequences\n(1157--1213 bp) with two primer sets (4007F and 5219 R for the first\nround of PCR and 4063F and 5219 R for the second round of PCR) ( Table 1\n). Then, sequences were subjected to the regularly updated Stanford\nHIV-1 Drug Resistance Database ( http://hivdb.stanford.edu/ ) to analyse\nINSTI drug resistance mutations and antiretroviral susceptibility.\nAccordingly, drug resistance is categorized into five levels: S\n(susceptible), P (potential low-level), L (low-level), I (intermediate),\nand H (high-level). Strains exhibiting the latter three levels were\nconsidered drug-resistant strains.\n\n### Phylogenetic analysis\n\nThe pol region is widely recognized as a reliable region for HIV-1\nsubtyping analysis. For subtype analysis, HIV-1 genotypes were estimated\nemploying the REGA HIV-1 Subtype Analysis Tool version 3.0 (\nhttp://dbpartners.stanford.edu:8080/RegaSubtyping/stanford-hiv/typingtool/\n) and substantiated through additional analysis. The newly characterized\npartial pol gene sequences (IN) were aligned with the subtype reference\nsequences retrieved from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database (\nhttp://www.hiv.lanl.gov/ ) utilizing the CLUSTAL W alignment tool. For\nphylogenetic analysis, 21 reference sequences or all sequences for each\nisoform were chosen. A phylogenetic tree was prepared with the help of\n1000 bootstrap repeats using Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis\n(MEGA) software version 6 ( https://www.megasoftware.net/home ),\nemploying the neighbour-joining method and the Tamura-Nei model. A\nKimura two-parameter model with a transition-transformation rate of 2.0\nwas prepared in our study, and scale bars represented a 2% genetic\ndistance.\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Characteristics of the patients\n\nSamples were harvested from 1080 patients, and successful amplification\nof the IN gene was achieved in 1032 samples ( Figure 1 ). The\ndemographic characteristics of all enrolled patients ( *n* = 1032,\nmedian age of 52 years, ranging from 12 to 89 years) are depicted in\nTable 2 . Among those patients, 79.26% were male with a median age of\n50 years (range 12 to 89 years), and 20.73% were female with a median\nage of 54 years (range 14 to 80 years). In addition, 98.16% of the\npatients identified as Han ethnicity. Additionally, heterosexual\nactivity and men having sex with other men were identified as the two\nmain routes of transmission among the included patients. Considering the\nclinical information, 564 patients were confirmed as patients on\nART-naive, representing 54.65% of the study population (564/1032), while\nthe treatment status of three patients remained unknown. The remaining\npatients on ART (45.06%, 465/1032) were treated with dolutegravir,\nrilpivirine, lamivudine, tenofovir, crizaline and efavirenz, among\nothers.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nFlow chart of our study.(INSTI integrase strand transfer inhibitor;ART\nantiretroviral therapy;DR drug resistance).\n\n### Resistance mutations to INSTIs\n\nOut of the total of 1032 patients, 4.17% (43/1032) exhibited major\nand/or accessory INSTI resistance mutations, with major mutations\npresent in 1.45% (15/1032) of cases and accessory mutations present in\n2.71% (28/1032) of cases. A total of 21 patients showed mutations\nassociated with INSTI resistance ( Table 3 ). Information on the INSTI\nresistance mutations associated with specific drugs is exhibited in\nTable 4 . Three cases exhibited mutations associated with high-level\nresistance to bictegravir(BIC), eight cases showed high-level resistance\nto cabotegravir(CAB), four had high-level resistance to\ndolutegravir(DTG), thirteen had high-level resistance to\nelvitegravir(EVG), and ten had high-level resistance to\nraltegravir(RAL). Mutations leading to medium-level resistance to BIC,\nCAB, DTG, EVG, and RAL were observed in five, one, four, one, and four\ncases, respectively. Mutations leading to low-level resistance to BIC,\nCAB, DTG, EVG, and RAL were discovered in one, eleven, seven, seven, and\nseven cases, respectively.\n\nThe Q148R mutation was the most commonly observed major INSTI resistance\nmutation, with a resistance rate of 0.48% (5/1032). The E138K/A mutation\noccurred more frequently (0.39%, 4/1032). The G118R mutation is a\nnonpolymorphic mutation with a mutation frequency of 0.39% (4/1032). The\nE92Q mutation is a common non-polymorphic mutation with a mutation\nfrequency of 0.29% (3/1032). The E157Q mutation was the most frequently\nobserved accessory INSTI resistance mutation, with a frequency of 1.65%\n(17/1032). The S230R mutation leads to a resistance rate of 0.58%\n(6/1032) ( Table 5 ).\n\nThe study participants were then categorized into ART-naive and\nART-treated groups. We primarily observed major and/or accessory\nmutations, which resulted in resistance to INSTIs, within the group of\nART-treated patients (3.66%, 17/465). The patients in the ART-treated\ngroup were sub-divided into INSTI-treated and INSTI-naive groups. Among\nthe seventeen patients with INSTI resistance, twelve were INSTI-treated\n(11.76%, 12/102), and five were INSTI-naive (1.38%, 5/363). Among\npatients treated with INSTIs, varying combinations of major and/or\naccessory resistance mutations resulted in diverse degrees of drug\nresistance to INSTIs. In one patient, the major resistance mutations\nE138K plus the major resistance mutations G118R resulted in high-level\nresistance to all INSTIs (H1718 in Table 3 ). In another patient, the\nmajor resistance mutations E138K, S147G, and Q148R plus the accessory\nmutation A128T caused high-level resistance to all INSTIs (H4778 in\nTable 3 ). In the remaining patients, major resistance mutations E138K,\nS147G, Q148R, and R263K without accessory mutations resulted in\nhigh-level resistance to all INSTIs (H3944 in Table 3 ). In ART-naive\npatients, accessory resistance mutations (S230R) (0.71%, 4/564) ( Table\n3 ) in four patients resulted in low-level resistance to RAL, EVG, CAB,\nand DTG.\n\nPrimarily, INSTI resistance was identified in the CRF07_BC subtype of\nthe virus. A phylogenetic analysis of the IN gene demonstrated that the\nsequenced strains could be categorized into 13 different subtypes (\nFigure 2 ). The prevalence of each subtype was: A (0.39%, 4/1032), B\n(1.16%, 12/1032), C (2.42%, 25/1032), CRF01_AE (19.86%, 205/1032),\nCRF07_BC (57.66%, 595/1032), CRF08_BC (14.24%, 147/1032), CRF55_01B\n(2.42%, 25/1032), CRF52_01B (0.78%, 8/1032), CRF59_01B (0.19%, 2/1032),\nCRF67_01B (0.09%, 1/1032), CRF77_cpx (0.09%, 1/1032), CRF78_cpx (0.09%,\n1/1032), and CRF85_BC (0.58%, 6/1032). Circulating recombinant forms\naccounted for 95.63% of all subtypes (987/1032), with CRF07_BC and\nCRF01_AE being the major recombinant strains ( Table 6 ).\n\nFigure 2.\n\nA phylogenetic analysis of the in gene.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAccording to the Chinese Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of\nHIV/AIDS (2021) in China, authored by the AIDS and Hepatitis C\nProfessional Group (2021), ART treatment plans that include INSTIs have\nbeen established as the standard care for patients infected with HIV-1\n\\[ ^15^ \\]. However, with the widespread use of INSTIs, INSTI-related\ndrug resistance mutations have gradually emerged. This study aimed to\nassess the prevalence of HIV INSTI-associated drug resistance mutations\nin Chongqing from July 2019 to August 2022, making it the first\ninvestigation to examine the status of drug resistance related to INSTIs\nin Chongqing, China. In the current study, we identified four cases of\ntransmitted resistance to INSTIs, resulting in a prevalence of INSTI\nresistance of 0.71% (4/564) in ART-naïve patients. Among these four\npatients, no major drug resistance mutations were detected, except for a\nsingle accessory mutation (S230R) associated with low levels of\nresistance to CAB, DTG, EVG, and RAL.\n\nINSTI resistance rates among primary ART patients were higher than in\nHenan (0.63%) \\[ ^4^ \\] and Beijing (0.34%) \\[ ^16^ \\] but lower than in\nJiangsu (0.76%) \\[ ^13^ \\] and Yunnan \\[ ^12^ \\] (5.7%), suggesting a\nlow transmission rate of pre-treatment INSTI resistant variants.\n\nImportantly, prolonged use of first-generation INSTIs RAL and EVG can\nlead to rapid development of drug resistance. This study identified\nmoderate-to-high-level resistance to RAL and EVG in 12 of 102\nINSTI-treated patients, highlighting a resistance rate of 11.76%. This\nproportion closely aligns with the resistance rate reported in Henan\nProvince (14.63%) \\[ ^4^ \\]. It is well-known that many patients who\nwere prescribed RAL or EVG did not undergo INSTI resistance testing\nprior to the initiation of their treatment. In fact, almost all of these\npatients treated with INSTIs in Chongqing have HIV and exhibit\nresistance to NNRTIs or NRTIs. Resistance to NNRTIs and/or NRTIs before\ntreatment has been validated to increase the risk of developing\nresistance to INSTIs. Specifically, the five ART-treated patients in our\nstudy who had resistance to INSTIs (regimens without INSTIs) were all\nresistant to NNRTIs and/or NRTIs. The highest mutation frequency of\n41.67% (5/12) was found in Q148R. Q148H/K/R are non-polymorphic\nmutations reported in persons receiving RAL, EVG, CAB, and DTG. These\nmutations typically occur in combination with G140A/S or E138K. In this\ncontext, these mutations share a linkage with near complete resistance\nto RAL and EVG, high levels of reduction in CAB susceptibility, and\nlow-to-intermediate reductions in DTG and BIC susceptibility. The G118R\nmutation had a high prevalence of 33.33% (4/12). This mutation is the\nmajor resistance mutation commonly responsible for DTG and CAB\nresistance. Three patients showed high resistance to all five INSTIs.\nAll three patients with high resistance to each of the five INSTIs had\nthe E138K resistance mutation. Two of them had concomitant Q148R\nmutations, and two of them had mutations in S147G, which reduced\nsensitivity to EVG. Besides, E138K/A are non-polymorphic mutations that\noften develop in patients taking RAL, EVG, and DTG. Typically, these\nmutations co-occur with Q148 mutations. On their own, they do not reduce\nINSTI susceptibility. Nevertheless, when they occur in tandem with Q148\nmutations, they result in high-level resistance to RAL and EVG, as well\nas intermediate reductions in susceptibility to DTG and BIC.\n\nOur study has several limitations, including the exclusive utilization\nof the IN gene in the phylogenetic analysis, which could potentially\nlimit the accuracy of subtyping and the recognition of CRF.\nAdditionally, Sanger dideoxy sequencing was employed for the\nidentification of the clinically significant known drug resistance\nmutations. Even though Sanger sequencing is confirmed as the gold\nstandard approach for HIV drug resistance testing, it is incapable of\nidentifying variants within the viral population that exhibit less than\n20% drug resistance. The method may underestimate the true prevalence of\ndrug-resistant mutations in treatment-naive patients.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAlthough no major resistance mutations were identified in ART-naïve\npatients, ART experience patients in Chongqing had an incidence of 1.45%\nfor major resistance mutations related to INSTI. In patients who had\nused INSTIs, the incidence of major resistance mutations was as high as\n11.76%. Those patients with potential low-level or low-level drug\nresistance to INSTIs can be treated with INSTIs in combination with\nother classes of drugs while those with intermediate- or high-level drug\nresistance, particularly against second-generation INSTIs, should be\nfully evaluated as such patients are generally associated with\nhigh-level resistance to other classes of drugs. Additionally, patients\nresistant to NNRTIs or NRTIs will experience increased resistance to\nINSTIs. Therefore, it is essential to consider conducting accessory\ngenotype analysis before starting any future INSTI-based therapy,\nespecially in patients with drug resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs.\nAdditionally, it is crucial to continually monitor and investigate any\nreduction in INSTI sensitivity. Resistance should be monitored more\nregularly after INSTIs have been used. More importantly, the decreasing\nsusceptibility to INSTIs should be monitored regularly following the\ninitiation of treatment with INSTIs.\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThis work was supported by the Chongqing medical scientific research\nproject (Joint project of Chongqing Health Commission and Science and\nTechnology Bureau, grant number 2023MSXM044), Technology Innovation and\nApplication Development Project of Science and Technology Commission of\nShapingba(District grant number 202318).\n\n\n## Data Availability statement\n\nThe data in this study are available from the first author (HZ.Z) on\nreasonable request.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 35300056\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Methods: 865 ART-naive patients were enrolled in this study between January 2019 and June 2021 in Beijing. The amplification of the entire pol gene containing the reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase regions was performed using a validated In-house SBS method. HIV-1 subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) were determined using the COMET online tool (http://comet.retrovirology.lu). Stanford HIV-1 drug resistance database (HIVdb version 8.9) was used to analyze the mutations.\nResults: 865 HIV-1 pol sequences were successfully amplified and sequenced. Among them, no major INSTI-related mutations were identified, but 12 polymorphic accessory mutations were found. Two patients have E138A and G163R mutations respectively and both could cause low-level resistance to RAL and EVG. Furthermore, one patient having S230R mutation resulted in low-level resistance to RAL, EVG, DTG and BIC.\nRationale: The paper focuses on the sequencing and analysis of HIV-1 pol gene mutations in patient samples and does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 36578581\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \" Abstract\n\nIntegrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-containing regimens in HIV-1-infected patients have experienced a global increase. Recently, WHO has emphasized the need to fast-track the transition to dolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral (ARV) treatments. However, continued surveillance of INSTI resistance is recommended. In this study, clinical, epidemiological, and virological features associated with INSTI resistance diagnosed in Spain were analyzed. Samples collected between 2008 and 2021 from HIV-1-infected patients were analyzed in integrase, protease, and reverse transcriptase using Sanger population sequencing. ARV drug resistance was evaluated with the Stanford University HIVdb program. Among 2,696 patients, 174 (6.5%) had INSTI resistance, all of them to first-generation INSTIs, and 71 (2.6%) had also resistance to second-generation INSTIs. Of these, only 5 individuals were exposed to DTG as the only INSTI, in whom resistance development was associated with poor treatment adherence and/or resistance to other ARV classes. Of newly HIV-1-diagnosed individuals, 0.92% harbored INSTI-resistant viruses, with low prevalences maintained along time, and only one had low-level resistance to DTG. Persons who inject drugs, age over 39 years, resistance to other ARV classes, and longer time from diagnosis were associated with INSTI resistance (p < 0.001). Non-subtype B INSTI-resistant viruses lacked the Q148H + G140S resistance pathway and showed lower INSTI resistance levels than subtype B viruses. In conclusion, INSTI resistance is uncommon and associated with long-term infections, older age and additional resistance to other ARV drug classes, and is rare in newly diagnosed HIV-1 infections. Our results also support the preferential use of DTG-containing regimens in first-line treatments, although surveillance of INSTI resistance is encouraged.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the analysis of drug resistance mutations and their prevalence in patient samples, but it does not mention conducting in vitro drug susceptibility tests.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 36578581\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: The most frequent INSTI in the treatment regimens of patients with INSTI resistance was RAL, used in 58%, followed by EVG, used in 7.5%, and DTG, used in 4.6%.

A phylogenetic tree was constructed using\nMolecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis (MEGA) software (version X)\nbased on the maximum likelihood method and general time reversible model\nwith 1000 bootstrap replicates. Statistical analysis was carried out\nusing SPSS (version 25.0; Chicago, IL, USA). The measurement data of\nnormal distribution were expressed as mean ± standard deviation.\nIndependent-samples *t* -test was used for group comparison. The skew\ndistribution data were expressed as median (interquartile range\n\\[IQR\\]), and the Wilcoxon test for independent samples was used for\ncomparison between groups. Categorical variables were expressed as\nnumbers or percentages. Chi-squared test was used for comparison between\ngroups, and univariate logistic regression was used for analysis of risk\nfactors. All statistical tests were bilateral, and *P* \\<0.05 indicated\nstatistically significant differences.\n\nThe analysis included a total of 921 HIV-1 patients, with a median age\nof 43 (IQR, 30--53) years. Male patients constituted 73.9% (681/921) of\nthe study population. Han ethnicity accounted for 99.5% (916/921) of the\ntotal patients. Further, 58.1% (535/921) of the patients were married\nand 41.9% (386/921) were single. Farmers accounted for 44.4% (409/921)\nof the total patients, followed by workers (36.9%, 340/921), non-workers\n(16.2%, 149/921), and students (2.5%, 23/921). Transmission route data\nwere available for 921 patients, including those who underwent\nplasmapheresis constituting 32.5% (299/921), followed by those with\nheterosexual orientation (30.2%, 278/921), men who have sex with men\n(MSM) (22.6%, 208/921), mother-to-child transmission (10.5%, 97/921),\nand other or unknown data (4.2%, 39/921). Baseline CD4 ^+^ T-cell count\ndata were available for 894 patients; the median CD4 ^+^ T-cell count\nwas 81.5 cells/μL (IQR, 23.0--207.3). Baseline HIV-1 viral load (VL)\ndata were available for 858 patients; the median baseline VL was\n18,698.5 (min/max, 202.0--39,771,796.0) copies/μL. Detailed demographic\ndata of the patients are listed in Supplementary Table 1,\nhttp://links.lww.com/CM9/B763 .\n\nA total of 1078 patients who failed in ART treatment, the partial pol\ngene sequence was successfully amplified in 921, and the integrase (INT)\ngene sequence in 751 patients. The partial pol gene sequences were also\nsuccessfully amplified in all the patients whose INT genes were\nsequenced. The prevalence of each subtype was as follows: B (59.5%,\n548/921), CRF01_AE (23.7%, 218/921), CRF07_BC (10.0%, 92/921), CRF55_01B\n(5.3%, 49/921), CRF08_BC (1.0%, 9/921), C (0.3%, 3/921), CRF68_01B\n(0.01%, 1/921), and G (0.01%, 1/921) \\[Supplementary Table 2,\nhttp://links.lww.com/CM9/B763 \\]. Based on the inferred phylogenetic\ntree \\[Supplementary Figure 1, http://links.lww.com/CM9/B763 \\], all the\ndetermined subtypes clustered with reference strains, indicating\nconsistent results and correct subtyping.\n\nAmong the 921 patients, 748 patients (81.2%) had one or more DRMs for\nany drug class. When analyzed by individual drug class, the incidence of\nDRMs was 71.1% (655/921), 78.3% (721/921), 5.2% (48/921), and 3.1%\n(23/751) for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs),\nnon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease\ninhibitors (PIs), and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs),\nrespectively. The most common DRMs included M184V/I (576, 62.5%) for\nNRTIs, K103N/R (294, 31.9%) for NNRTIs, I54V (35, 3.8%) for PIs, and\nE157Q (25, 3.3%) for INSTIs \\[Supplementary Table 3,\nhttp://links.lww.com/CM9/B763 \\]. For individual drugs, the most\nfrequent high-level, medium-level, low-level, and potential low-level\nresistant drug were NVP, ETR, ABC, and ETR, respectively. Based on\ngenotypes, DRMs mostly involved are CRF55_01B (91.8%, 35/49) and\nCRF01_AE (89.4%, 195/218), followed by B (79.2%, 434/548), CRF07_BC\n(71.7%, 66/94), and others/recombinants (57.1%, 8/14). A significant\ndifference was found in the incidence of DRMs among different subtypes (\n*P* \\<0.05; Supplementary Table 2, http://links.lww.com/CM9/B763 ).\nDetails of DRMs involving resistance to first- and second-line treatment\nregimens are presented in Figure ​ Figure1 1 .\n\nFigure 1\n\nPredicted resistance to antiretroviral drugs among HIV-1 nucleotide\nsequences in treatment experienced patients with\ndrug-resistance-associated mutation: Henan, 2018--2022.

When analyzed by age group, the incidence of DRMs was similar\nin the following age groups: 20--29 years, 30--39 years, 40--49 years,\nand 50--59 years. However, the incidence was lower in those aged 60\nyears or older as well as those younger than 20 years. Based on ART\nduration, the incidence of drug resistance tended to decrease with the\nextension of treatment time, from 92.5% (\\<1 year, 86/93) to 79.2% (≥5\nyears, 259/453), suggesting that short ART duration might be a risk\nfactor for DRMs, but there was no significant difference ( *P* \\>0.05).\nThe incidence of DRMs in ART regimens containing NNRTI, PI, and\nintegrase inhibitor (INI) was 87.7% (582/664), 63.8% (125/196), and\n71.0% (22/31), respectively \\[Supplementary Table 4,\nhttp://links.lww.com/CM9/B763 \\].\n\nGenerally, a delay of few weeks to months existed between blood sampling\nfor viral load determination and genotypic drug resistance analysis.\nTherefore, PLWH with poor adherence might have restarted their treatment\nregimens, which could have subsequently suppressed viremia and thus\nfailure to genotypic drug resistance due to low viral load. The pol gene\nwas successfully amplified in 921 out of 1078 patients, and the INT gene\nwas analyzed in 751 patients. INSTIs were not freely available to\npatients and were not covered by medical insurance in most provinces of\nChina before 2022, so only a limited number of patients were treated\nwith INSTIs and resistance testing against INSTIs was deemed unnecessary\nin clinical settings. Phylogenetic analysis based on the determined\npartial pol gene sequences indicated that the most common subtype was B,\nwhich accounted for 59.5%, followed by CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, CRF55_01B,\nand CRF08_BC, which is consistent with subtype patterns in other regions\n^\\[\\ 3\\ ,\\ 4\\ \\]^ and our previous study. ^\\[\\ 1\\ \\]^\n\nOur data showed that the incidence of DRMs was 81.2% (748/921), which is\nconsistent with the incidence worldwide (47--90%); however, it was\nsignificantly higher than that of 52--57% reported previously in China.\n^\\[\\ 5\\ \\]^ This might be explained by historical reasons as Henan\nprovince harbored the earliest group of PLWH due to illicit blood\ndonation. When categorized by drug classes, the incidence of DRMs was\n71.1% (655/921), 78.3% (721/921), 5.2% (48/921), and 3.1% (23/921) for\nNRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs, and INSTIs, respectively, which is consistent with\nthe data reported previously. ^\\[\\ 5\\ ,\\ 6\\ \\]^ In this survey, we found\nthat the incidence of DRMs was the highest in patients with NNRTI-based\nregimens (582/664, 87.7%), followed by PI (125/196, 63.8%) and INSTI\n(22/31, 71.0%)-based regimens, which is consistent with previously\nreported incidence (50--97%) of DRMs to NNRTIs in patients who failed\nART involving NNRTI-based regimens. ^\\[\\ 5\\ ,\\ 6\\ \\]^ The higher\nincidence of DRMs against NNRTIs might be attributed to their lower\nresistance barrier and the frequent use as a first-line therapy. We\nfurther divided the patients into three groups according to the duration\nof ART. Although no significant differences ( *P* \\>0.05) were found,\nthe incidence of DRMs was the highest in patients with an ART duration\nof less than one year (86/93, 92.5%), followed by 1--5 years (276/355,\n82.4%) and more than 5 years (359/453, 79.2%). Further studies are\nneeded to determine the cause of this phenomenon.\n\nThe incidence of DRMs against lamivudine (3TC) was 63.4%. However,\nDovato, a combination of 3TC/dolutegravir (DTG) in a single tablet,\nshowed comparable efficacy in suppressing viremia even in the presence\nof DRMs against 3TC, possibly due to the high efficacy of DTG.\n^\\[\\ 6\\ \\]^ The incidence of DRMs in patients treated with PI-based\nregimens was 63.8%, which is significantly lower than in NRTI- and\nNNRTI-based regimens, possibly due to its high resistance barriers and\nefficacy. In case of INSTIs, all levels (high/mid/low) of resistance\nwere observed for drugs (BIC, Cabotegravir (CAB), DTG, EVG, and RAL)\nwhile resistance against EVG and RAL, the most widely used, was the most\ncommon. PLWH showing medium- or high-level resistance to BIC, CAB or DTG\nwere rare and generally associated with extensive resistance to all\nclasses of drugs. In this study, we also observed a proportion of PLWH\nwith viremia but undetectable DRMs. Further investigations indicated\nthat almost all of them showed poor adherence to treatment. In addition,\nPLWH with a viral load \\>200 copies/mL was selected in this study, and\nonly 85% was successfully amplified. We will determine the prescribed\ndrug levels in plasma samples and optimize the genotypic drug resistance\ntesting method to address this question in future studies.\n\nIn summary, the incidence of DRMs is high for commonly used NRTIs and\nNNRTIs and is low for commonly prescribed PIs and INSTIs in Henan\nProvince. Poor adherence to ART is a key challenge, which may have\ncontributed substantially to the high incidence of DRMs in patients\nundergoing ART and elevate the risk in PLWH with viremia but no\ndetectable DRMs. Education regarding adherence to regimens is essential\nto improve therapeutic efficacy and prevent the emergence of DRMs.\n\n\n## Funding\n\nThis study was supported by grants from the Science and Technology\nResearch Project of Henan Province (Nos.

Unraveling the mechanisms\nbehind NSV would broaden our understanding of HIV-1 persistence. Here we\nanalyzed plasma virus sequences in eight ART-treated individuals with\nNSV (88% male) and show that they are composed of large clones without\nevidence of viral evolution over time in those with longitudinal\nsamples. We defined proviruses that match plasma HIV-1 RNA sequences as\n'producer proviruses', and those that did not as 'non-producer\nproviruses'. Non-suppressible viremia arose from expanded clones of\nproducer proviruses that were significantly larger than the\ngenome-intact proviral reservoir of ART-suppressed individuals.\nIntegration sites of producer proviruses were enriched in proximity to\nthe activating H3K36me3 epigenetic mark. CD4 ^+^ T cells from\nparticipants with NSV demonstrated upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes\nand downregulation of pro-apoptotic and type I/II interferon-related\npathways. Furthermore, participants with NSV showed significantly lower\nHIV-specific CD8 ^+^ T cell responses compared with untreated viremic\ncontrollers with similar viral loads. We identified potential critical\nhost and viral mediators of NSV that may represent targets to disrupt\nHIV-1 persistence.\n\n\n## Main\n\nFor the majority of persons with human immunodeficiency virus (PWH),\nantiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV-1 RNA to below the level of\ncommercial assay detection ^1\\ --\\ 5^ . However, a subset of PWH\ndemonstrate persistent low-level viremia while on ART ^6\\ ,\\ 7^ , a\ncondition that not only represents a clinical conundrum for the\nclinician but can lead to substantial stigma and distress for the\npatient. Persistent low-level viremia has historically been attributed\nto suboptimal ART adherence and/or accumulating human immunodeficiency\nvirus-1 (HIV-1) drug resistance ^8\\ ,\\ 9^ . Previous studies supporting\nthe presence of active viral replication have reported that ART\nresistance mutations can accumulate when viremia persists in the low but\ndetectable range ^10\\ ,\\ 11^ and that low-level viremia can increase the\nrisk of virologic failure ^12^ . However, there has been intriguing\nevidence that persistent low-level viremia can be maintained for long\nperiods without leading to high-level virologic failure or the\ndevelopment of new resistance mutations ^13\\ --\\ 18^ . This subset of\nindividuals with persistent low-level viremia without evidence of ART\nnon-adherence or meaningful drug resistance are defined as having\nnon-suppressible HIV-1 viremia (NSV).\n\nClonal expansion of HIV-infected cells represents a key contributing\nfactor for HIV-1 persistence, and recent studies have suggested that\nthis plays an important role in NSV as well. Halvas et al. also studied\na cohort of participants with NSV, reporting that the majority of plasma\nvariants were composed of clusters of identical sequences without signs\nof viral evolution, which is consistent with the plasma viruses\noriginating from a transcriptionally active viral reservoir rather than\nnew rounds of infection ^1^ . While NSV was fueled by large populations\nof clonally expanded HIV-infected cells, the mechanisms that lead to the\nestablishment and maintenance of NSV, and the NSV-generating proviral\nreservoirs, remain understudied. In this Article, we characterized a\ncohort of eight participants with NSV, and performed in-depth ART drug\nconcentration testing, alongside viral and host cell genetics/genomics\nand immune profiling. We identified features of host integration sites\nthat differentiated proviruses fueling NSV from those that were not\ncontributory. Transcriptomic and immunologic phenotyping studies further\nhighlight potentially permissive host cell and cellular immune\nenvironments in patients with NSV. These results provide the most\ncomprehensive evaluation so far of the viral, cellular and immune\nmediators of NSV.\n\n\n\n## Participant characteristics and assessment of ARV levels\n\nWe enrolled eight participants with ongoing NSV, 88% men, with a median\nage of 60 years and median ART duration of 10 years. The median duration\nof virologic suppression before the NSV and duration of NSV for all\nparticipants were 4 and 2 years, respectively. During the NSV episodes,\nthe median viral load was 143 copies ml ^−1^ and the median CD4 count\nwas 798 cells µl ^−1^ (Table ​ (Table1 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ).\nIndividual participant characteristics, ART regimens and genotypic\nsusceptibility scores (GSS) ^19^ of plasma viruses sequenced during NSV\nare presented in Supplementary Table 1 . All participants were receiving\nat least two active antiretroviral drugs during the NSV episodes.\nCharacteristics of the ART-suppressed and viremic controllers (VCs)\nhistorical comparator participants are presented in Supplementary Tables\n2 -- 4 .\n\nWe assessed ART adherence by quantifying antiretroviral (and their\nanabolites) drug concentrations in plasma or through dried blood spot\n(DBS) testing. LV1 and LV2 had plasma dolutegravir and darunavir\nconcentrations consistent with ongoing ART use (Supplementary Table 5 ).\nLV3 and LV5-9 had DBS tests for tenofovir (TFV-DP, a measure of\ncumulative tenofovir/tenofovir alafenamide adherence) ^20\\ ,\\ 21^ and\nemtricitabine (FTC-TP, a measure of recent emtricitabine dosing within\nthe preceding 7 days) ^22\\ ,\\ 23^ . The median (range) FTC-TP level was\n5 (4.4--6.7) pmol per punch and TFV-DP level was 3,702 (2,771--6,684)\nfmol per punch ^24^ . These concentrations are consistent with expected\nlevels in ART-suppressed individuals, including the highest odds of\nsuppression and lowest odds of future viremia ^20\\ ,\\ 23\\ ,\\ 25\\ ,\\ 26^\n, suggesting that our participants with NSV had both high levels of\nshort-term and cumulative ART adherence (Supplementary Fig. 1 and\nSupplementary Table 5 ).\n\n## Plasma NSV were composed of large clones without evolution\n\nHIV-1 integration targeting preferences are demarcated by various\nfeatures of active chromatin, including transcription ^27^ , histone\nepigenetic marks ^28^ and nuclear speckle proximity ^29^ . The reservoir\nlandscape changes over time in response to ART and the host immune\nresponse to a quasi-homeostatic state marked by cell loss and clonal\nexpansion ^30\\ --\\ 36^ . A key goal of this study was to assess aspects\nof host proviruses that contributed to NSV. Longitudinal single-genome\nsequencing of near-full-length proviruses and plasma HIV-1 *pol* - *env*\nRNA was performed.\n\nA total of 1,987 single-genome proviral sequences and 222 single-genome\nplasma sequences were generated for the eight participants with NSV.\nLongitudinal plasma HIV-1 sequences were obtained for four participants\nwith available sampling (LV1, LV7, LV8 and LV9), at a median 4.5 time\npoints, an average of 9.7 months apart (Fig. ​ (Fig.1a 1a and Extended\nData Fig. ​ Fig.1). 1 ). While the ART regimen was adjusted during the\nNSV for some participants, virologic suppression was not achieved\n(Extended Data Fig. ​ Fig.1 1 ).\n\nFig. 1\n\n**Example participant with non-suppressible viremia (LV1).**\n\n**a** , Viral loads and CD4 ^+^ T cell count from the time of virologic\nsuppression.

We next\nlooked for evidence of longitudinal HIV-1 sequence changes consistent\nwith the active infection of new cells. Neighbor joining trees of\nproviral and plasma sequences for these eight participants instead\nshowed that the plasma sequences were dominated by one or two clones,\nwith no evidence of viral evolution, consistent with plasma virus\noriginating from a transcriptionally active population of HIV-1-infected\ncells (Figs. ​ (Figs.1b 1b and ​ and2a). 2a ). For the initial analysis,\nproviral sequences were considered intact if they either did not harbor\nobvious defects or were linked to plasma sequences. At the time of study\nentry, the two largest plasma HIV-1 clones accounted for a median 71%\n(Q1--Q3: 27--83%) of all plasma sequences and were linked to a median\n26% (Q1--Q3: 14--61%) of all intact proviral sequences (Extended Data\nFig. ​ Fig.2a). 2a ). Overall, intact proviruses accounted for a median\n4.5% (Q1--Q3: 3.8--15%) of the proviral reservoir, with a high degree of\nvariation evident from two participants (LV2 and LV9). LV2 and LV9\nproviruses were dominated by several large clones of intact sequences\nthat represented 76% and 34% of their total peripheral blood mononuclear\ncell (PBMC) proviral reservoirs, respectively (Extended Data Figs. 2b,c\n).\n\nFig. 2\n\n**Sequencing overview of the non-suppressible viremia cohort.**\n\n**a** , Neighbor joining trees show intact proviral and plasma sequences\nfrom different time points.

Median and interquartile\nranges are labeled in the violin plot. Two-sided Wilcoxon matched-pairs\nsigned-rank test and Mann--Whitney *U* tests were used for comparisons.\n\nExtended Data Fig. 2\n\n**Reservoir size and composition for non-suppressible viremia\nparticipants (Supplementary to Fig. 2 ).**\n\n\\(a\\) Comparison of proportion of the proviral and plasma HIV sequences\ncomprised of each producer clone. Red dotted lines represent higher\nplasma clone frequency and blue dotted lines present higher proviral\nclone frequency. (b) and (c) Percentage of intact and defective proviral\nspecies for each NSV participant.\n\nWe categorized proviruses as producers if they matched a plasma sequence\nand as non-producers if they did not. There was a wide range of producer\nproviruses within the reservoir. For LV2, the PBMC proviral reservoir\nwas largely composed of one large producer clone representing 98% of\nintact proviruses, which matched the large plasma NSV clone (Fig. ​\n(Fig.2a). 2a ). In contrast, LV3 had the smallest producer reservoir\nsize, representing 3.5% of total intact sequences. These results\ndemonstrate that, while these individuals share a common NSV phenotype,\ntheir proviral landscape can be highly heterogenous (Extended Data Fig.\n2b,c ).\n\nWe next compared the size of the intact and defective reservoir sizes\nbetween the participants with NSV and a control group of ten\nART-suppressed participants (Supplementary Table 2 ). Participants with\nNSV had a numerically larger total and significantly larger intact PBMC\nproviral reservoir (NSV versus ART-suppressed: median total proviral\ngenomes 34 versus 18 proviruses per million cells, *P* = 0.08; and\nmedian intact proviral genomes 4.3 versus 0.1 proviruses per million\ncells, *P* = 0.001). Specifically, the size of the producer proviral\nreservoir was significantly larger in the participants with NSV than\neither the non-producer intact proviral reservoir in these participants\nor the intact proviral reservoir in the ART-suppressed participants\n(Fig. ​ (Fig.2b). 2b ). In addition, the participants with NSV had a\nsmaller number of proviruses with large deletions (median 2.6 versus\n10.7 proviruses per million cells, *P* = 0.006). These results suggest\nthat an enlarged producer reservoir size could be a contributing factor\nto NSV.\n\n\n\n## Integration site and epigenetic signatures of producers\n\nThe location and chromatin landscape of HIV-1 proviral integration sites\ncan modulate the extent of proviral transcriptional activity ^37\\ ,\\ 38^\n. We accordingly evaluated whether certain integration site features\ndifferentiated the producer, non-producer and defective proviruses.\nUsing the Matched Integration Site and Proviral Sequencing (MIP-seq)\nprotocol ^39^ , we identified host chromosomal integration sites for 11\nproducer, 21 intact non-producer and 44 defective proviruses across all\nparticipants with NSV (we were unable to identify an integration site\nfor the LV3 producer clone). Integration sites were identified across\nall autosomal and sex chromosomes with the exception of chromosome 21\n(Fig. ​ (Fig.3a). 3a ). Compared with non-producer and defective\nproviruses, producer proviral integration sites were enriched in\nchromosome 19. Twenty-seven percent (3/11) of producer proviruses were\nlocated in chromosome 19 compared with none of the 21 non-producer and\n44 defective proviruses (producer versus non-producer *P* = 0.03 and\nproducer versus defective *P* = 0.006, Fig. ​ Fig.3b 3b ).\n\nFig. 3\n\n**Integration sites and chromatin features of HIV-1 proviruses.**\n\n**a** , Circos plot showing the location of each integration site across\nhuman chromosomes. **b** , Karyotyping heatmap showing the percentage of\nintegration sites in each human chromosome for different classes of\nproviruses. Fisher's exact test was used. **c** , Number of peaks for\nkey histone marks in 10-kb regions flanking the proviral integration\nsites. Center lines represent medians. We used Tukey boxplots, in which\nboxes represent median values and first--third quartiles. Two-sided\nKruskal--Wallis test was used to evaluate if there was significant\ndifferences among three groups and if so, two-sided Mann--Whitney *U*\ntest was used to compare between-group differences. **d** , Correlation\nbetween enrichment of H3K36me3 histone marks near producer proviral\nintegration sites and plasma clone viral loads (viral load multiplied by\nfraction of plasma sequences matching the producer provirus). Host gene\nintegration sites are labeled. Two-sided Spearman correlation test was\nused. VL, viral load.\n\nWe also observed significant enrichment of producer proviruses in\nproximity to two epigenetic markers. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation\nfollowed by sequencing (ChIP--seq) data from primary CD4 ^+^ T cells\npublished on the ROADMAP database ^40^ , we detected significantly\nhigher ChIP--seq peak numbers for the H3K36me3 and H3K9me3 histone marks\nin proximity to producer integration sites compared with either\nnon-producer or defective integration sites (Fig. ​ (Fig.3c). 3c ). We\ncalculated the level of plasma viral load contributed by the producer\nprovirus, which we designate as the plasma clone viral load. We observed\na significant positive correlation between the number of H3K36me3\nChIP--seq reads in proximity to the producer proviruses integration\nsites and the plasma clone viral load (Spearman *r* = 0.83, *P* = 0.001,\nFig. ​ Fig.3d). 3d ). Proximity to H3K36me3 has been linked to proviral\ngene expression ^38\\ ,\\ 41^ , suggesting that producer proviruses are\nenriched near transcriptionally active regions of the chromosome and\nthat producer proviruses could potentially leverage cellular\ntranscriptional machinery for proviral expression and virion production\n^37^ . In addition, a higher number of proximal ChIP--seq peak numbers\nfor two other activating histone marks (H3K27ac and H3K4me1) were linked\nto greater expression of host genes containing integrated proviruses\n(Extended Data Fig. ​ Fig.3a), 3a ), although these histone marks were\nnot enriched near producer proviruses.\n\nExtended Data Fig. 3\n\n**Integration site features (Supplementary to Fig. 3 ).**\n\n\\(a\\) Correlation between enrichment of histone marks in producer\nintegration sites and transcripts per million (TPM) from CD4 ^+^ T cell\nbulk RNA-seq results of each corresponding host gene harboring a\nprovirus. On x-axis, total peak numbers in ± 10 kb flanking regions of\nn = 11 producer, n = 21 nonproducer and n = 44 defective integration\nsites from NSV samples were compared to each host gene TPM in their\nCD4 + T cells on y-axis. Two-sided Spearman correlation tests were used\nfor the comparisons. (b) The distance of integration sites in each class\nof proviruses to the nearest transcriptional start sites (TSS). (c) The\ndistance between the integration site to the TSS when HIV-1 or host\ngenes are in the same orientation.

(e) The distance from the integration sites of different\nproviral classes to the centromere. Two-sided Kruskal-Wallis and\nMann-Whitney U tests were used for comparisons. (f) Fraction of\nintegration sites in speckle-associated domains (SPADs). Chi-squared\ntest was used for comparisons. (g) Transcriptomic level of HIV host\ngenes for producers, non-producers and defectives. For (e)-(g), n = 11\nproducer, n = 21 nonproducer and n = 44 defective integration sites from\nNSV samples were compared to each other. (h) Transcriptomic level of\nhost genes for producers, non-producers and defectives categorized by\ndirectionality to closest host genes. We compared the number of\ntranscripts per million cells for the host gene of each integrated\nprovirus, including categorizing by the relative direction of the\nprovirus to the host gene. \"+\" represents human and HIV genome in the\nsame and \"- \"represents human and HIV in the opposite orientation of\ntheir transcriptions. Total of n = 11 producer (5 integrations site in\nthe same and 6 in the opposite orientation), n = 21 nonproducer (7\nintegrations site in the same and 14 in the opposite orientation) and\nn = 44 defective (20 integrations site in the same and 24 in the\nopposite orientation) integration sites from NSV samples were compared\nto each other. All the boxplots in this figure are in the format of the\nTukey boxplot, with the center line indicating median, box limits\nindicating upper and lower quartiles and the whiskers indicating 1.5x\ninterquartile range. Two-sided Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney U tests\nwas used for comparisons, if not otherwise specified. For P values, ns,\nnot significant.\n\nThere were a number of chromosomal features that were not associated\nwith the producer cell proviral phenotype. Distance to transcriptional\nstart sites (TSSs) was statistically indistinguishable between producer,\nnon-producer and defective proviruses, regardless of the orientation of\nthe host gene and provirus (Extended Data Fig. 3b--d ). We also did not\ndetect any significant differences between producer, non-producer and\ndefective proviral classes and their distance to heterochromatic\ncentromeres or the fraction of integration into transcriptionally active\nspeckle-associated domains (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f ). Finally, using\nRNA-seq analysis from CD4 ^+^ T cells of participants with NSV, we\ndetected no significant differences in host gene transcript levels\nbetween producer, non-producer and defective proviruses regardless of\nthe integration orientation of the provirus with regard to the host gene\n(Extended Data Fig. 3g,h ).\n\n\n\n## Distinct cell survival and interferon signaling in NSV\n\nCell survival signaling has been linked to HIV-1 persistence, especially\nin latently infected CD4 ^+^ T cells ^42\\ ,\\ 43^ . To understand the\nassociation between cell signaling and NSV, we compared the CD4 ^+^ T\ncell transcriptomic features between the NSV group ( *N* = 8) and a\nsubgroup of the ART-suppressed individuals ( *N* = 5) with available RNA\nsequencing (RNA-seq) data ^44\\ ,\\ 45^ . Compared with the ART-suppressed\nindividuals, participants with NSV had 265 upregulated genes and 427\ndownregulated genes in total CD4 ^+^ T cells (adjusted *P* value ( *P*\n~adj~ ) \\<0.1, Fig. ​ Fig.4a). 4a ). Among these differentially expressed\ngenes (DEGs), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed enrichment of\npathways related to HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 life cycle and transcription\nin the NSV group (Fig. ​ (Fig.4b). 4b ). CD4 ^+^ T cells from the NSV\ngroup exhibited enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation and\napoptosis-related signals (Fig. ​ (Fig.4b 4b top and Extended Data Fig. ​\nFig.4a). 4a ). Specifically, CD4 ^+^ T cells from participants with NSV\nappeared to be primed for survival via downregulation of pro-apoptotic\ngenes and upregulation of genes associated with anti-apoptotic pathways,\nincluding proteosome-related genes (for example, *PSMB1* , *PSMB2* and\n*PSMD14* ), ubiquitination-related genes, and oncogenes such as *PIK3CA*\nand *PIK3R1* (Fig. 4c,d ) ^46\\ --\\ 49^ .\n\nFig. 4\n\n**Transcriptomic analysis of CD4 ^+^ T cells from participants with\nNSV.**\n\n**a** , Volcano plot shows DEGs in participants with NSV versus\nART-suppressed individuals.

Adjustments were made for multiple comparisons using the\nBenjamini-Hochberg method. (b) Two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test was used\nto evaluate interferon (IFN)-related gene expression levels between NSV\nand control groups. Bars represent median values. (c) Gene network\nrelated to IFN signaling enriched in the control group generated by\nSTRING analysis.\n\nTranscriptomic analysis also highlighted differences in the immune\nresponses between NSV and ART-suppressed individuals. Participants with\nNSV demonstrated upregulation of immunosuppression-related genes in\ntotal CD4 ^+^ T cells, including *CTLA4* and *FOXP3* (Fig. ​ (Fig.4a), 4a\n), pointing to an enrichment of the RUNX1-related pathway, which is\nassociated with attenuation in antiviral and interferon (IFN) signaling\nthrough FOXP3 binding ^50\\ ,\\ 51^ . In fact, both IFN-α/β and IFN-γ\nsignaling were enriched in ART-suppressed individuals (Fig. ​ (Fig.4b 4b\nbottom and Extended Data Fig. 4b,c ). IFN signaling plays a pivotal role\nin HIV-1 pathogenesis by inducing viral restriction factors, causing\ndepletion of CD4 ^+^ T cells, and regulating systemic immune activation\n^52^ . These results may point towards potential defects in\nimmune-mediated control of a highly active HIV-1 reservoir as a\ncontributing factor for NSV.\n\n\n\n## Absence of immune activation and evidence of HLA escape in NSV\n\nWe next assessed the impact of NSV on inflammation and immune\nactivation. Levels of 12 plasma soluble markers of inflammation were\ncompared between participants with NSV and ART-suppressed participants.\nParticipants with NSV demonstrated lower IL-10 and elevated IL-6, but no\nsignificant differences in levels of C-reactive protein, sCD14 and\nsCD163 compared with ART-suppressed individuals (Extended Data Fig. ​\nFig.5). 5 ). Of note, the older age of the participants with NSV could\nbe playing a role in the higher IL-6 levels found in the participants\nwith NSV compared with the ART-suppressed participants ^53^ . Levels of\nactivated HLA-DR ^+^ CD38 ^+^ CD4 ^+^ and CD8 ^+^ T cells were compared\namong participants with NSV, ART-suppressed participants and a cohort of\nhistorical VCs, who can achieve immune-mediated control of HIV-1\nreplication without ART ^54^ . Despite similar levels of viremia to the\nVCs (Extended Data Fig. ​ Fig.6a), 6a ), participants with NSV had\nsubstantially lower levels of CD8 ^+^ T cell activation compared with\nVCs and comparable levels compared with ART-suppressed individuals (Fig.\n​(Fig.5a). 5a ). There were no differences in the intensity and frequency\nof CD4-expressing cells between groups (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c ).\n\nFig. 5\n\n**HIV-specific CD8 ^+^ T cell response and HLA class I escape\nmutations.**\n\n**a** , Frequency of HLA-DR ^+^ CD38 ^+^ in CD4 ^+^ and CD8 ^+^ T cells.\n**b** , HIV-specific CD8 ^+^ T cell ELISPOT responses in NSV,\nART-suppressed, and viremic controller (VC) cohorts.

Two-sided Mann-Whitney U test was used.\n\nHIV-specific CD8 ^+^ T cells, which recognize viral peptides presented\nin complex with HLA Class-I (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C), are thought to be\none of the key mediators of viral control ^55\\ ,\\ 56^ . Among NSV,\nART-suppressed and VC participants, the magnitude of effector\nHLA-restricted HIV-specific T cell activity and proliferative\nHIV-specific CD8 ^+^ T cells aligned with overall CD8 ^+^ T cell\nactivation. VCs had significantly greater HIV-specific CD8 ^+^ T cell\nresponses by IFN-γ ELISpot and T cell proliferation assays in comparison\nwith both participants with NSV and ART-suppressed participants (Fig.\n5b,c ). In VCs, elevated HIV-specific CD8 ^+^ T cell responses were\ndetected against HIV-1 Gag, Pol, Env and Nef peptides, with the most\nrobust responses towards Gag (Extended Data Fig. ​ Fig.7). 7 ). Of note,\nthe relatively muted HIV-specific CD8 ^+^ T cell response in NSV was\npaired with a modestly higher average number of HLA-adapted (escape)\nmutations ^57^ in producer proviruses compared with non-producer ( *P*\n= 0.04) and a substantially higher escape burden compared with defective\nproviruses adjusted for proviral length ( *P* = 0.001, Fig. ​ Fig.5d). 5d\n). After normalizing for the size of each HIV-1 gene, *nef* showed\nsignificantly higher numbers of adapted and possible adapted mutations\ncompared with other HIV-1 genes (Fig. ​ (Fig.5e 5e and Extended Data Fig.\n​Fig.8). 8 ). Adapted and possible adapted mutations in HIV-1 genomes in\nboth producers and non-producers highly correlated with CD8 ^+^ T cell\nIFN-γ release but not with proliferation (Fig. 5f,g ), suggesting a\nrelationship between effector HIV-specific CD8 ^+^ T cell responses with\nrelatively decreased functionality (that is, proliferation) and\nsubsequent emergence of mutations within proviral clones. Specifically,\nthe number of *nef* adapted and possible adapted mutations in producer\nproviruses was strongly correlated with CD8 ^+^ T cell IFN-γ release in\nNSV ( *r* = 0.94, *P* = 0.02, Fig. 5f,h ). Adapted and possible adapted\nmutations in *pol* in producer proviruses also significantly correlated\nwith total CD8 ^+^ T cell activity ( *r* = 0.84, *P* = 0.04, Fig. ​\nFig.5i) 5i ) and may represent immune-driven viral escape mutations that\naccumulated before ART initiation.\n\nExtended Data Fig. 7\n\n**HIV-specific CD8 ^+^ T cell response among NSV, ART-suppressed, and\nviremic controller cohorts.**\n\nFor Gag-specific CD8 ^+^ T cell response, we had n = 4, n = 6 and n = 8\nresponses for NSV, ART-suppressed and VC samples, respectively. For\nPol-specific response, we had n = 1, n = 2 and n = 7 responses from NSV,\nART-suppressed and VC samples, respectively. For Env-specific response,\nwe had n = 2, n = 3 and n = 6 responses from NSV, ART-suppressed and VC\nsamples, respectively. For Nef-specific response, we had n = 3, n = 5\nand n = 6 responses from NSV, ART-suppressed and VC samples,\nrespectively.

Center lines in boxplots indicated median, box limits indicated\nupper and lower quartiles and the whiskers indicated minimal and maximal\nvalues. Friedman test was conducted within each gene area and Nemenyi\npost-hoc pair-wise tests were performed to evaluate the difference\nbetween two different proviral groups.\n\n\n\n## A subset of producers has deletions in the 5′ leader region\n\nOur sequencing revealed that NSV is largely composed of one or two\nclonal populations that remain stable over time, which is consistent\nwith high-level viral production from a large, clonally expanded\npopulation of HIV-1-infected cells as the primary driver of NSV, rather\nthan ongoing viral replication on ART. Since NSV need not be composed of\ninfectious virus, we evaluated producer proviruses for potential\nreplication defects, including deletions in the 5′ PSI packaging element\n^58^ . In 38% (3/8) of participants with NSV, we observed that producer\nproviruses harbored deletions in the 5′ end of HIV-1 genome (Extended\nData Fig. ​ Fig.9, 9 , black boxes). These deletions, which encompassed\n22, 15 and 41 nucleotides in participants LV4, LV7 and LV8,\nrespectively, all occurred within SL1 and SL2 elements, ending at the\nsame location within the splice donor site. Plasma HIV-1 RNA sequencing\nof the 5′ leader/ *gag* region of HIV-1 was performed to confirm the\npresence of these 5′ defects within the plasma HIV-1 RNA sequences. To\nevaluate whether these proviruses were infectious, viral outgrowth\nassays (VOAs) were performed using a transwell system with participant\nCD4 ^+^ T cells (LV4, LV7 and LV8; LV2, LV5 and LV9 served as controls)\nin the bottom chamber and MOLT-4/CCR5 cells in the upper chamber. HIV-1\nDNA from the MOLT-4 cells was extracted and subjected to MIP-seq\nanalysis. None of the proviruses with 5′ deletions was isolated in the\nVOA. Producer provirus was isolated from the VOA for LV9 (Fig. ​ (Fig.2a\n2a and Extended Data Fig. ​ Fig.10). 10 ). Non-producer proviruses were\nisolated from the VOA for LV2, LV5 and LV8 (Fig. ​ (Fig.2a 2a ) ^58^ .\n\nExtended Data Fig. 9\n\n**Location of deletions in the 5' leader sequence in three NSV\nparticipants.**\n\nDeletions are shown in the black regions at the bottom.

Our results\nindicate that suboptimal ART adherence and drug resistance do not appear\nto be the drivers of non-suppressible viremia. In these participants,\nour data suggest that NSV is driven instead by the critical intersection\nof viral and host immune factors. Specifically, the NSV phenotype was\nhighlighted by the presence of large, clonally expanded reservoirs of\nproviruses frequently harboring immune escape mutations (and/or defects\nin the 5′ leader region), integrated in transcriptionally permissive\nchromosomal regions, within CD4 ^+^ T cells primed for survival, and in\nan environment of muted HIV-specific T cell responses (Supplementary\nFig. 3 ).\n\nIn one of the first in-depth reservoir studies of NSVs, Halvas et al.\nreported that NSV is composed largely of identical populations of plasma\nviruses that arise from the expansion of HIV-infected CD4 ^+^ T cell\nclones, which they termed repliclones ^1^ . However, most prior studies\nsequenced relatively short fragments of viral RNA, which can\noverestimate the clonality of plasma sequences. Our plasma HIV-1 RNA\nsequencing assay was combined with an ultrasensitive RNA extraction\nprocess for 6.7 kb *pol-env* RNA-seq (Extended Data Fig. ​ Fig.10). 10 ).\nThese results confirm that, in our cohort, NSV is composed primarily of\none to two large plasma viral clones that composed \\>70% of plasma\nviruses. The role of these viral clones as the primary driver of NSV was\nconfirmed across multiple longitudinal time points, which failed to\nreveal evidence of plasma viral sequence changes and evolution. For all\nof the participants with NSV, we were able to identify exact proviral\nsequence matches for the large plasma clones. We found that the size of\nthe producer proviral reservoir was significantly larger than either the\nsize of the non-producer proviruses in participants with NSV or intact\nproviruses in ART-suppressed participants, although admittedly with a\nbroad distribution in size of the producer proviral reservoir. The large\nsize of these producer proviral reservoirs and their ability to maintain\nNSV over years highlight the relative stability of this reservoir. These\nresults and the presence of NSV over many years suggests an intrinsic\nability of these HIV-infected cells to maintain prolonged survival\nand/or proliferate. Prior studies have reported that CD4 ^+^ T cells\nmodulating key pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways can maintain survival of\nHIV-infected cells, drive clonal expansion and guard against CTLs\n^43\\ ,\\ 59^ . Compared with ART-suppressed participants, CD4 ^+^ T cells\nin participants with NSV demonstrated transcriptional upregulation of\nanti-apoptotic pathways and downregulation of pro-apoptotic pathways.\nWhile transcriptional analysis was not isolated to producer cells alone,\nthese results suggest that the CD4 ^+^ T cell environment in\nparticipants with NSV is primed for survival. Lymphoid clonal\nhematopoiesis (L-CH) refers to the expansion of hematopoietic stem cell\nclones in relation to age that is triggered by the acquisition of\nspecific point mutations or chromosomal alterations in somatic cells.\nRecent studies have revealed the presence of L-CH in conditions such as\nautoimmunity or immunodeficiency, and the role of L-CH in NSV should be\nstudied in the future ^60^ .\n\nUsing the MIP-seq assay ^39^ , we were able to identify the location of\nHIV-1 integration sites in host chromosomes for 11 producer, 21 intact\nnon-producer and 44 defective proviruses across participants with NSV.\nHIV-1 integration is known to favor active chromatin, and proximity to\nactivating epigenetic marks can modulate proviral gene expression and\nhence the fate of the resident provirus and infected cell ^61\\ ,\\ 62^ .\nWe and others have reported that with prolonged ART, intact proviruses\nare more likely to be found in non-genic regions, in opposite\norientation from the host gene and more distant from accessible\nchromosomal regions that highlight the selection of intact proviruses\nintegrated into regions of deep latency ^63^ . In participants with NSV,\nwe found enrichment of integration in chromosome 19, which is\ndistinctively enriched for gene density ^64\\ ,\\ 65^ . We also\ndemonstrated that producer proviruses were located in regions enriched\nin certain epigenetic characteristics, including a greater number of\nH3K36me3 histone peaks, which are associated with a transcriptionally\npermissive chromosomal regions and elevated proviral expression ^38^ . A\nhigher number of H3K36me3 peaks surrounding the producer provirus was\nalso strongly associated with higher plasma viral load composed of that\nclone. These results show that the location of HIV-1 proviral\nintegration in the host genome is a determinant of its eventual fate and\nalign with emerging evidence that the processes of entering and exiting\nproviral transcriptional latency are influenced by epigenetic\nmechanisms, making them potentially susceptible to pharmacological\ninterventions.\n\nWe found that the persistence of non-suppressible viremia occurred in an\nenvironment of relatively muted inflammation and immune activation,\nfeaturing the downregulation of IFN response genes, generally low levels\nof soluble inflammatory markers, and no significant increase in\nHIV-specific CD8 ^+^ T cell responses compared with ART-suppressed\nindividuals. IFN plays a vital role in the innate host antiviral\nresponse and contributes to the suppression of HIV-1 viremia ^66^ .\nCompared with ART-suppressed participants, participants with NSV\nsignificantly downregulated transcription of multiple genes involved in\nthe IFN-response pathway by bulk CD4 transcriptomic analysis. These\ninclude IFN regulatory factors 3 and 7 ( *IRF3* and *IRF7* ), *OAS1* and\nother genes known to be part of critical circuits for stimulating host\nantiviral immune responses ^67\\ ,\\ 68^ . While transcriptomic analysis\nwas performed only on bulk CD4 cells, the results do provide some\nintriguing signals related to latency reversal and cellular survival.\nFor example, BIRC2 is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), which\nsuppresses HIV-1 transcription and depletion of BIRC2 can lead to HIV-1\nlatency reversal ^69^ . Participants with NSV downregulated the\nexpression of TNFRSF14, the receptor for the LIGHT/TNFSF14 ligand, which\nbinds BIRC2 (ref. ^70^ ). Inhibitors of LIGHT/TNFSF14 are being\ndeveloped for cancer immunotherapy ^71^ and could be assessed for HIV-1\nlatency reversal potential. In addition, participants with NSV were\nfound to upregulate expression of PIK3R1 and PIK3CA (among other\nanti-apoptotic genes), which help encode phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase,\nan enzyme that promotes cellular survival through activation of Akt.\nWhether the use of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors could\ncontribute to clearing HIV-infected cells should also be explored\n^72\\ ,\\ 73^ .\n\nHeightened HIV-specific CD8 ^+^ T cell responses occur with HIV-1\nviremia, which is critical to suppress the HIV-1 reservoir ^74^ . Thus,\nwe were surprised to find a relatively muted CD8 ^+^ T cell response,\nwith no significant differences noted in HLA-restricted HIV-specific CD8\n^+^ T cell activity and proliferation between the individuals with NSV\nand ART-suppressed individuals, and significantly lower levels than seen\nin VCs with similar levels of viremia. Together, the transcriptomic,\nsoluble inflammatory and T cell data demonstrated that NSV appears to be\nuncoupled with immune activation. There are several possible\nexplanations for the relatively low levels of HIV-specific T cell\nresponses. First, producer proviruses harbored higher frequencies of\nadaptive HLA escape mutations, which may explain the suboptimal\ninduction of HIV-specific CD8 ^+^ T cell activity due to a loss of\nantigen recognition ^75^ . Of note, there was an enrichment of\nHLA-escape mutations in *nef* , which may be particularly immunogenic as\nprevious studies have reported that the strength of the Nef-specific T\ncell activity is linked with the size of the HIV-1 reservoir ^76^ .\nAnother potential mechanism of immune escape may be the contribution of\ndefective virions to NSV. In 38% (three of eight) of our individuals\nwith NSV, we detected deletions in the 5′ leader sequence of the HIV-1\ngenome. None of these sequences was recovered using the VOA, suggesting\nthese proviruses may be replication defective. The 5′-untranslated\nleader contains several structural motifs that are involved in multiple\nsteps of HIV-1 replication. The deletions are present in the psi (Ψ)\nelement, which is a highly structured RNA sequence with four hairpin\nstem loops and a strong affinity for the nucleocapsid domain of the\nviral Gag protein. Genome packaging during virus assembly and reverse\ntranscription during the subsequent round of infection are some known\nfunctions of the 5′ leader region ^77\\ ,\\ 78^ . A recent study by White\net al. described four participants with NSV with apparent defects in the\n5′ leader sequence ^58^ . These defects generally spanned the major\nsplice donor site and resulted in the creation of nonfunctional virions\nlacking the envelope glycoprotein. Interestingly, the 5′ leader sequence\ndeletions in our participants with NSV spanned the same region and, in\nfact, LV4 shares the same 22-base deletion that was detected in three\nparticipants by White et al. The detection of 5′ leader defects at high\nfrequencies across multiple cohorts suggests a selective advantage of\nthese proviruses in conferring the NSV phenotype, potentially by\nmaintaining a plasma viral load in the absence of HIV-1 replication\nand/or the ability of Env-deleted virions to escape from host immune\nsurveillance ^79^ . It has also become increasingly clear that cellular\nmetabolism represents a crucial regulator of T cell activation and\nresponse. Additional studies are also needed to assess the role of\nmetabolic programs and pathways, such as altered glutaminolysis and\nglycolysis, in suppressing T cell function in participants with NSV ^80^\n.\n\nIn addition to the previously noted limitations, the small size of the\nNSV cohort analyzed in this study is a key limitation. Also, we\nestimated proviral reservoir size by near-full-length proviral\nsequencing. This could lead to some underestimation of the actual\nreservoir size, although other methods for reservoir quantification (for\nexample, intact proviral DNA assay) may overestimate the size ^81^ .\nFuture studies will need to investigate the size of producer proviruses\nwithin tissue reservoirs. We found that the peripheral blood reservoir\nof HIV-infected CD4 ^+^ T cells contributing to NSV can differ\ndramatically between participants with NSV. It is possible that\nNSV-generating CD4 ^+^ T cells are also distributed within anatomical\ntissue compartments ^82\\ ,\\ 83^ , especially for those participants with\nNSV with a relatively small producer proviral reservoir size in the\nperipheral blood. Prior studies have shown that Gag- or CMV-specific\nantigens can drive the expansion of certain HIV-infected cellular clones\n^32^ . Additional studies are needed to delineate which antigens might\nbe playing a role in the expansion of the producer proviruses.\nNeutralizing antibody responses can also suppress viremia ^84^ and\nevaluation of the humoral immune responses are indicated, although prior\nstudies suggest that some NSV is resistant to autologous neutralizing\nantibodies ^85^ . The lack of viral evolution and ongoing viral\nreplication on longitudinal phylogenetic analysis may explain why ART\nintensification has not led to virologic efficacy in those with NSV. It\nis unknown whether newer ARVs, including drugs with potential\nimmunomodulatory properties (for example, fostemsavir ^86^ ) could\nprovide additional virologic benefit.\n\nIn this study, we identified critical host and viral mediators of NSV\nthat represent potential targets to disrupt HIV-1 persistence and\npromote viral silencing. Importantly, ultrasensitive HIV-1 viral load\nassays can detect residual low levels of HIV-1 viremia in the vast\nmajority of PWH, even on apparently suppressive ART ^87^ . Previous\nstudies have reported that such residual viremia is largely composed of\ndrug-sensitive virus ^16^ and relatively homogeneous viral populations\n^18^ . Thus, we believe it is likely that the mechanisms behind NSV that\nwe describe here are present to some extent in most, if not all, of PWH.\nAchieving an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms behind NSV may\nprovide insight on strategies for HIV-1 reservoir eradication applicable\nto all PWH.\n\n\n\n## Methods\n\n### Participants\n\nIn an observational study, we enrolled 8 ART-treated participants with\nthree or more HIV-1 RNA levels between 40 and 1,000 copies ml ^−1^ over\n24 months of whom 7 (88%) were men and compared them with a historic\ncohort of 11 ART-suppressed participants, of whom 5 (71%) were men, with\nHIV-1 with similar demographic and CD4 counts. Sex and/or gender of\nparticipants was determined on the basis of self-report. A participant\nwith non-suppressible viremia enrolled in the HIV Eradication and\nLatency (HEAL) cohort, a biorepository of Brigham and Women's Hospital,\nwas included as a part of eight NSVs. The NSV samples were taken from\ndifferent time points, enabling us to study these participants\nlongitudinally (Fig. ​ (Fig.1 1 and Extended Data Fig. ​ Fig.1). 1 ). The\nART-suppressed comparators included 11 participants from the AIDS\nClinical Trials Group (ACTG) and 7 participants from the Ragon Institute\nof Massachusetts General Hospital, the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology and Harvard. Both ART-suppressed comparator groups were well\nmatched with the participants with NSV by CD4 count. A cohort of VCs not\non ART with similar viral loads to the participants with NSV was also\nincluded for the T cell analysis. All study participants provided\nwritten informed consent. The study was approved by the Mass General\nBrigham Institutional Review Board.\n\n### ARV drug level testing\n\nFor plasma ARV testing, samples were sent to the infectious disease\npharmacokinetics lab at the University of Florida. Testing was performed\nfor darunavir and dolutegravir by liquid chromatography with tandem mass\nspectrometry. For DBS ARV testing, 25 ml of whole blood were spotted\nfive times onto Whatman 903 protein saver cards, as previously described\n^21\\ ,\\ 82^ . After spotting, cards were allowed to dry at room\ntemperature for at least 3 h (as long as overnight), after which they\nwere stored at −80 °C until analyzed. TFV-DP and FTC-TP were quantified\nfrom two 7-mm punches extracted with 2 ml of methanol:water to create a\nlysed cellular matrix using a previously validated method that was\nadapted and validated for tenofovir alafenamide-containing regimens. The\nassay was linear and ranged from 25 to 6,000 fmol per sample for TFV-DP\nand from 0.1 to 200 pmol per sample for FTC-TP ^21\\ ,\\ 88^ .\n\n### DNA isolation and HIV reservoir quantification\n\nDNA extractions were carried out from PBMCs using the QIAamp DNA Micro\nKit (cat. no. 56304), and the quantification of DNA was performed with\nNanodrop (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher). To estimate the size of\nthe reservoir, we analyzed near-full-length proviral sequences as\ndescribed below.\n\n### Near-full-length proviral sequencing, sequence alignments, quality control and neighbor joining analyses\n\nExtracted DNA was endpoint-diluted and subjected to near full-length\nsequencing (NFL-seq), as previously described ^63^ . We classified our\nsequences into intact and different classes of defective proviruses (for\nexample, 5′-defect, deletion, hypermutation and inversion) using a\npublished proviral intactness pipeline ^88^ . Briefly, after aligning to\nHXB2, we called our sequences as large deleterious deletions if they had\na \\<8,000-bp amplicon size, out-of-frame indels, premature/lethal stop\ncodons, internal inversions or packaging signal deletions (≥15 bp). The\nLos Alamos National Laboratory HIV Sequence Database Hypermut 2 program\nwas used to identify the existence or nonexistence of hypermutations\nlinked to APOBEC-3G/3F. Sequences of the virus that did not have any of\nthe mutations listed earlier were categorized as 'genome-intact'\nsequences. Using MAFFT v7.2.0, we aligned the sequences and utilized\nMEGA 6 to deduce neighbor joining trees. We called those proviruses with\nan exact match with plasma sequences 'producers' and intact proviruses\nwithout matching plasma sequences 'non-producers'.\n\n### Plasma HIV-1 RNA sequencing\n\nWe sequenced plasma HIV RNA as previously described. ^89^ Extracted RNA\nwas diluted to single viral genome levels to meet the criteria of\nsingle-genome sequencing of having no more than one template in each\nwell, theoretically no more than 25% of wells being positive for HIV.\nPrimers were designed to amplify *pol-env* , a 6.7-kb region\n(Supplementary Data 1 ). The amplification reaction was performed using\n0.5 µl primers (10 µmol), 1 µl (10 mmol) MgSO ~4~ , 1 µl (10 mmol) dNTPs\nand 1 U Platinum Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen) in 25 µl total volume.\nPolymerase chain reaction conditions consisted of a denaturation step at\n94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 56 °C,\n90 s at 68 °C and 10 min at 68 °C. Products underwent Illumina barcoded\nlibrary construction and MiSeq sequencing. Amplicons were assembled\nusing the UltraCycler v1.0 automated de novo sequence assembly to\ngenerate a continuous fragment. Plasma sequences that were within one to\ntwo nucleotides of the near-full-length proviral sequence was considered\npart of the clonal cluster. We counted the total number of plasma\nsequences in each clone and divided them by all plasma sequences that we\nhad generated. Then we multiplied the ratio with the plasma viral load\nto determine the contribution of each clone for plasma viral load, which\nwe termed the plasma clone viral load.\n\nFor each sequence, the GSS versus the participants' ART regimen was\ncalculated using the Stanford HIV database drug resistance scoring\nsystem. The Stanford HIV database provides a weighted penalty score for\nthe effect of every resistance mutation and antiretroviral medication\nwith 0 if there is no expected effect to 60 for high-level resistance.\nFor each sequence, the estimated level of resistance for each\nantiretroviral medication (ARV) was determined by adding all of the\npenalty scores for each of the drug resistance mutations present. The\nGSS of each ARV was defined as the following: 1 (Stanford penalty score\n0--9), 0.75 (Stanford penalty score 10--14), 0.5 (Stanford penalty score\n15--29), 0.25 (Stanford penalty score 30--59) and 0 (Stanford penalty\nscore ≥60). The GSS for the sequence was the sum of the GSS for each ARV\nas part of the participant's regimen.\n\n### Total RNA transcripts sequencing\n\nCD4 ^+^ T cells were selected from cryopreserved PBMCs using EasySep\nHuman CD4 ^+^ T Cell Enrichment Kit (STEMCELL Technologies). RNA was\nextracted from selected CD4 ^+^ T cells with the AllPrep DNA/RNA kit\n(Qiagen) with subsequent ribosomal RNA depletion RNA reverse transcribed\nto complementary DNA library and sequenced by NovaSeq (Illumina).\nSequencing results were processed with the VIPER pipeline for alignment,\ncounting and quality control ^90^ . DEG analysis was performed with\nDESeq2 package ^89^ and GSEA with fgsea package using the adaptive\nmultilevel splitting Monte Carlo approach ( *n* = 10,000 for simple\nfgsea in preliminary estimation of *P* values) ^91^ .\n\n### Integration site identification and epigenetics\n\nWe characterized single proviral genomes along with their matched\ngenomic integration sites by MIP-seq ^39^ . Briefly, we initiated\nwhole-genome amplification by performing multiple displacement\namplification with phi29 polymerase using the QIAGEN REPLI-g Single Cell\nKit, following the manufacturer's protocol. Afterward, we divided DNA\nfrom each sample and carried out proviral sequencing and integration\nsite analysis. We utilized integration site loop amplification, which\nhas been previously described, to obtain the integration sites\nassociated with each viral sequence ^92^ . One modification that we made\nto this assay is targeting both the 5′ and 3′ ends of HIV to assess the\nintegration site on both ends and eliminate any potential bias that may\narise from analyzing only one end of HIV. To determine the exact\nlocation of HIV in the host gene, we used an online tool for trimming\nintegration sites ^93\\ ,\\ 94^ . We analyzed our integration sites for\nvarious histone marks by utilizing ChIP--seq datasets from primary CD4\n^+^ T cells that were publicly available on the ROADMAP website ^40^ .\nThe NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium produces a public\nresource of human epigenomic data to catalyze basic biology and\ndisease-oriented research ( http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/ ). We\ncalculated the total number of peaks of histone marks in a 10-kb window\nfrom the flanking sides of the integration site and regarded it as the\ntotal peak number. To determine the distance between the IS and the\nnearest TSS, we employed 'nearestTSS: Find Nearest Transcriptional Start\nSite', which is a tool developed in included in the edgeR package ^95^ .\n\n### Inflammatory soluble marker levels\n\nCryopreserved plasma samples were thawed and analyzed in batch to assess\ninflammatory cytokines. Assays were run on 96-well plates. Duplicates\nwere performed for 25% of the samples that were run on each plate.\nMesoscale Discovery single and multiplex assays were performed according\nto instructions provided in kits for assessment of sCD14 (F21T1-2),\nsCD163 (F21J4-3), TNF-RI (R210V-3), TNF-RII (F21ZS-3), IFN-γ, IL-6,\nIL-10, IP-10, C-reactive protein (K151A9H-1) and TGF-β1-3 (K15241K-1).\nD-dimer levels were measured with a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay (Diagnostica Stago S.A.S.). The Mesoscale assays were analyzed\nwith a MESO QuickPlex SQ 120MM Reader.\n\n### T cell activation phenotyping and assessment of surface CD4 ^+^ expression\n\nPBMCs were thawed and stained with Live/Dead Violet (Thermo Fisher,\n1:1,000), PE-Cy7-CD3 (clone SK7, BioLegend, 1:100), BV711-anti-CD4\n(clone RPA-T4, BioLegend, 1:100), APC-anti-CD8 (clone SK1, BioLegend,\n1:100), Alexa Fluor 700-anti-CD25 (clone M-A251, BioLegend, 1:50),\nBV650-anti-CD38 (clone HB-7, BioLegend, 1:50), FITC-anti-CD69 (FN50,\nBioLegend, 1:50), BV785-anti-HLA-DR (clone L243, BioLegend, 1:50) and\nPE/Dazzle 594-anti-PD-1 (clone EH12.2H7, BioLegend, 1:100). Cells were\nwashed and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde before flow cytometric analysis\non a BD LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences). CD4 surface expression was\ndetermined by assessment of CD4 mean fluorescence intensity.\n\n### Assessment of HIV-specific CD8 ^+^ T cell reactivity\n\nPBMCs were resuspended at 1 × 10 ^6^ ml ^−1^ in RPMI supplemented with\n10% fetal bovine serum (R10) and plated 200 µl per well in Immobilon-P\n96-well microtiter plates (Millipore) precoated with 2 µg ml ^−1^\nanti-IFN-γ (clone DK1, Mabtech). Individual HLA-restricted HIV peptides\nfrom the optimal A-list ^96^ matched to each subject's HLA genotype were\nadded at 1 µg ml ^−1^ and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Negative control\nwells did not receive peptide and positive control wells were treated\nwith 1 µg ml ^−1^ anti-CD3 (clone OKT3, BioLegend) and 1 µg ml ^−1^\nanti-CD28 (clone CD28.8, BioLegend) antibodies. ELISPOT assay was\nperformed using manufacturer's protocol with anti-IFN-γ (clone 1-DK1,\nMabtech) capture, biotinylated anti-IFN-γ (clone B6-1, Mabtech)\ndetection, Streptavidin-ALP (Mabtech) and AP Conjugated Substrate\n(Bio-Rad) followed by disinfection with 0.05% Tween-20 (Thermo Fisher)\nand analysis using S6 Macro Analyzer (CTL Analyzers). Responses greater\nthan ten spots per well and 3-fold above negative controls were scored\nas positive ^97\\ ,\\ 96^ .\n\n### Assessment of HIV-specific CD8 ^+^ T cell proliferation\n\nPBMCs were stained at 37 °C for 20 min with 0.5 µM CellTrace\ncarboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Thermo Fisher) as per\nmanufacturer's protocol at 1 × 10 ^6^ cells ml ^−1^ . Staining was\nquenched with fetal bovine serum (Sigma), and cells were washed twice\nwith R10, resuspended at 1 × 10 ^6^ ml ^−1^ and plated 200 µl per well\nin 96-well round-bottom polystyrene plates (Corning). Individual HIV\npeptides corresponding to IFN-γ ELISPOT responses for each participant\nwere added at 1 µg ml ^−1^ and incubated at 37 °C for 6 days before flow\ncytometric assessment. Negative control wells received dimethyl\nsulfoxide (in amounts equivalent to peptide containing wells), but no\npeptide. Positive control wells received 1 µg ml ^−1^ anti-CD3 (clone\nOKT3, BioLegend) and anti-CD28 (clone CD28.8, BioLegend) antibodies. On\nday 6, cells were stained with Live/Dead Violet (Thermo Fisher),\nPE/Cy7-anti-human CD3 (clone SK7, BioLegend) and APC-anti-human CD8\n(clone SK1, BioLegend) and then analyzed by flow cytometry\n(Supplementary Fig. 4 ). The frequency of proliferating CD8 ^+^ T cells\nwas determined by subtracting the percentage of CD8 ^+^ T cells in the\nCFSE low gate following HIV peptide stimulation by the highest\npercentage of CFSE low cells among the dimethyl sulfoxide negative\ncontrols.\n\n### HLA typing and HIV escape mutation data analysis\n\nHLA-A/B/C typing was performed using sequence-specific oligonucleotide\nprobing and sequence-based typing as previously described ^98^ . We\nexcised individual HIV genes from proviral sequences using Gene Cutter\n^106^ . We then identified polymorphisms within these genes that are\nknown to be associated with one or more host HLA alleles expressed, as\ndefined using a published list of HLA-associated polymorphisms across\nthe HIV subtype B proteome ^99^ . For the escape mutation analysis, each\nHLA-associated viral site was categorized into one of three groups: (1)\n'non-adapted' viral sites showed the specific HIV-1 residue predicted to\nbe susceptible to the restricting HLA, (2) 'adapted' sites showed the\nspecific HIV-1 residue predicted to confer escape from the restricting\nHLA, and (3) 'possibly adapted' sites showed any residue other than the\n'non-adapted' form, supporting it as a possible escape variant ^100^ .\n\n### Limiting dilution VOA\n\nPBMCs from participants and donors without HIV were stimulated with IL-2\n(100 U ml ^−1^ ) and PHA (1 µg ml ^−1^ ) for 72 h in R20 culture media.\nThen, we continued the stimulation with only with IL-2 in R20 culture\nmedia. VOAs were performed by using CD4 ^+^ T cells isolated from\ncryopreserved PBMCs using EasySep Human CD4 ^+^ T Cell Enrichment Kit\n(STEMCELL Technologies) from participants and healthy donors. Then we\nused MOLT-4/CCR5 cell lines and co-cultured those for more than 30 days,\nas reported previously ^101^ . We started with 0.1 × 10 ^6^ MOLT-4/CCR5\ncells and 0.5 × 10 ^6^ CD4 ^+^ T cells from our participants and healthy\ndonor and cultured them in each well of a 24-Transwell plates (STEMCELL\nTechnologies). We collected samples from supernatant and MOLT-4/CCR5\nevery 3 days and refreshed the media with IL-2 (100 U ml ^−1^ ) in R20\n^102\\ ,\\ 103^ .\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nWe analyzed our results by using Mann--Whitney *U* tests (two-tailed),\nFisher's exact tests and Wilcoxon's tests as appropriate, unless\notherwise specified. Correlations were tested by the Spearman's rank\ntest. Adjustment for multiple comparisons was made in the analysis of\nChIP--seq histone marks and host gene transcription, RNA-seq and numbers\nof HLA escape mutations per HIV-1 gene. A *P* value of less than 0.05\nwas deemed significant. We adjusted for multiple comparisons in the\nanalysis of ChIP--seq histone marks and host gene transcription, RNA-seq\nand the number of HLA escape mutations per HIV-1 gene. However, we did\nnot make any corrections for multiple comparisons in the other analyses,\nas it was an exploratory analysis. We performed the statistical analysis\nusing Prism (GraphPad v.7) and the statistical packages in R (R Project\nfor Statistical Computing, version 4.1.0).\n\n## Data availability\n\nAll data and code are available by request to the authors and the AIDS\nClinical Trials Group.

To address this issue, we compared the latent viruses obtained from CD4 ^+^ T cells in peripheral blood and lymph nodes to viruses emerging during treatment interruption. Latent viruses were characterized by sequencing near-full-length (NFL) proviral DNA and env from viral outgrowth assays (VOAs). Five HIV-1-infected individuals on ART were studied, four of whom participated in a clinical trial of a TLR9 agonist that included an analytical treatment interruption. We found that 98% of intact or replication-competent clonal sequences overlapped between blood and lymph node. In contrast, there was no overlap between 205 latent reservoir and 125 rebound sequences in the four individuals who underwent treatment interruption. However, rebound viruses could be accounted for by recombination. The data suggest that CD4 ^+^ T cells carrying latent viruses circulate between blood and lymphoid tissues in individuals on ART and support the idea that recombination may play a role in the emergence of rebound viremia.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the characterization of latent HIV-1 proviruses and their role in viral rebound, but it does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 30420517\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Relationship between intact HIV-1 proviruses in circulating CD4 ^+^ T cells and rebound viruses emerging during treatment interruption\nAbstract\nCombination antiretroviral therapy controls but does not cure HIV-1 infection because a small fraction of cells harbor latent viruses that can produce rebound viremia when therapy is interrupted. The circulating latent virus reservoir has been documented by a variety of methods, most prominently by viral outgrowth assays (VOAs) in which CD4 ^+^ T cells are activated to produce virus in vitro, or more recently by amplifying proviral near full-length (NFL) sequences from DNA. Analysis of samples obtained in clinical studies in which individuals underwent analytical treatment interruption (ATI), showed little if any overlap between circulating latent viruses obtained from outgrowth cultures and rebound viruses from plasma. To determine whether intact proviruses amplified from DNA are more closely related to rebound viruses than those obtained from VOAs, we assayed 12 individuals who underwent ATI after infusion of a combination of two monoclonal anti--HIV-1 antibodies. A total of 435 intact proviruses obtained by NFL sequencing were compared with 650 latent viruses from VOAs and 246 plasma rebound viruses. Although, intact NFL and outgrowth culture sequences showed similar levels of stability and diversity with 39% overlap, the size of the reservoir estimated from NFL sequencing was larger than and did not correlate with VOAs. Finally, intact proviruses documented by NFL sequencing showed no sequence overlap with rebound viruses; however, they appear to contribute to recombinant viruses found in plasma during rebound.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility data. It focuses on the sequencing and analysis of HIV-1 proviruses and rebound viruses from patient samples, but there is no discussion of drug susceptibility testing.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 36074794\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Measuring the latent reservoir for HIV-1: Quantification bias in near full-length genome sequencing methods\nAbstract\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART) effectively inhibits HIV-1 replication but is not curative due to the persistence of a latent viral reservoir in resting CD4 ^+^ T cells. This reservoir is a major barrier to cure. Sequencing studies have revealed that the population of proviruses persisting in ART-treated individuals is dominated by defective proviruses that cannot give rise to viral rebound due to fatal defects including large deletions and APOBEC3-mediated hypermutation. Near full genome sequencing (nFGS) of individual proviruses is used in reservoir assays to provide an estimate of the fraction of proviruses that are intact. nFGS methods rely on a long-distance outer PCR capturing most (~9 kb) of the genome, followed by nested inner PCRs. The outer PCR is carried out at limit dilution, and interpretation of the results is based on the assumption that all proviruses are quantitatively captured. Here, we evaluate nFGS methods using the intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA), a multiplex digital droplet PCR assay that quantitates intact and defective proviruses with single molecule sensitivity using only short, highly efficient amplicons. We analyzed proviral templates of known sequence to avoid the additional complication of sequence polymorphism. With the IPDA, we quantitated molecular yields at each step of nFGS methods. We demonstrate that nFGS methods are inefficient and miss ~70% of full-length proviruses due to amplification failure at the initial outer PCR step. In contrast, proviruses with large internal deletions encompassing 70% of the genome can be quantitatively amplified under the same conditions. Accurate measurement of the latent reservoir of HIV-1 is essential for evaluating the efficacy of cure strategies, and the bias against full length proviruses in nFGS methods must be considered.\n\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the quantification and sequencing of HIV-1 proviruses, particularly in the context of evaluating near full-length genome sequencing methods. There is no mention of in vitro drug susceptibility data.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 38376918\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"The HIV-1 reservoir landscape in persistent elite controllers and transient elite controllers\nAbstract\nMETHODS\nThe characterization of HIV-1 reservoir from peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed using next-generation sequencing techniques, such as full-length individual and matched integration site proviral sequencing (FLIP-Seq; MIP-Seq).\nRESULTS\nPCs and TCs, before losing virological control, presented significantly lower total, intact, and defective proviruses compared with those of participants on antiretroviral therapy (ART). No differences were found in total and defective proviruses between PCs and TCs. However, intact provirus levels were lower in PCs compared with TCs; indeed the intact/defective HIV-DNA ratio was significantly higher in TCs. Clonally expanded intact proviruses were found only in PCs and located in centromeric satellite DNA or zinc-finger genes, both associated with heterochromatin features. In contrast, sampled intact proviruses were located in permissive genic euchromatic positions in TCs.\nRationale: The paper focuses on the characterization of the HIV-1 reservoir in persistent and transient elite controllers, including the analysis of proviral sequences and integration sites.

To address this issue, we conducted a cross-sectional/inter-participant genetic characterization of HIV-1 RNA from pre- and on-therapy plasmas and HIV-1 DNA from CD4 ^+^ T cell subsets derived from peripheral blood (PB), lymph node (LN), and gut tissues of 26 participants after 3 to 17.8 years of ART. Our studies revealed in four acute/early participants who had paired PB and LN samples a substantial reduction in the proportion of HIV-infected cells per year on therapy within the LN. Extrapolation to all 12 acute/early participants estimated a much smaller reduction in the proportion of HIV-1-infected cells within LNs per year on therapy that was similar to that in the participants treated during chronic infection. LN-derived effector memory T (T ~EM~ ) cells contained HIV-1 DNA that was genetically identical to viral sequences derived from pre- and on-therapy plasma samples. The proportion of identical HIV-1 DNA sequences increased within PB-derived T ~EM~ cells. However, the infection frequency of T ~EM~ cells in PB was stable, indicating that cellular proliferation that compensates for T cell loss over time contributes to HIV-1 persistence. This study suggests that ART reduces HIV-infected T cells and that clonal expansion of HIV-infected cells maintains viral persistence. Importantly, LN-derived T ~EM~ cells are a probable source of HIV-1 genomes capable of producing infectious HIV-1 and should be targeted by future curative strategies.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the genetic characterization of HIV-1 RNA and DNA from patient samples and does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing or data.\nAnswer: No"}

We describe injection schedule adherence and virologic\neffectiveness of CAB + RPV LA in routine clinical care in the US.\n\n### Methods\n\nFrom the OPERA ^®^ cohort, all adults with HIV who received their first\nCAB + RPV LA injection and ≥ 1 continuation injections between 21\nJanuary 2021 and 15 March 2022 were included. The injection target date\nwas updated monthly and set to the same date of the month as the\nprevious injection. Continuation injections administered within 7 days\nbefore or after the target date were considered on time, as per the\nlabel. Virologic undetectability (viral load \\< 50 copies/mL),\nsuppression (viral load \\< 200 copies/mL), and confirmed virologic\nfailure (2 consecutive viral loads ≥ 200 copies/mL or 1 viral load ≥ 200\ncopies/mL followed by discontinuation) were described among individuals\nwith a viral load \\< 50 copies/mL at initiation and ≥ 1 follow-up viral\nload.\n\n### Results\n\nAmong 321 individuals on CAB + RPV LA, 90% of the continuation\ninjections were administered on time (within ± 7 days of the target\ndate). Of the 237 individuals with a viral load \\< 50 copies/mL at\ninitiation and ≥ 1 follow-up viral load, nearly all were undetectable\n(95%) or suppressed (99%) at their last viral load measurement, 96%\nmaintained virologic suppression with all measured viral loads \\< 200\ncopies/mL, and four confirmed virologic failures were observed.\nInjection delays were infrequent, and did not affect virologic outcomes\nover the short term.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn this large US cohort, most monthly CAB + RPV LA injections were\nadministered on time and high levels of virologic control were achieved.\nThese results suggest that CAB + RPB LA injectable can be administered\neffectively during routine clinical care.\n\n\n## Methods\n\nThis study was conducted with data from the Observational\nPharmaco-Epidemiology Research & Analysis (OPERA ^®^ ) cohort, which\nconsists of prospectively captured, routine clinical data from\nelectronic health records from 84 clinics in 18 US states and\nterritories. OPERA complies with all HIPAA and HITECH requirements,\nwhich expand upon the ethical principles detailed in the 1964\nDeclaration of Helsinki. OPERA has received annual institutional review\nboard (IRB) approval by Advarra IRB, including a waiver of informed\nconsent and authorization for use of protected health information\n(Pro00023648). The study population included all people with HIV aged\n18 years or older who received their first CAB + RPV LA injection\nbetween 21 January 2021 and 28 February 2022, and at least one\ncontinuation injection by 15 March 2022.\n\nFor analysis purposes, the target date for CAB + RPV LA continuation\ninjections was updated monthly and set to the same date of the month as\nthe previous injection. Continuation injections administered within\n7 days before or after the target date were considered on time, those\nadministered \\> 7 days prior to the target date were considered early,\nand those administered \\> 7 days after the target date were considered\ndelayed. Factors associated with delayed injections were assessed using\nmultivariate logistic regression.\n\nVirologic outcomes were described among individuals with viral\nload \\< 50 copies/mL at initiation and at least one follow-up viral\nload. Virologic undetectability (i.e., viral load \\< 50 copies/mL) and\nsuppression (i.e., viral load \\< 200 copies/mL) were assessed at the\nlast viral load. Maintenance of virologic suppression was achieved if\nall follow-up viral loads remained \\< 200 copies/mL. Confirmed virologic\nfailure was defined as either two consecutive follow-up viral\nloads ≥ 200 copies/mL, or one follow-up viral load ≥ 200 copies/mL\nfollowed by discontinuation of CAB + RPV LA injectable.\n\n## Results\n\nA total of 321 individuals received at least one continuation CAB + RPV\nLA injection during the study period. The study included 16% women, 37%\nBlack, and 28% Hispanic PWH; 28% had a body mass index (BMI) \\> 30 kg/m\n^2^ . CAB + RPV LA initiation occurred a median of 7.2 years after HIV\ndiagnosis (IQR: 3.6, 14.2). At the time of the first injection, most had\na CD4 cell count ≥ 500 cells/μL (69%) and a viral load \\< 50 copies/mL\n(86%). Demographic and clinical characteristics stratified by viral load\nat initiation are presented in Table ​ Table1 1 .\n\nOverall, a total of 1152 continuation injections were administered over\n13 months, with a median of 3 continuation injections per person (IQR:\n2, 5). While 23% of individuals experienced at least one delay, few had\nmore than one delayed injection (Table ​ (Table2). 2 ). Moreover, 90% of\nall continuation injections were administered on time (i.e., within\n7 days before or after the target date) and 1% were administered early\n(Fig. 1 ). No pattern emerged when the proportion of on-time or early\ninjections was assessed over calendar time (not shown). Similarly, the\nproportion of on-time or early injections remained constant across\ncontinuation injections (i.e., first, second, third, \\[...\\], tenth; not\nshown). In a multivariate analysis, the only factor associated with the\noccurrence of a delayed injection was a history of AIDS-defining events,\nwhich was associated with over three times the likelihood of\nexperiencing a delayed injection (adjusted OR: 3.10; 95% CI: 1.54, 6.22)\ncompared to those without such history (Table ​ (Table3 3 ).\n\nVirologic outcomes were assessed among 221 individuals with a viral\nload \\< 50 copies/mL at initiation and ≥ 1 follow-up viral load. Most\nwere undetectable (95%) or suppressed (99%) at their last viral load\nmeasurement. Virologic suppression was maintained throughout follow-up\nin 96% of individuals. Four confirmed virologic failures were observed\nover a range of 6--36 weeks after the first injections, three of which\nresulted in CAB + RPV LA discontinuation; resistance data were not\navailable. No difference in virologic outcomes were observed between\nindividuals who experienced delays and those who did not (Table ​\n(Table4). 4 ). Data on oral bridging were not available. Of the 36\nindividuals with a viral load ≥ 200 copies/mL at initiation and ≥ 1\nfollow-up viral load, 94% had a viral load \\< 200 copies/mL at their\nlast measurement (not shown).\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn routine clinical care in the US, 90% of monthly CAB + RPV LA\ncontinuation injections were administered on time, or within 7 days\nbefore or after the target date, as per the label. Virologic suppression\nwas maintained throughout follow-up by 96% of individuals with a viral\nload \\< 50 copies/mL at initiation. Of note, confirmed virologic\nfailures were infrequent.\n\nThe virologic efficacy of monthly CAB + RPV LA injectable was\ndemonstrated in clinical trials \\[ 4 -- 12 \\]. In an observational study\nof 39 individuals with at least two continuation CAB + RPV injections,\nviral suppression was maintained by all 24 individuals with viral\nload \\< 30 copies/mL at initiation, and achieved by 12 (80%) of the 15\nindividuals with viral load ≥ 30 copies/mL at initiation \\[ 14 \\]. Among\nindividuals receiving CAB + RPV LA through a compassionate use program,\n6/7 (86%) individuals with a viral load \\< 50 copies/mL maintained\nsuppression, and 16/28 (57%) with a viral load ≥ 50 copies/mL achieved\nsuppression \\[ 16 \\].\n\nThe timely administration of long-acting medications such as CAB + RPV\nLA injectable is crucial to their success. In OPERA, 90% of continuation\ninjections were administered on time, and only a history of\nAIDS-defining events was associated with an increased risk of\nexperiencing a delay. Oral bridging should be used to maintain the\ntherapeutic dose when missed injections are planned or when delays\nranging from \\> 7 days to ≤ 8 weeks occur. Some of the delays observed\nin this study may not represent true gaps in treatment if oral bridging\nwas used but not documented. In this study, 60% of delayed injections\nwere administered within 28 days of the target date. However,\ndocumentation of oral bridging in the electronic health records was\ninconsistent and often missing. Moreover, bridging regimens and\nprescriptions are not uniform: some providers chose to maintain the\nprior ART prescription, some wrote a new prescription at CAB + RPV LA\nstart, and a few wrote a new prescription before a gap that corresponded\nwith the duration and timing of bridging medication use. Importantly, a\npopulation pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation study concluded that\nCAB LA injections could be resumed when injections had been delayed for\nless than 4 weeks after the target date, with or without oral bridging\n\\[ 17 \\]. Similar proportions of suppression and confirmed virologic\nfailures were observed in the minority of individuals with delays\ncompared to the majority without any delays. Nonetheless, proper\nadherence to CAB + RPV LA regimen is critical and health care providers\nshould emphasize this with individuals under their care.\n\nWhile CAB + RPV LA has been approved for virologically suppressed\nindividuals only, 13% of initiators in OPERA had a viral load ≥ 50\ncopies/mL at first injection. The OPERA cohort is comprised of EHR data\nfrom routine clinical care in the US, and, thus, off-label use may be\nobserved when such use is deemed appropriate by the healthcare provider.\nHowever, reasons for regimen selection are not consistently recorded in\nEHRs, so justifications for off-label CAB + RPV LA use could not be\ninvestigated.\n\nThe short duration of follow-up in this study prevented the assessment\nof long-term adherence and virologic outcomes. In addition, while no\nstatistical difference was observed in the likelihood of maintaining\nsuppression or experiencing virologic failure between individuals with\nand without delayed injection, power to detect a difference was limited\nby the small number of events. However, the main objective of the study\nwas to understand patterns of adherence. This early assessment of\nCAB + RPV use is important to support clinical decision making as uptake\nof this new treatment option increases. Recording of target dates was\ninconsistent in the electronic health records and implemented\ndifferently across providers and clinics. Therefore, the target date was\nreset every month to the same day as the previous injection and a 7-day\nwindow before and after the target was implemented in accordance with\nthe label. Another study limitation was the unavailability of resistance\ntesting results for analysis, which could have an impact on virologic\neffectiveness. The small number of confirmed virologic failures\nprevented the assessment of its predictors. Safety outcomes could not be\nassessed in this study. Finally, this study was limited to monthly\ninjections; no inference can be made for the every 2 months dosing\nschedule.\n\nThis study was conducted with data from the OPERA cohort, a large,\ndiverse cohort representative of HIV care in the US. Over 80 clinics\nranging from small rural practices to large metropolitan healthcare\ncenters contribute data to OPERA, which, at the time of this study,\nincluded EHR data from over 145,000 people with HIV, representing close\nto 14% of people with HIV in the US \\[ 18 \\]. This large database of\nroutine clinical care data provided access to information on procedures\nsuch as CAB + RPV LA injectable administration, as well as laboratory\ntesting in a real-world population of people with HIV starting a\nCAB + RPV LA injectable regimen in the US. With 321 individuals\nreceiving CAB + RPV LA injectables and 1152 continuation injections\nadministered over 13 months, this is the largest real-world assessment\nof monthly CAB + RPV LA injectable administration and virologic outcomes\nto date.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this large US cohort of routine clinical HIV care, monthly CAB + RPV\nLA injectable was associated with high levels of virologic control. In\naddition, most monthly CAB + RPV LA continuation injections were\nadministered within the target window. These results suggest that\nCAB + RPB LA injectable can be administered effectively during routine\nclinical care.\n\n\n## Funding\n\nThis work was funded by ViiV Healthcare.

We have conducted multi-center, prospective study, which aimed to\nestablish HIV-1 subtype and assess the presence of primary drug\nresistance mutations to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors,\nnon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors\nin antiretroviral treatment naïve patients. The clinical trial recruited\n117 individuals during 2 years period (2020--2022). The prevalence of\nHIV-1 subtype A was statistically significantly more frequent in\nUkrainian, and HIV-1 subtype B in Polish patients (p \\< 0.05). Drug\nresistance mutations were detected in 44% of all cases and the\ncomparison of presence of mutations in the analyzed groups, as well as\nin the subgroups of subtype A and B HIV-1 has not revealed any\nsignificant differences (p \\> 0.05), nevertheless Polish patients had\nmultidrug resistance mutations more frequent (p \\< 0.05). The results\nfrom our trial show no increased risk of transmission of multidrug\nresistant HIV strains in our cohort of Ukrainian migrants.\n\n\n## Theoretical/Conceptual Framework\n\nSurveillance of primary resistance can supply information to support the\nrational use of ART in prophylactic and therapeutic schemes \\[ 16 \\].\nDue to changes in epidemiological pattern in newly diagnosed patients\nwith HIV infection in Poland and increase in number of HIV positive\npatients from Ukraine we aimed to assess whether in newly diagnosed, ART\nnaïve patients the presence of transmitted DRMs in the population of\nmigrants from eastern Europe differs from the pattern of primary\nresistance in not foreign born individuals (Fig. ​ (Fig.1). 1 ).\n\nFig. 1\n\nMigration movements and site of recruitment\n\n\n\n## Methods\n\nWe have conducted multi-center, prospective, observational, cross\nsectional study. The patients were recruited during 2 years period\n(2020--2022). The site of the recruitment of the cohorts were six\nclinical centers in Poland (two centers in Warsaw and one center in each\ncity: Olsztyn, Lublin, Łódź and Rzeszów), all in the closest regions to\nthe Polish--Ukrainian border, which cover territorially 40% of refugees\n\\[ 1 , 2 \\]. The clinical trial received a positive opinion from the\nBioethics Committee at the Medical University of Warsaw (Number of\nconsent: AKBE/206/2020) and was registered on clinicaltrials.gov\n(Number: NCT04636736 ).\n\nInclusion criteria were recent diagnosis with HIV-1 infection (newly\nrecognized patients), no history of ART, age 18 years or older. The\npatients were selected by cooperating physician in collaborating centre\non the basis of the polish or foreign nationality when they met the\ninclusion criteria. We collected epidemiological data such as: age,\ngender, BMI, origin, migration data, sexual preferences and clinical\ndata: HIV viral load, CD4 + cells count, presence of AIDS-defining\ndiseases, implemented ART, serology of HBV and HCV co-infections. All\npatients who had positive test result for any of the following: HBs-Ag,\nanti-Hbc, HBV-DNA were considered individuals with HBV co-infection and\nall patients who had positive test result for anti-HCV or HCV-RNA were\nconsidered HCV co-infected. In all patients, before starting ART, the\npresence of HIV-1 DRMs to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors\n(NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and\nprotease inhibitors (PI). Undetectable viral load was defined as a \\< 50\ncopies of HIV-RNA/ml of the peripheral blood and virological failure was\ndefined as a detectable HIV-1 viral load after 6 months from the\ninitiation of the ART.\n\nThe drug resistance genotyping of HIV-1 protease (PR) and reverse\ntranscriptase (RT) coding region was performed based on a Sanger\nsequencing method with use of commercially available ViroSeq HIV-1\nGenotyping System (Abbott Molecular, Des Plains, IL, USA). The sequences\nwere submitted to the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database (\nhttp://hivdb.stanford.edu ) in order to comparison of potential\ndifferences in the interpretation of the significance of genetic\nvariants detected. For HIV-1 subtype and circular recombinant forms\n(CRFs) determination of partial pol submitted sequences REGA HIV-1\nSubtyping Tool Version 3.0 was used. The HIV-1 viral loads (VL) were\nmeasured by real time PCR system (Abbott). Immunophenotyping and count\nof T lymphocyte CD4 + and CD8 + subsets were determined using flow\ncytometry method with application of TriTEST fluorescence-conjugated\nmonoclonal antibodies (BD Biosciences, Australia). Data were acquired\nand analysed using multichannel dual-laser BD FACSCalibur analyser with\nBD MultiSET software.\n\nFor the statistical evaluation the Shapiro--Wilk test was performed for\nthe verification of the normality of the distributions in the analyzed\nvariables. Student's t-test or Mann--Whitney U test was used to evaluate\nthe difference in mean value in continuous variables and χ 2 or Fisher\nexact tests was performed for categorical variables. A p value\nof \\< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical\nanalyses were performed using Python 3.7 software and Statistica 13.1\nprogram (StatSoft Poland, Kraków, Poland).\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Study Group\n\nThe inclusion and exclusion criteria met 117 patients. We have recruited\n78 patients from two centers in Warsaw, 28 patients from Olsztyn, 6 from\nLublin, 3 from Łódź and 2 patients from Łańcut center. Because of the\nlack of the results of genotyping in 34 individuals they were excluded\nfrom the analysis. In the study group there were 61 patients (52.14%)\nfrom eastern countries (34 men, 27 women) and 56 patients (47.86%) from\nPoland (52 men, 4 women). Among patients from eastern countries there\nwere 58 patients (95.08%) from Ukraine (11 war refugees and 47 patients\nwho arrived to Poland before the onset of war), 3 patients (4.92%) from:\nBelarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan. The baseline characteristics of the\npatients are presented in Table ​ Table1 1 .\n\nWe observed statistically significant difference in HIV viral load,\nbaseline CD4 cell count, the route of HIV transmission, the presence of\nAIDS-defining diseases and HBV coinfection in patients from eastern\ncountries in comparison to Polish patients. Eastern countries patients\nhad significantly lower HIV mean viral load at diagnosis: 2,45 × 10 ^5^\nvs 6,73 × 10 ^5^ copies/ml (4.42 log ~10~ vs 5.07 log ~10~ )\n(p = 0,001), higher baseline lymphocyte CD4 count: 295 vs 218 cells/µl\n(p = 0,016), less AIDS-defining diseases: 16 vs 28 (p = 0,047) and more\nfrequently HBV coinfection: 14 vs 4 (p = 0,007). There were less\nindividuals from eastern countries who were infected with HIV via male\nto male sexual contact (MSM) and more infected via heterosexual contact.\nIn the analyzed group of patients there were 44 people (37.61%) with\nAIDS-defining diseases, among them 20 individuals (45.45%) had more than\none AIDS defining disease at the time of diagnosis. Among AIDS-defining\ndiseases occurring in patients from eastern countries there were\nsignificantly more tuberculosis, whereas wasting syndrome was more\nprevalent among patients from Poland (p = 0.05).\n\n### HIV-1 Subtype\n\nWe examined the HIV-1 subtype in the group of Ukrainian and Polish\npatients. Table ​ Table2 2 shows the results of HIV-1 subtype evaluation.\nIn the analyzed cohort we observed the dominance of HIV-1 subtype A\namong individuals from eastern countries and the subtype B among people\nfrom Poland (p \\< 0.05).\n\n### HIV-1 Drug Resistance\n\nAmong the analyzed cohorts we assessed the presence of HIV DRMs. In the\ngroup of patients from eastern countries there were 23 (37.70%), and in\nthe group of Polish patients 28 individuals (50.00%) with DRMs\n(p = 0.218), which corresponded to 43.59% of all recruited patients.\nAmong people from eastern countries 6 patients (9.84%) and among Polish\nones 16 patients (28.57%) had more than one mutation (p = 0.033). There\nwere 3 patients from Poland (5.36%) with three drug mutations. 2\nUkrainian patients (3.45%) and 8 Polish ones (14.29%) had mutations\nconcerning more than one class of ART (p = 0.155). Further results are\nshown in Table ​ Table3. 3 . We analyzed the occurrence of specific drug\nresistance mutations among both: patients from eastern countries and\nPolish patients. The comparative results are presented in Table ​ Table4\n4 .\n\n### Applied ART Regimen and Response to Treatment\n\nAmong the analyzed groups of patients we assessed the applied\nantiretroviral therapy regimens. The results are shown in Table ​ Table5.\n5 . One patient from eastern countries voluntarily did not begin the\ntreatment therefore that person was excluded from the analysis. The\npatients were observed from the time of diagnosis to September\n2022---the mean time of observation was 20.15 months (minimum 5, maximum\n52 months).\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Cohort Representativeness\n\nThe number of new diagnosed HIV-1 infections in Ukraine during recent\nyears reached amount around 16 thousand cases every year. Almost 65% of\nHIV-1 transmissions occur annually through heterosexual contact, 30% are\ndue to IDU and only 3% occur among MSM \\[ 3 \\]. If assuming that 5.6\nmillion displaced people from Ukraine, who arrived in EU/EEA countries\ntill May 2022, are representative for whole population of Ukraine, up to\n60 thousands additional PLWH may be living in the EU/EEA. Considering\nthe above, it's estimated that up to 14,000 Ukrainian refugees may be\nliving in the EU/EEA with an undiagnosed HIV infection \\[ 5 , 17 \\].\nBecause of the restrictions in crossing the Ukraine's borders by men\naged 18--59 years old (sexually active group and IDU), it has been\nestimated that among Ukrainian refugees 95.6% were juveniles and adult\nwomen. Therefore the population of Ukrainian war migrants in the EU/EEA\ncannot be fully representative to the whole population of this country.\nDespite that fact, the evaluation of molecular characteristic of the\nprimary HIV-1 resistance to ART should not be affected by this selective\nborder traffic, as the presence of DRMs doesn't depend on age or sex \\[\n17 -- 20 \\].\n\nIn our study among ART naïve, newly diagnosed Ukrainian migrants 44%\nwere women, the majority of patients acquired HIV infection through\nheterosexual contacts, which corresponds with the presented\nepidemiological data \\[ 3 , 19 \\]. Furthermore our study begun in\n2020---before the war, while the male migrants from Ukraine to Poland\nwere frequent. Thanks to this, the study more accurately reflects the\nepidemiology of infections spread, and thus HIV-1 drug resistance\nfrequency, than a potential study limited only to the war period.\n\nIn our cohort all of the patients from Eastern Europe migrated to Poland\nwithin 6 to 12 months before the recruitment to the study, and none of\nthem presented with acute/early retroviral infection. Migration from\nUkraine to Poland, especially in recent years, including the period\n2020--2022, was triggered mainly by the difficult political and economic\nsituation (pre-war conditions). Among 58 patients from Ukraine\nparticipating in our study 11 of them (almost 20%) refugeed after\nbeginning of the war and 47 patients had arrived to Poland earlier. Two\nPolish patient were excluded from the analysis because of the confirmed\nacquisition of HIV infection beyond the Polish borders (Holland,\nIreland). Therefore in most cases our patients acquired HIV infection in\nthe country of residence.\n\n### Subtype A Versus B\n\nSubtype C accounts for almost half (47%) of all HIV-1 infections, while\nB and A for 12% and 10%, respectively. Subtypes can combine to form a\nhybrid: circulating recombinant form (CRF) or unique recombinant form\n(URF). Both, CRF02_AG and CRF01_AE, count for 13% of the cases \\[ 21 \\].\n\nSubtype A remains the most prevalent strain (\\> 50%) in Russia, former\nSoviet Union countries, including Ukraine and in parts of East Africa,\nwhile subtype B predominates in western Europe (75%), Americas and\nOceania. Subtype C mostly can be detected in Southern Africa and India,\nCRF01_AE in Asia and CRF02_AG in Western Africa. Recent studies based on\nnear full-length genome sequencing highlights the growing importance of\nrecombinants variants and subtype C \\[ 22 , 23 \\]. Subtype A strain of\nlow diversity, and a new circulating recombinant form derived from it,\nCRF03_AB and CRF02_AG, emerged in the former Soviet Union (Ukraine) \\[\n24 \\]. In our study, in one patient (from Kazakhstan) we detected that\nthe 3,92% of HIV-1 population was the CRF01_AE recombinant. We haven't\nperformed genotyping to asses HIV sub-subtypes (including A6-a risk\nfactor of increased virological failure to InSTI).\n\nBecause the HIV-1 highly genetic variability, there is no standard\nwild-type strain. Therefore, for drug-resistance studies, mutations are\ndefined as amino acids differences from one of several wild-type\nreference sequences. The most commonly used reference sequences are of\nthe laboratory virus isolates: HXB2, NL43 and a consensus reference\nsequence comprising the most common amino acid at each position in\nwild-type subtype B viruses (subtype B consensus). These sequences are\nalmost identical, differing at a few amino acids not involved in drug\nresistance phenomenon. The use of subtype B consensus as reference is\nbased on historical precedence \\[ 7 , 8 \\]. Nevertheless the data on\nbaseline antiretroviral susceptibility derived from studies of subtype B\nmay not be applicable to all non-B subtypes HIV. DRMs are mostly found\nacross subtypes, but drug resistance is not well studied in non-B\nsubtypes, CRFs and URFs. Therefore continuous surveillance for\ntransmitted drug resistance is essential in all HIV subtypes and\nrecombinants.\n\nDifferential characteristics of viral subtypes and their interactions\nwith the human host may influence the ability of HIV transmission,\ntreatment and disease progression. This concern is illustrated by HIV-2\nand group O strains of HIV-1, which possess intrinsic resistance to\nNNRTIs \\[ 25 -- 27 \\]. Among others, it was also proven that likelihood\nof AIDS developing was increased in the patients infected with a non-A\nsubtype, in others studies such connection was not confirmed \\[ 28 -- 32\n\\]. In our trail 26% of Ukrainian (79% of all cohort infected with\nsubtype A) versus 50% of Polish patients (75% of all cohort with subtype\nB) were late presenters (p \\< 0.05), which is consistent with the\nresults from previously performed studies \\[ 28 , 31 , 32 \\]. Such high\nprevalence of AIDS-defining diseases in our cohort (38% of all recruited\npatients) can be also the result of the characteristic of the sites of\nthe recruitment: most of the centers were clinical departments, mostly\nthe diagnosis were made because of the severe state of the\npatients---they sought medical care (hospitalization) due to poor\ngeneral state and not due to a risky behavior in the individual\nanamnesis. Nevertheless the clinical state during diagnosis (but not the\nperiod of the progression to the AIDS) do not depends directly from the\npresence of the specific DRMs.\n\n### Detected DRMs in the Settings of ART HIV-1 Resistance\n\nMutations leading to resistance appear to be similar among subtypes, but\ncertain mutations seem to occur more frequently in non-B subtypes.\nStudies of HIV-1 non-B subtypes in naïve ART patients have demonstrated\nthat protease and reverse transcriptase coding sequences vary from those\nof the B subtype reference strains in a predictable manner. Among\nothers, polymorphisms in the RT gene do not occur in known sites of DRMs\nwhich corresponds to reduced sensitivity to NRTI. Data from other\nstudies reveal that in naïve ART patients protease coding sequences from\nnon B-subtypes contain substitutions associated with DRMs in B subtype,\nknown to cause secondary resistance. These genotypic changes do not\nconfer consistently decreased susceptibility by themselves when viral\nstrains are subjected to phenotypic testing \\[ 33 , 34 \\]. Furthermore,\nstudies of resistance pattern that emerge in patients receiving ART\nindicate that presence of polymorphisms before start of ART may provide\na background facilitating emergence of specific selection pathways to\nsecondary resistance\\[ 27 , 35 , 36 \\].\n\nOverall most antiretroviral resistance in non-B subtypes are covered by\nthe current resistance databases \\[ 7 , 8 , 37 \\]. Although there are\npotential problems with comparing responses to ART between non-B\nsubtypes and subtype B HIV-1 patients, the available data from the\nclinical practice are encouraging: HIV-1 subtype did not affect response\nto the treatment \\[ 38 -- 40 \\].\n\nAs the emergence of DRMs reduce the effectiveness of antiretroviral\nagents, DRMs are one of the main concerns in the clinical management of\nindividuals with HIV-1 infection. The growing body of evidence confirms\nthat polymorphisms and primary resistance found in various subtypes\nbefore ART may affect genetic pathways of resistance. We outline\nconsiderations for developing a list of drug-resistance mutations for\nepidemiological estimates of transmitted resistance in the face of\nchanging epidemiological situation in EU/EEA. The current list of\nmutations should not only include DRMs associated with\nclinical/phenotypical resistance to HIV-1 but also mutations that may\ncontribute to a reduced virologic response to a drug, especially when\noccur in accumulation. Our study gives up to date information in the\nlight of changed epidemiological situation in central and eastern\nEurope. In our study we haven't recognized increased percentage of DRMs\nassociated with clinical (phenotypical) resistance to ART, but we have\ndetected mutations triggering reduced response to ART in almost half\n(44%) of the recruited patients, which support increasing concern about\nthe emergence of HIV DRMs.\n\n### Limitations of the Study\n\nBecause of the time of the recruitment (SARS COVID-19 epidemy) molecular\ndiagnostic was limited---it was the major cause of lack of InSTI\nresistance testing. Nevertheless, it has been proven that DRMs to new\ngeneration of InSTI do not play role in the ART failure \\[ 41 \\]. As\nwell we haven't performed genotyping to asses HIV sub-subtypes\n(including A6-a risk factor of increased virological failure to InSTI).\n\nAdditionally in the intention to treat (ITT) protocol 72--82% of\npatients achieved undetectable HIV viral load. But this lost to\nfollow-up/lack of the clinical answer to ART was mainly due to short\nperiod of observation (less than 6 months) or the death of the patients.\nOnly 3.5--5% of the patients under the observation had detectable HIV-1\nviral load after 6 months from the initiation of the therapy, which is\nconsistent with the results from RCT trails \\[ 42 , 43 \\].\n\nMoreover, collection and analysis of sequencing data always brings along\nthe lack of current knowledge of the association of new mutations with\ndrug resistance, the occurrence of relevant mutations outside the\nregions targeted by routine resistance assays and the risk of the\npresence of drug-resistant minority of HIV virus population.\n\n### New Contribution to the Literature\n\nFrom a humanitarian and public health perspective, it is vital that\nmigrants living with HIV and/or at risk for HIV who are displaced from\nUkraine have access to HIV care services in EU/EEA. We have demonstrated\nthat the HIV-1 subtype pattern in refugees from eastern countries is\ndifferent: among individuals from Ukraine: HIV-1 subtype A was the\ndominant strain. DRMs were found in almost half of all the cases,\ndifferent mutations in the group of patients from eastern countries and\nin Polish patients were detected, but not with statistical significance.\nThe results from our trial show that Ukrainian migrants from our cohort\ndo not carry elevated number of HIV-1 DRMs and increased risk of\ntransmission with HIV multidrug resistant strains. Furthermore high\nprevalence of DRMs in our study confirms increasing concern about the\nemergence of HIV drug resistance mutations triggering reduced response\nto ART, which can lead to treatment failure.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 20029816\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: To examine the efficacy of these drugs in Cameroon, where diverse non-B HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant viruses predominate, the reverse transcriptase (RT) viral sequences in patient plasma were analyzed for the presence of mutations that confer drug resistance. Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon.\nRationale: The paper doest not mention in vitro drug susceptibility data or phenotypic data.

Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences.

We determined the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity in Bulgaria during 2012--2020 using polymerase sequences from 1053 of 2010 (52.4%) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. Sequences were analyzed for DRM using the WHO HIV SDRM list implemented in the calculated population resistance tool at Stanford University. Genetic diversity was inferred using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetics. Cluster detection and characterization was performed using MicrobeTrace. The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%). Most (34/60, 56.7%) of the SDRMs were present in transmission clusters of different subtypes composed mostly of male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC), including a 14-member cluster of subtype B sequences from 12 MMSC and two males reporting heterosexual contact; 13 had the L90M PI mutation and one had the T215S NRTI SDRM. We found a low SDRM prevalence amid high HIV-1 diversity among ART-naive patients in Bulgaria during 2012--2020. The majority of SDRMs were found in transmission clusters containing MMSC, indicative of onward spread of SDRM in drug-naive individuals.

Resistance selection was performed with escalating concentrations of the NNRTIs ranging from the 95% effective concentration (1 × EC(95)) to 1,000 × EC(95) in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. In the resistance selection of subtype B virus with DOR, a V106A mutant virus led to two mutation pathways, followed by the emergence separately of either F227L or L234I. In the resistance selection of subtype A and C viruses, similar mutation development pathways were detected, in which a V106A or V106M mutant was also the starting virus in the pathways.\nRationale: The paper reported in vitro resistance selection of subtype B virus on DOR, RPV, EFV, becaues all viruses were from selection assay, no sequence were from HIV infected individuals.\nAnswer: Not reported"}

PDR was analyzed using the Stanford HIV drug resistance\ndatabase, and the Tamura-Nei 93 model in HIV-TRACE was used to calculate\npairwise matches with a genetic distance of 0.01 substitutions per site.\nLogistic regression was used to identify and estimate factors associated\nwith PDR.\n\n### Results\n\nPDR testing was conducted on 2568 participants in 2022. Of the\nparticipants, 34.8% (n=893) were aged 30-49 years, 81.4% (n=2091) were\nmale, and 3.2% (n=81) had prior ARV exposure. The prevalence of PDR to\nprotease and reverse transcriptase regions, nonnucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors,\nand protease inhibitors were 7.4% (n=190), 6.3% (n=163), 1.2% (n=32),\nand 0.2% (n=5), respectively. Yunnan, Jilin, and Zhejiang had much\nhigher PDR incidence than did Sichuan. The prevalence of nonnucleoside\nreverse transcriptase inhibitor--related drug resistance was 6.1%\n(n=157) for efavirenz and 6.3% (n=163) for nevirapine. Multivariable\nlogistic regression models indicated that participants who had prior ARV\nexposure (odds ratio \\[OR\\] 7.45, 95% CI 4.50-12.34) and the CRF55_01B\nHIV subtype (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.41-4.83) were significantly associated\nwith PDR. Among 618 (24.2%) sequences (nodes) associated with 253\nmolecular transmission clusters (size range 2-13), drug resistance\nmutation sites included K103, E138, V179, P225, V106, V108, L210, T215,\nP225, K238, and A98.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThe overall prevalence of PDR in China in 2022 was modest. Targeted\ngenotypic PDR testing and medication compliance interventions must be\nurgently expanded to address PDR among newly diagnosed people living\nwith HIV in China.\n\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study Design and Study Population\n\nWe selected 8 provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs) in China\nas the study area to conduct a large multicenter observational\ncross-sectional study. Two-stage systematic sampling in each PLAD was\nconducted according to the WHO PDR surveillance guidelines \\[ 23 \\].\nProvinces were stratified into the following 3 categories based on their\nHIV incidence rates: high (\\>2.00 cases per 10,000 individuals; included\nSichuan Province, Chongqing Municipality, and Yunnan Province), moderate\n(0.52-1.99 cases per 10,000 individuals; included Jiangsu Province and\nZhejiang Province), and low (\\<0.52 cases per 10,000 individuals;\nincluded Jilin Province, Hebei Province, and Hubei Province).\n\nGuided by WHO PDR surveillance guidelines, we calculated the minimum\nnecessary sample size by assuming the prevalence of PDR was 10% and the\nCI range was ±5%. We sampled 11-20 clinics in each PLAD according to the\nnumber of HIV-positive individuals starting or restarting ART in the\npast 12 months. The minimum sample size in each PLAD was 158-179\nsamples. To ensure a minimum necessary sample size, we assumed that 40%\nof collected specimens would be lost to factors such as laboratory\nfailure and a design effect. Expected and actual sample sizes for each\nprovince are shown in Multimedia Appendix 1 . Recruitment and specimen\ncollection of HIV-positive individuals occurred in 2022 as individuals\ninitiated ART.\n\nThe study eligibility criteria for individuals included the following:\n(1) tested HIV-positive, (2) ≥18 years old, (3) started or restarted\nfirst-line ART between January and June 2022 (includes women exposed to\nARV drugs for preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV, people who\nhave received pre-exposure prophylaxis, and individuals reinitiating\nfirst-line ART), and (4) provided informed consent.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nEach study participant was assigned a confidential and unique patient\nidentifier used for linking basic epidemiological information and\nspecimens. Basic sociodemographic data were collected, including age,\nsex, ethnicity, education level, marital status, occupation, route of\ninfection, prior ARV exposure, time elapsed since HIV diagnosis, and\nPLADs. Clinical information included patients' CD4 cell count before ART\nand HIV subtype.\n\n### Laboratory Tests\n\nViral RNA was extracted from 200 µL plasma samples using the QIAamp\nviral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilton, Germany) according to the\noperational instructions. Extracted RNA was used for first-round\npolymerase chain reaction, and the products were used for second-round\npolymerase chain reaction amplification; both rounds were performed in\n25 µL volume reactions to amplify the HIV pol gene region (HXB2:\n2253-3553 nt). This covered the PR region (4-99 amino acids) and the\npartial RT region (1-251 amino acids) \\[ 24 \\]. The amplified products\nwere sequenced by Sanger sequencing.\n\n### Subtype and Drug Resistance Analysis\n\nSequencher (version 4.10.1, Gene Codes Corp) software was used to\nrecombine and edit the original sequence fragments and nucleosides.\nBioEdit (version 7.0.9, Informer Technologies) software was used to\nrealign the HXB2 reference sequence. The sequences were realigned, and\nsome common reference sequences (including A to K) were used to identify\nthe subtype by constructing neighbor joining phylogenetic trees in MEGA\n(version 7.0.26, MEGA Software). Subtypes with a bootstrap value higher\nthan 70% were determined using HXB2 as the reference sequence. Sequences\nwere realigned using the HIV database website \\[ 25 \\]. Realigned\nsequences were uploaded to the Stanford Drug Resistance Database \\[ 26\n\\] to identify the degree of resistance of the 12 listed drugs that the\nWHO recommends for monitoring, namely, EFV, NVP, abacavir, zidovudine,\nlamivudine, tenofovir, emtricitabine, stavudine, didanosine,\nlopinavir/r, atazanavir/r, and darunavir/r. Corresponding DR mutant\ngenes with levels of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were classified as sensitive,\npotential resistance, low resistance, moderate resistance, and high\nresistance, respectively. Only mutations characterized as low, moderate,\nor high resistance were considered resistant. All possible sample mutual\ncontamination, laboratory contamination, and other sequence quality\ncontrols were monitored by constructing neighbor joining phylogenetic\ntrees and using the WHO HIVDR QC tool \\[ 27 \\].\n\n### Construction of the Molecular Network\n\nRealigned sequences were conducted to calculate pairwise genetic\ndistances though the Tamura-Nei 93 model in the transmission cluster\nengine, HIV-TRACE \\[ 28 \\]. Sequences no longer than 1000 bp or\ncontaining ≥5% ambiguities were excluded. A threshold genetic distance\nof 0.01 substitutions per site was used to observe transmission events\nthat may occur within 5-6 years \\[ 29 \\]. Each individual in the\nmolecular network was represented by a node, and each node in the\nmolecular transmission network represented HIV-positive individuals who\nwere matched with epidemiological information. We then linked nodes to\neach other if their pairwise genetic distance was up to 0.01\nsubstitutions per site. Web pages were used to visualize molecular\nnetworks, which were based on technical guides for HIV transmission\nnetwork monitoring and intervention \\[ 30 \\]. The results and subsequent\nmolecular network diagram are accessible on the web \\[ 31 \\]. Our\nprevious studies used other software, such as HYPHY to calculate the\npairwise gene distance and Cytoscape for visualization \\[ 20 , 32 , 33\n\\]. Clusters were defined as containing 2 or more nodes with\nHIV-positive individuals in the same cluster having potential for\ntransmission.\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\nAll quantitative data analyses were performed using the Statistical\nAnalysis System version 9.4 (SAS Institute). Two-sided *P* values \\<.05\nwere considered statistically significant. All variables were assessed\nusing univariate binary logistic regression. Variables significantly\nassociated ( *P* \\<.05) with the outcome were entered into a stepwise\nregression model to remove collinear variables. The remaining variables\nwere entered into a multivariate binary logistic regression model to\nidentify correlates of PDR. The *P* value of the final multivariate\nlogistic regression model was \\<.05.\n\n### Ethical Considerations\n\nThis study was approved by the ethics committee of the National Center\nfor AIDS/STD Control and Prevention, China Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (approval number X140617334).\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Characteristics of the Study Participants\n\nA total of 2869 HIV-positive individuals were initially recruited into\nthe study. After removal of 16 HIV-positive individuals who were younger\nthan 18 years and 9 individuals who had not started ART, the penultimate\nsample size was 2844. PDR test results were available for 90.3% (n=2568)\nof participants in RT/PR regions, thus yielding a final sample size of\n2568. Of the 2568 study participants with valid PDR results, 34.8%\n(n=893) were aged 30-49 years, 81.4% (n=2091) were male, 86.8% (n=2229)\nwere of Han ethnicity, 30.5% (n=783) had a junior high school education,\n37% (n=950) were single, 36% (n=924) were farmers, and 57.6% (n=1480)\nand 37% (n=951) were infected through heterosexual and homosexual\nintercourse, respectively. In addition, 3.2% (n=81) of participants had\nprior ARV drug exposure, 84.5% (n=2170) were diagnosed in 2022, and\n37.5% (n=962) had CD4 cell counts of 0-199 cells/mm ^3^ prior to ART\ninitiation ( Table 1 ).\n\n### PDR and Mutations\n\nAmong the 2568 included study participants, PDR was detected in 7.4%\n(n=190). Table 2 shows the prevalence of overall PDR in Hebei (13/175;\n7.4%), Jilin (19/206; 9.2%), Jiangsu (24/335; 7.2%), Zhejiang (34/385;\n8.8%), Hubei (20/362; 5.5%), Chongqing (20/378; 5.3%), Sichuan (17/350;\n4.9%) and Yunnan (43/377; 11.4%) in 2022. The prevalence of PDR in\nYunnan ( *P* =.002), Jilin ( *P* =.047), and Zhejiang ( *P* =.04) was\nmuch higher than that in Sichuan. Additionally, the prevalence of PDR in\nYunnan was significantly higher than those in Chongqing ( *P* =.002) and\nHubei ( *P* =.004).\n\nOf the 2568 cases studied, the prevalence of PDR to NNRTIs, nucleoside\nreverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs)\nwere 6.3% (n=163), 1.2% (n=32), and 0.2% (n=5), respectively.\nNNRTI-related DR to EFV and NVP was 6.1% (n=157) and 6.3% (n=163),\nrespectively. There were 14 NNRTI-related resistance mutations; the most\ncommon mutations were K103N/S (n=81, 3.2%), followed by V179D/E/IL\n(n=39, 1.5%), and E138A/G/K (n=31, 1.2%). Among NRTI-related DR, the\nmost frequent PDR drug was abacavir (n=19, 0.7%), followed by stavudine\n(n=17, 0.7%), emtricitabine (n=15, 0.6%), lamivudine (n=15, 0.6%),\ndidanosine (n=13, 0.5%), zidovudine (n=10, 0.4%), and tenofovir (n=8,\n0.3%). We detected 10 NRTI-related resistance mutations, of which\nM184V/I (n=13, 0.5%) was the most common. Even in the PR region, 0.2%\n(n=5) PI-related PDR to atazanavir/r and lopinavir/r was detected,\nincluding the PI-related DRMs L90M/IM (n=3, 0.1%), N88T/D (n=1, 0.1%),\nand V82IM (n=1, 0.1%) ( Table 3 ).\n\n### Factors Associated With PDR\n\nTable 4 lists the factors associated with PDR in PR/RT regions. Compared\nwith participants without prior ARV drug exposure, those who had prior\nARV drug exposure had 7.45 times greater odds of PDR (odds ratio \\[OR\\]\n7.45, 95% CI 4.50-12.34). Compared to participants with the CRF07_BC\nsubtype, those with the CRF55_01B subtype had 2.61 times greater odds of\nPDR (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.41-4.83).\n\n### Molecular Transmission Network\n\nOf the 2568 sequences in the PR/RT regions, 13 sequences were removed\nbecause the sequences in the PR/RT regions were shorter than 1000 bp or\nthe number of mixed bases was \\>5%. Hence, a total of 2555 sequences in\nthe PR/RT regions were used to construct a molecular transmission\nnetwork. Under the optimal genetic distance threshold of 0.01\nsubstitutions per site, 618 (24.2%) sequences (nodes) were linked to a\ntotal of 253 clusters (size range 2-13). We identified 38 sequences with\nPDR strains among 19 clusters. Most PDR strains linked to clusters had\nresistance to NNRTIs (36 of 38 sequences); DRM sites included K103,\nE138, V179, P225, V106, V108, L210, T215, P225, K238, and A98.\nIndividual PDR status was not statistically significantly associated\nwith belonging to a cluster. Cluster 01 with PDR consisted of 6 nodes in\nJiangsu. Cluster 02 included HIV-positive individuals from 5 nodes in\nthe same clinic sites in Zhejiang and 1 node in Hubei ( Figure 1 ).\n\nFigure 1\n\nMolecular transmission network among HIV-positive individuals in 2022 in\nChina.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn 2022, a cross-sectional survey was conducted to examine the\nprevalence of PDR among HIV-positive individuals in 8 PLADs in China.\nThe results showed that the overall prevalence of PDR was 7.4%.\nAccording to the WHO's qualitative classification of PDR prevalence\nlevels, a prevalence below 5% is considered low, a prevalence between 5%\nand 15% is moderate, and a prevalence ≥15% is high \\[ 5 \\]. Therefore,\nthe overall prevalence of PDR in 2022 in China and those of 7 PLADs (all\nbut Sichuan) were considered moderate. The prevalence of PDR in 13 PLADs\nand 31 PLADs in China was 6.8% and 4.4% in 2017 and 2018, respectively\n\\[ 34 , 35 \\]. Monitoring and surveillance are needed to assess the\nextent to which resistant strains have spread, and new technologies and\nstrategies should be applied to effectively curb the spread of PDR.\n\nOur study revealed that the PDR rate of NNRTIs was 6.3%. However, the\nPDR NNRTI prevalence was 10.3% for Yunnan. We observed higher PDR rates\nin Zhejiang and Yunnan in 2022 compared to surveys conducted in 2018\n(3.7% in Zhejiang and 3.8% in Yunnan) and this increase in PDR\nprevalence was driven mainly by NNRTI resistance. According to WHO ART\nguidelines developed in 2016, it is recommended to consider implementing\nsupplementary first-line antiviral treatment plans when the prevalence\nof PDR is equal to or greater than 10% for NNRTIs in HIV-positive\nindividuals who are starting first-line ART \\[ 36 \\]. Further research\nis needed to identify the underlying reasons for the high NNRTI PDR\nrates in Yunnan. From 2014 to 2020, 21 of 30 countries that reported\ninvestigations to the WHO had an NVP or EFV PDR rate that exceeded 10%\namong HIV-positive individuals starting first-line ART \\[ 37 \\]. In our\nstudy, we found that the prevalence of EFV and NVP DR was 6.1% and 6.3%,\nrespectively. The main DRM sites identified were K103, E138, V179, and\nV106. These results are consistent with earlier surveys conducted in\nChina in 2015 and 2018 \\[ 32 , 34 \\]. Studies from Zimbabwe, Kenya, and\nArgentina have identified K103 as the most common DRM site for NNRTIs\nused as first-line antiviral drugs \\[ 38 - 40 \\]. National HIV treatment\nstrategies and regimens should be reconsidered given the high prevalence\nof NNRTI DR. In 2023, the *National Free HIV Antiviral Treatment Drug\nTreatment Manual* was released in China, and rilpivirine was added as\nthe first-line treatment regimen \\[ 41 \\]. The RPV resistance rate in\nour study was 5.3% (137/2568). The PDR after rilpivirine is applied to\nfirst-line treatment alternatives should be continuously monitored.\n\nOur 2022 study indicated that PDR rates have increased in China over the\npast 7 years for NRTI DR (from 1.1% in 2015 and 0.8% in 2018 to 1.2% in\n2022) and PI DR (from 0.02% in 2015 and 0.07% in 2018 to 0.2% in 2022)\n\\[ 34 \\]. Nonetheless, PDR rates for NRTIs and PIs in China generally\nappear to be lower than the WHO's estimated regional PDR rates in Africa\n(NRTI PDR: 6.1%; PI PDR: 0.3%), the Americas (NRTI PDR: 6.4%; PI PDR:\n0.8%), Southeast Asia (NRTI PDR: 3.1%; PI PDR: 0.4%), and the Western\nPacific (NRTI PDR: 4%; PI PDR: 0%) \\[ 37 \\].\n\nResults of the multivariable analysis indicated that individuals who had\nprior ARV drug exposure had 7.45 times greater odds of PDR compared to\nthose without prior ARV drug exposure. Such findings are consistent with\nresearch from Mexico, African countries, and Northeast China \\[ 42 - 44\n\\]. There was an increasing trend of the proportion of CRF55_01B\nsamples, rising from 2.3% in 2015 to 3.9% in 2018 and 4.1% in 2022 in\nChina \\[ 34 \\]. Additionally, participants with the CRF55_01B subtype\nhad 2.61 times greater odds of PDR (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.41-4.83) compared\nto participants whose subtype was CRF07_BC. This may be due to\nassociation with V179 as a characteristic DR site of CRF55_01B, and V179\nbeing frequently associated with E138G and causing low resistance to EFV\nand NVP \\[ 45 \\]. Controlling the spread of CRF55_01B may be helpful for\nmitigating the proliferation of drug resistance. Furthermore, it is\nimperative to enhance the quality and effectiveness of intervention\nservices for HIV-positive individuals.\n\nIn this study, we did not detect any statistically significant\nassociations between having a PDR strain and belonging to clusters. Such\nresults are similar with findings from Shijiazhuang city, Hebei Province\nand Liangshan region, Sichuan Province \\[ 46 , 47 \\]. One possible\nexplanation for these findings is that the transmission potential of DR\nstrains is weaker than that of nonresistant wild strains \\[ 47 , 48 \\].\nThe predominant subtype among the sequences in the molecular\ntransmission network was CRF07_BC (representing 46.6% of strains), which\nis consistent with findings from a 2018 national molecular transmission\nnetwork survey in China \\[ 32 \\]. Clustered transmission of K103N DRMs\nin our study was observed in the molecular transmission network and is\nsimilar to findings from molecular transmission network studies in\ncoastal Kenya \\[ 49 \\]. It is worth noting that 6 DR strains in cluster\n01 were from HIV-positive individuals at identical sites in Jiangsu\nProvince. Epidemiological data indicated that all 6 were adult men aged\nyounger than 30 years, of whom 5 reported homosexual transmission and 1\nreported heterosexual transmission. Cluster 02 contained 6 samples with\nDR strains from HIV-positive individuals in the same clinic sites in\nZhejiang Province, of whom 5 reported heterosexual transmission and 1\nreported homosexual transmission, suggesting a possible clustered\ntransmission of DR strains in that area.\n\nOur study has several limitations. Due to sampling limitations, clinic\nsites were established in different counties and districts, and only\n20-80 patients were enrolled in each site during a certain period of\ntime. This may have resulted in smaller observable clusters (containing\n2-13 nodes) in the molecular network and a lower network access rate. In\naddition, when detecting drug-resistant strains using genotyping, Sanger\nsequencing may not be able to detect up to 20% of less prevalent PDR\nstrains \\[ 24 \\]. This may have resulted in an underestimation of the\nPDR rate in HIV-positive individuals.\n\nThe findings from our 2022 PDR survey in China indicate a need to review\nand reconsider the standard ART protocol in some PLADs. Additional\nresources and strategies are needed in regions within China experiencing\na higher prevalence of PDR. Possible interventions include extending\npilot genotypic PDR testing to rapidly adjust medication regimens for\nHIV-positive individuals identified with PDR and targeted measures to\nimprove medication compliance and prevention.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 35061671\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Materials and methods\nWe analyzed 1071 HIV-1 pol-gene fragment sequences (2253–3369 bp) from patients who were initiating or reinitiating first-line ART in six EECA counties, i.e., Armenia (n = 120), Azerbaijan (n = 96), Belarus (n = 158), Russia (n = 465), Tajikistan (n = 54), and Uzbekistan (n = 178), between 2017 and 2019. HIV Pretreatment DR (PDR) and drug resistance mutation (DRM) prevalence was estimated using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database. The PDR level was interpreted according to the WHO standard PDR survey protocols. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database and subsequently confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Transmission clusters were determined using Cluster Picker.\nResults\nAnalyses of HIV subtypes showed that EECA, in general, has the same HIV genetic variants of sub-subtype A6, CRF63_02A1, and subtype B, with different frequencies and representation for each country.\nThe prevalence of PDR to any drug class was 2.8% in Uzbekistan, 4.2% in Azerbaijan, 4.5% in Russia, 9.2% in Armenia, 13.9% in Belarus, and 16.7% in Tajikistan. PDR to protease inhibitors (PIs) was not detected in any country. PDR to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) was not detected among patients in Azerbaijan, and was relatively low in other countries, with the highest prevalence in Tajikistan (5.6%). The prevalence of PDR to nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was the lowest in Uzbekistan (2.8%) and reached 11.1% and 11.4% in Tajikistan and Belarus, respectively.\nGenetic transmission network analyses identified 226/1071 (21.1%) linked individuals, forming 93 transmission clusters mainly containing two or three sequences. We found that the time since HIV diagnosis in clustered patients was significantly shorter than that in unclustered patients (1.26 years vs 2.74 years). Additionally, the K103N/S mutation was mainly observed in clustered sequences (6.2% vs 2.8%).\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance and the genetic analysis of HIV-1 sequences from patient samples.

The prevalence of PDR to non‑nucleoside analog reverse‑transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was 17.8% (95% CI 13.6–23.0%) and of PDR to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) was 6.3% (95% CI 1.6–17.1%).

We determined the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity in Bulgaria during 2012--2020 using polymerase sequences from 1053 of 2010 (52.4%) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. Sequences were analyzed for DRM using the WHO HIV SDRM list implemented in the calculated population resistance tool at Stanford University. Genetic diversity was inferred using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetics. Cluster detection and characterization was performed using MicrobeTrace. The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%). Most (34/60, 56.7%) of the SDRMs were present in transmission clusters of different subtypes composed mostly of male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC), including a 14-member cluster of subtype B sequences from 12 MMSC and two males reporting heterosexual contact; 13 had the L90M PI mutation and one had the T215S NRTI SDRM. We found a low SDRM prevalence amid high HIV-1 diversity among ART-naive patients in Bulgaria during 2012--2020. The majority of SDRMs were found in transmission clusters containing MMSC, indicative of onward spread of SDRM in drug-naive individuals.

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents.

Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male.

Population-based estimates of PrEP-related\nresistance are lacking.\n\nMethods\n\nWe used New York City surveillance and partner services data to measure\nthe effect of PrEP use (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/tenofivir\nalafenamide fumarate with emtricitabine) history on the baseline\nprevalence of M184I/V mutations in people with HIV diagnosed in\n2015--2022. PrEP use was categorized as \"recent\" (defined as PrEP\nstopped ≤90 days before diagnosis), \"past\" (PrEP stopped \\>90 days\nbefore diagnosis), or \"no known use.\" Resistance-associated mutations\nwere determined using the Stanford algorithm. We used log binomial\nregression to generate the adjusted relative risk (aRR) of M184I/V by\nPrEP use history in people with or without acute HIV infection (AHI).\n\nResults\n\nOf 4246 people with newly diagnosed HIV and a genotype obtained within\n≤30 days of diagnosis, 560 (13%) had AHI; 136 (3%) reported recent and\n124 (35%) past PrEP use; and 98 (2%) harbored M184I/V. In people with\nAHI, recent PrEP use was associated with a 6 times greater risk of\nM184I/V than no known use (aRR, 5.86 \\[95% confidence interval,\n2.49--13.77\\]). Among people without AHI, the risk of M184I/V in recent\nusers was 7 times that in people with no known use (aRR, 7.26 \\[95%\nconfidence interval, 3.98--13.24\\]), and in past users, it was 4 times\nthat in those with no known use (4.46 \\[2.15--9.24\\]).\n\nConclusions\n\nPrEP use was strongly associated with baseline M184I/V in New York City,\nregardless of AHI status. Ordering a nucleic acid test when indicated\nafter assessment of exposure, antiretroviral history, and AHI symptoms\ncan decrease PrEP initiation in people with undetected infection.\n\n\n## METHODS\n\n### Study Population and Data Sources\n\nWe included people with HIV newly diagnosed between 2015 and 2022,\nassigned for partner services, for whom a genotype obtained within 30\ndays of diagnosis was available in the NYC HIV Surveillance Registry\n(henceforth, Registry). Disease investigation specialists attempt to\ninterview everyone with newly diagnosed HIV to facilitate linkage to\ncare, elicit sex and needle-sharing partners and capture\nsociodemographics, HIV risk, and PrEP and postexposure prophylaxis use\n\\[ 15--17 \\].\n\nPrEP use has been systematically documented since 2015. In addition to\nclient self-report, information is extracted from medical record review,\nprovider interview, the Registry and laboratory databases, provider\nreport form (a mechanism for providers to report new HIV diagnoses to\nthe health department), and NYC surveillance case investigation records.\nData are recorded on an electronic case investigation form and managed\non a secure server, compliant with confidentiality and data security\nprotocols. HIV-related laboratory results (CD4 cell count, HIV viral\nload \\[VL\\], and HIV-1 genotype sequences \\[Sanger or consensus\nsequences when next-generation sequencing is conducted\\]) are reported\nto the health department and stored in the Registry and laboratory\ndatabases. Resistance associated mutations were determined using the\nStanford algorithm \\[ 18 \\].\n\n### Study Design and Variables\n\nWe described PrEP use history, AHI, and the prevalence of M184I/V and\nK65R mutations in a retrospective cohort of people with newly diagnosed\nHIV in 2015--2022. We measured the association of PrEP use history and\ntiming with the presence of M184I/V at their baseline genotype obtained\nwithin 30 days of diagnosis, in people with or without AHI respectively.\n\nThe primary exposure, PrEP use history and timing relative to HIV\ndiagnosis, was categorized as (1) \"recent PrEP use\" (defined as PrEP\nstop or start date in the 0--90 days before diagnosis or a missing stop\ndate where the reasons for discontinuing PrEP included \"HIV diagnosis\"\nor \"tested positive for HIV\"; in these instances the stop date was set\nas the HIV diagnosis date); (2) \"past PrEP use\" (PrEP stop date \\>90\ndays before diagnosis or a missing stop date where the reasons for\ndiscontinuing PrEP did not include \"HIV diagnosis\" or \"tested positive\nfor HIV\"); or (3) \"no known PrEP use.\" We used client self-report,\nprovider report and medical record review to determine PrEP use, stop\nand start dates, and reasons for discontinuing the most recent PrEP\ncourse before diagnosis. PrEP start and stop dates were used to\ncalculate the duration in days of PrEP use. We assessed for PrEP using\nTDF/TAF with FTC and did not differentiate between daily or event-driven\ndosing. Long-acting cabotegravir was not included in our PrEP\nascertainment.\n\nM184I, M184V, M184IV, and M184MV mutations were collapsed into a single\nvariable for any M184I/V mutation. AHI and prediagnosis negative results\nfor the nucleic acid test (NAT) were ascertained through the Registry.\nAHI is defined by either a provider-documented diagnosis based on\nsymptoms present at intake and/or a test history or a spectrum of\nlaboratory test results consistent with AHI \\[ 19--21 \\].\n\n### Statistical Analyses\n\nWe compared sociodemographic characteristics, namely, age group (\\<30 vs\n≥30 years), gender (cisgender men, cisgender women, or transgender\npeople), race and ethnicity (black, Hispanic, white, of other\n\\[Asian/Pacific Islander, Native American, or unknown---grouped owing to\nsmall numbers\\]), and HIV transmission category (men who have sex with\nmen \\[MSM\\], heterosexual contact, transgender people with sexual\ncontact, or injection drug use) of people with varying PrEP use\nhistories, using χ ^2^ /Fisher exact test of significance to assess\ndifferences in proportions ( *P* \\< .05). We reported univariate\nstatistics on the duration of PrEP use in days for people with start and\nstop dates and the number of PrEP users with a negative NAT result in\nthe 0--15 days before their PrEP start date and in the 14 days after it,\nan indication that the test may have informed PrEP eligibility \\[ 22 \\].\n\nWe used log binomial regression to generate stratum-specific (AHI vs no\nAHI) adjusted relative risk (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for\nthe effect of PrEP use on M184I/V mutations. Effect modification by AHI\non the association between PrEP use and the emergence of M184I/V is\nsupported by evidence on the reversion of M184I/V to wild type in the\nabsence of PrEP drugs (1.5--9 months for ADR and 6--60 months for TDR)\n\\[ 8 , 11 \\] suggesting that the mutation is more likely to be detected\nin people with HIV diagnosed earlier in the infection.\n\nWe examined the association of age, gender, race and ethnicity, and HIV\ntransmission category with PrEP use history and with the appearance of\nM184I/V to assess for confounding, and we included the transmission\ncategory (dichotomized as MSM vs other categories collapsed owing to\nsmall numbers) in the final model. Statistical analyses were conducted\nusing SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute).\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Descriptive Analysis\n\nOf 10 356 people with a new HIV diagnosis assigned for partner services\nin this time period, a total of 4246 (40%) had an available genotype\nobtained within 30 days of diagnosis and comprised our analytic\npopulation. Among them, 560 (13%) had AHI diagnosed, 98 (2%) had the\nM184I/V mutation, 5 (0.1%) had the K65R mutation, and 2 (\\<0.1%) had\nboth. Any PrEP use was reported by 260 (6%), recent PrEP use by 136\n(3%), and past PrEP use by 124 (3%). The average duration of PrEP use\nwas 326 days (median, 123 days, interquartile range, 31--487 days).\n\nThere were significant differences among the 3 groups based on PrEP use\nhistory and timing. Recent PrEP users had the highest proportion of AHI\ncompared with past users and those with no known use (30%, 19%, and 12%,\nrespectively). Recent and past users were more likely to be non-Hispanic\nwhite than people with no known use (24%, 24%, and 15%, respectively)\nand more likely to be cisgender men (92%, 94% and 79%). A greater\nproportion of recent and past PrEP users had transmission category\nreported as MSM compared with those with no known use (85%, 93%, and\n59%, respectively) ( Table 1 ).\n\nThe prevalence of M184I/V was almost twice as high in people with recent\nPrEP use than those with past use, and 7 times higher than in people\nwith no known use (14% vs 8% vs 2%, respectively). People with diagnosed\nAHI had twice the prevalence of M184I/V of those without AHI (4% vs 2%,\nrespectively). These differences were statistically significant. There\nwere no differences in prevalence of the mutation in terms of age, race\nand ethnicity, or gender ( Table 2 ). Of the 260 PrEP users, 5 (2%) had\na negative NAT result in the 0--4 days and 3 (1%) in the 10--15 days\npreceding PrEP start, and 3 (1%) had a negative NAT result in the 2--11\ndays following PrEP start.\n\n### Log Binomial Regression Models Stratified by AHI Status\n\n#### AHI Diagnosis\n\nAmong those with AHI, people with recent PrEP use, compared with those\nwith no reported PrEP use, had 6 times the risk of having M184I/V at\ntheir baseline genotype (aRR, 5.86 \\[95% CI, 2.49--13.77\\]). The risk of\nhaving the mutation among past users was almost 3 times as high as that\nin people with no known PrEP use (aRR, 2.77 \\[95% CI, .66--11.64\\]),\nalthough this difference was not statistically significant ( Table 3 ).\n\n#### No AHI Diagnosis\n\nAmong people without AHI, those with recent PrEP use had 7 times the\nrisk of having M184I/V of those who had no known PrEP use (aRR, 7.26\n\\[95% CI, 3.98--13.24\\]). The risk of mutation in people with past use\nwas 4 times as high as that in those with no known PrEP use (aRR, 4.46\n\\[95% CI, 2.15--9.24\\]) ( Table 3 ).\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nWe used NYC HIV surveillance and partner services data to establish the\nrelationship between PrEP use history and timing and the development of\nmutations associated with resistance to TDF/TAF or FTC, the components\nof PrEP, in people with newly diagnosed HIV in 2015--2022 and with an\navailable baseline genotype within 30 days of diagnosis. We examined\neffect modification by AHI on this association.\n\nThe M184I/V mutation, conferring resistance to FTC, was found in 2% of\nour population. However, among recent PrEP users the prevalence was 10\ntimes higher than in people with no reported history of PrEP use. Past\nPrEP use, even when not recent, was associated with a 4 times higher\nprevalence of M184I/V. In contrast, the prevalence of the signature TDF\nmutation, K65R was negligible, with none of the 5 people with K65R\nreporting any PrEP use. Large differences in the distribution of M184I/V\nby PrEP use in the 90 days before diagnosis (30% in PrEP users vs 1% in\nthe nonusers) were also reported in a UK clinic-based study \\[ 23 \\]. In\nour analysis, MSM were more likely than those in other transmission\ncategories to present with M184I/V at baseline. This association may be\npartially explained by PrEP use history, given that the majority of PrEP\nusers in our population were MSM. Some part of this association may be\nattributed to transmitted resistance in sexual networks \\[ 24 , 25 \\].\n\nAHI was significantly more frequent in both recent and past PrEP users\nthan in people with no known PrEP use. While only a small subset of our\npopulation was on PrEP at the time of HIV diagnosis, continuation of\nPrEP prescriptions by providers is usually contingent on HIV testing at\n3-month intervals and therefore more likely to lead to diagnosis of\ninfection in the acute phase. Early diagnosis among individuals with a\nhistory of PrEP use may be attributable either to greater access to\nsexual health services and regular HIV testing or to differential\nhealthcare-seeking behavior. Further, disparities in PrEP uptake tend to\nalign with socioeconomic disparities that present barriers to HIV\ntesting \\[ 17 , 26 , 27 \\].\n\nEvidence from the literature indicating that M184I/V tends to decay and\nrevert to wild type over time in the absence of ARVs led us to examine\nwhether the effect of PrEP on presence of the mutation was modified by\nearly diagnosis, here defined by AHI. This was supported by the strong\nassociation of PrEP use with AHI in our data. Given the possibility of\nreversion of resistance and of ADR resulting from suboptimal ARV therapy\n(ART), we considered timing of the baseline genotype as an additional\nfactor in whether M184I/V would be observed, restricting our pool of\ngenotypes to those obtained within 30 days of diagnosis \\[ 8 , 11 \\].\n\nOur data show that PrEP use, particularly recent use, is strongly\nassociated with the presence of M184I/V mutation at the baseline\ngenotype in both strata of AHI. Recency of PrEP use may, in some cases,\nsuggest delayed seroconversion, diagnostic failure, and continued\nselective pressure \\[ 23 \\]. In a population where a proportion of\nbaseline genotypes are delayed, AHI or early diagnosis could have the\npotential to constitute a distinct pathway between PrEP use and the\nmanifestation of M184I/V owing to the role of temporality and the\nincreased likelihood that reversion of resistance may not have occurred.\nHowever, our findings, based on genotypes obtained within 30 days of\ndiagnosis, suggest that AHI does not amplify the effect of PrEP use on\nthe presence of M184I/V. Prior PrEP use might be linked to ADR if PrEP\nwas initiated during undiagnosed infection and continued thereafter, to\neither TDR or ADR if PrEP adherence was suboptimal or if PrEP was used\nintermittently, and to TDR owing to infection with HIV that is resistant\nto TDF/TAF/FTC. Distinguishing TDR from ADR with certainty in the\ncontext of PrEP use exceeds the scope of our data.\n\nOnly 4% of people in our population with any PrEP use history had\nevidence of a negative NAT in the 2 weeks before and after PrEP\ninitiation. While our data cannot speak to the overall use of NAT in the\ncontext of PrEP screening in NYC, they suggest that in populations at\nhighest risk of HIV infection, complete laboratory testing in\nconjunction with symptom, exposure, and previous ARV history assessment\nmay not be occurring at optimal levels to rule out AHI before PrEP\ninitiation.\n\nIn contrast to previous findings on PrEP-related drug resistance in the\nsetting of AHI that have been obtained from PrEP trials, case reports,\nand clinical case series, our study draws its conclusions from HIV\nsurveillance and partner services. Owing to surveillance protocols and\nuniversal partner services in NYC, everyone with a new HIV diagnosis\nreceives health department investigation, making findings based on these\ndata representative of the local population and providing robust sample\nsizes to facilitate hypothesis testing. However, these data have\nlimitations. Our analytic sample comprised people with a baseline\ngenotype within 30 days of HIV diagnosis, which represented only 40% of\nnew diagnoses in this time period. Because of potential biases\nassociated with the receipt of a baseline genotype, these findings\ncannot be said to represent the true prevalence of PrEP-related drug\nresistance in this population. If PrEP was used close to HIV diagnosis,\nplasma VLs may have been below the threshold required to conduct\nresistance testing, potentially leading to an underestimation of drug\nresistance in PrEP users.\n\nWe were lacking reliable data on daily or event-driven dosing,\nadherence, and prediagnosis HIV-negative tests, which could better\ninform causal pathways for acquisition of drug resistance. However,\nwhile these data could have a role in distinguishing ADR from TDR, their\nabsence does not affect the overall measure of the effect of PrEP use\nhistory on the presence of resistance-associated mutations. PrEP use and\ndates were determined through self-report and medical record review,\nleading to a potential for recall and information bias, as well as\ndifferential misclassification of PrEP use and timing. While true PrEP\nusers were confirmed through robust triangulation of sources and had the\nhighest rates of disease investigation specialist interviews, some\npeople with no known PrEP use may have been misclassified. Recent PrEP\nusers missing PrEP stop and start dates as well as reasons for stopping\nPrEP may have been misclassified as past users, leading to\nunderestimation of the effect of recent use on the risk of M184I/V.\n\nIn conclusion, we found a strong association between PrEP use and the\npresence of drug resistance at diagnosis in NYC, a setting of high HIV\nprevalence, regardless of AHI status. Fewer than half of all people with\nnewly diagnosed HIV had a genotype obtained within 30 days of diagnosis.\nThe reasons for this may include lack of drug resistance testing by\nproviders, low VL at the time of testing, and laboratory reporting\nfailure \\[ 28 \\]. The proportion of genotypes conducted within 3 months\nof diagnosis has declined in NYC, from 72% in 2013% to 46% in 2021 \\[ 28\n, 29 \\]. We found that only 4% of people with PrEP use history had\nevidence of a negative NAT result in the plausible time frame of PrEP\nscreening, revealing missed opportunities for identifying undiagnosed\ninfection. NAT can more confidently rule out AHI in people who may be\nreluctant to disclose exposure history, whose illness may be mild,\nnonspecific or asymptomatic, or whose ARV experience may be uncertain.\nIn situations where RNA testing is not feasible owing to cost or time\nconstraints, repeated HIV antigen/antibody testing in the month\nfollowing PrEP start can decrease PrEP use during undiagnosed infection\nand facilitate timely transition to fully suppressive ART \\[ 22 , 30 \\].\nIn addition, providers should adhere to guidelines recommending baseline\ngenotype resistance testing for everyone with a new HIV diagnosis and\nfollow-up genotyping for people found to have drug resistance at\nbaseline, to assess short- and long-term treatment options \\[ 29--32 \\].\n\nThe benefits of PrEP outweigh the risk of ADR. HIV infections averted by\nPrEP would require long-term ART, entailing an estimated annual risk of\ndrug resistance between 5% and 20% \\[ 33 , 34 \\]. While some studies\nshow that people with PrEP-related resistance went on to become virally\nsuppressed within 6 months of diagnosis \\[ 12 , 35 \\] and that\ndolutegravir-based second-line ART regimens have been successful in\nlimiting the effect of M184I/V on ART efficacy \\[ 6 \\], others have\nfound a greater risk of virologic nonsuppression with preexisting\nM184I/V \\[ 6 \\]. Longitudinal assessment of people with PrEP-related\ndrug resistance using population level and surveillance data is\nwarranted.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 36240386\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: Information on the design and outcomes of HPTN 083 (NCT02720094) is presented in the primary study report [1].

A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

Annual proportions of recent infections (RI) among newly diagnosed persons infected with HIV-1 in Slovenia during 27 years (1986--2012) were determined using an algorithm consisting of routine baseline CD4 and HIV viral load measurements and the Aware BED EIA HIV-1 Incidence Test (BED test). The study included the highest coverage of persons diagnosed with HIV during the entire duration of an HIV epidemic in a given country/region (71%). Out of 416 patients, 170 (40.9%) had a baseline CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/mm ^3^ and/or HIV-1 viral load less than 400 copies/ml and were characterized as having a long-standing infection (LSI). The remaining 246 patients were additionally tested using the BED test. Overall, 23% (97/416) of the patients were labeled RI. The characteristics significantly associated with RI were as follows: younger age, acute retroviral syndrome, CDC class A and other than C, no AIDS defining illnesses, HIV test performed in the past, a higher viral load, and a higher CD4 cell count. An interesting trend in the proportion of RI was observed, with a peak in 2005 (47% of RI) and the lowest point in 2008 (12%) in parallel with a rise in the numbers of new HIV diagnoses. This study could help promote the idea of introducing periodic HIV incidence monitoring using a simple and affordable algorithm. J. Med.

Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon.\nRationale: The paper doest not mention in vitro drug susceptibility data or phenotypic data.

We assessed the success\nof ART and the contribution of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) to\nunsuppressed viral loads. Between February and May 2023 a\ncross-sectional survey with random sampling was conducted in the six\nclinics in an urban cohort in Dar es Salaam. Patients with unsuppresed\nviral loads (local criteria viral load (VL) ≥ 1000 copies/mL) were\ntested for HIVDR mutations using the WHO adapted protocol for plasma\nsamples. Mutations were interpreted using the Stanford HIVDR database.\nIn total 600 individuals participated in this survey, the majority were\nfemale (76.83%), mean age ( ± standard deviation) was 44.0 ( ± 11.6)\nyears. The median duration on ART (interquartile range) was 6.5\n(3.9--10.2) years. Approximately 99% were receiving\ntenofovir + lamivudine + dolutegravir as a fixed dose combination. VL\ntesting was successful in 99.67% (598/600) of survey patients and only\n33 had VL ≥ 1000 copies/mL, resulting in a viral suppression level of\n94.48% (565/598, 95% CI 92.34--96.17%). For 23 samples, protease and\nreverse transcriptase (RT) genotyping were successful, with 13 sequences\ncontaining RT inhibitor surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs)\n(56.5%). No SDRM against protease inhibitors were detected. Thirty\nsamples were successfully genotyped for integrase with 3 sequences\n(10.08%) containing integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) SDRMs.\nIn samples successfully genotyped in the three genetic regions, 68.18%\n(16/22) had a genotypic susceptibility score (GSS) ≥ 2.5 for the\nconcurrent regimen, implying factors beyond drug resistance caused the\nunsuppressed viral load. For five patients, GSS indicated that HIVDR may\nhave caused the unsuppressed viral load. All three patients with INSTI\nresistance mutations were highly resistant to dolutegravir and\naccumulated nucleoside and non-nucleoside RT inhibitor HIVDR mutations.\nAlthough in this cohort the last 95 UNAIDS target was almost achieved,\nHIVDR mutations, including INSTIs resistance mutations were detected in\nHIV-positive individuals taking ART for at least one year. We recommend\nthe design and implementation of high-impact interventions to prevent\nthe increase of HIVDR, failure of dolutegravir and address the\nnon-resistance factors in the study area.\n\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Study design and patient\n\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted between February and May 2023 in\nthe Dar es Salaam Urban Cohort Study (DUCS) platform of the Ilala\ndistrict in Dar es Salaam ^^26^^ . DUCS area (Ukonga and Gongolamboto\nadministrative wards) has a total of six HIV care and treatment clinics\n(CTCs); three of which are public owned facilities, two are military\nowned while one is privately owned (faith-based). All adults (18 years\nand above) living with HIV and resident in the DUCS platform area and\nreceiving antiretroviral therapy in CTCs found in the DUCS area were\neligible to participate in the study. Patients who had received ART for\nless than one year were excluded from the study.\n\n### Sample size and sampling technique\n\nThe sample size (n) was computed using a cross sectional formulae for a\nfinite patient; *n* = *N(z* ^*2*^ *) p(1-p)* / *d* ^*2*^ *(N-1)* + *(z*\n^*2*^ *) p(1-p)* ^^27^^ based on the assumption of an estimated\nprevalence (p) of 0.68% ^^15^^ for detecting any HIVDR in adult\nTanzanian patient taking ART. Using type I error of 5% (z = 1.96) and a\nmargin of error (d) of ± 0.55%, a minimum sample size of 565 patients\nwas required. With an oversampling of 20%, to allow for non-responders,\ndrop outs and failures in testing, 720 from the 1651 eligible patients\nwere selected using a simple random sampling (using SPSS version 29,\nChicago Inc., USA) ^^28^^ . Furthermore, a proportional sampling method\nwas used to obtain a representative sample from all six HIV CTCs found\nin the DUCS platform area.\n\n### Patient recruitment procedures\n\nPhone contacts were extracted from patient files, with up to three call\nattempts. Patients visiting the clinic were informed about the study,\nprovided informed consent, completed a questionnaire on electronic\ntablets, and had venous blood drawn. Regardless of consent status,\npatients received reimbursement for transport costs and a one-kilogram\nsugar incentive. This process ensured an organized and incentive-driven\napproach to patient recruitment and study participation.\n\n### Data collection process\n\nThe study questionnaire was designed following a comprehensive\nliterature review ^^12^\\ ,\\ ^24^\\ ,\\ ^25^\\ ,\\ ^29^\\ ,\\ ^30^^ . It\nconsisted of questions about patient social demographic information such\nas; age, sex, employment status, place of residence and marital status,\nquestions designed to reflect on factors associated with HIVDR such as\nHIV status disclosure and health insurance. Patient clinical information\nsuch as regimen used, treatment line and duration on ART were collected\nfrom the record files of the patients (Table ​ (Table1 1 ).\n\n### Blood sample handling, processing and storage\n\nBlood sample collection, transportation and storage were treated\naccording to the Temeke Regional Referral Hospital- Specialized\nLaboratory protocol ^^31^^ . Eight ml of venous blood was drawn using\ntwo EDTA tubes each with 4 ml. Whole blood was separated into plasma\nwithin 6 h of collection, before separation the whole blood was kept at\n2--8 °C. Centrifugation was performed for 10 min at 1000--2000× *g* ,\nthen supernatant (plasma) was kept at − 20 °C with a maximum of 3 times\nof freeze--thaw cycles.\n\n### Viral load testing and HIV drug resistance analysis\n\nViral load testing was performed using Roche cobas® 6800/8800 systems\n^^32^^ (software version 1.3, publication 4.2) with a lower limit of\ndetection of 15 copies/mL. Given that we followed the current Tanzania\nnational HIV treatment guidelines ^^2^^ , only samples with viral load\ncount ≥ 1000 copies/mL were subjected to analysis of HIVDR mutations. We\nused Management and Development for Health (MDH) WHO adapted protocol\n(Unpublished) to perform HIVDR testing using the 3500xL genetic analyser\n(Applied Biosystems), a capillary sequencer using Sanger-style\nsequencing. Analysis of mutations were performed using Stanford\nUniversity HIVDR database version 9.4. Moreover, calibrated patient\nresistance tool (CPR version 8.1) was used to determine proportion of\nmutation suggestive of transmitted HIVDR resistance ^^33^^ . Before\nimporting the generated sequences (fasta format) to Stanford University\nHIVDR database, the raw sequence (abi format) was assembled, aligned and\nedited using a RECall (v2.32)- web based sequence analysis then saved as\nfasta file ^^34^^ . The sequenced codons were 6--99, 1--251, and 1--288,\nfor protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase proteins,\nrespectively. We used Stanford HIVDR ^^33^^ and COMET ^^35^^ to assign\nthe HIV sub-types, and Rega HIV sub-typing tool 3.46 database ^^36^^ was\nconsulted to resolve any disagreements between Stanford and COMET. The\nVL testing and the genotyping data were linked to the questionnaire\ninformation in the DUCS database for analysis.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nDescriptive statistics of the socio-demographic characteristics were\nsummarized using frequencies (n) and percentages (%). In accordance with\nthe Tanzania national HIV treatment guideline ^^7^^ , which was adapted\nfrom the WHO ^^37^^ guidelines, patients were considered to have a\nsuppressed viral load when the count was \\< 1000 copies/mL, while ≥ 1000\ncopies/mL was considered unsuppressed viral load. In addition, in some\nanalysis, viral load counts were stratified into three categories: \\< 50\ncopies/mL, 50--999 copies/mL, and ≥ 1000 copies/mL. The viral\nsuppression was calculated by dividing the number of patients with viral\nload count below 1,000 copies/mL over successfully viral load tested\npatients. In this study we estimated the prevalence of HIVDR as the\nproportions of patients' samples which harboured surveillance drug\nresistance mutations to those patients' with successfully genotyped\nsequences.\n\nWe determined the 95% CI for viral suppression and proportion of\npatients with any major HIVDR mutations using the binomial approximation\n^^38^^ . We used mean and standard deviations or median and\ninterquartile range (IQR) to estimate the measure of central tendencies\nfor symmetrical and asymmetrical continuous data, respectively. Factors\nassociated with unsuppressed viral loads (1000 copies/mL and above) were\ndetermine using binary logistic regression model. Crude and adjusted\nodds ratios (cOR and aOR) were the effect measures for univariate and\nmultivariate for regression analysis, respectively. All variables in\nunivariate analysis were used in the multivariate analysis. We used the\nconfidence interval of 95% (95%CI), and the p-value \\< 0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant.\n\nStatistics were done using SPSS software (SPSS version 29, Chicago Inc.,\nUSA) and Excel spreadsheet 2022 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA).\nThe Genotypic Susceptibility Score (GSS) for the combination\nantiretroviral therapy (regimen) was determined by adding the score of\neach drug used in the regimen, using the Stanford HIVDB scoring system\n^^39^^ . The interpretations of these tests were categorized as\n\\'susceptible\\', \\'possible resistance\\', and \\'resistance\\', which were\nassigned scores of 1, 0.5, and 0, respectively ^^40^^ . Possible\nresistance included potential low-level resistance, low-level\nresistance, and intermediate resistance. Patient was considered\nsusceptible to the regimen if the GSS was ≥ 2.\n\n### Ethics declarations\n\nThe study was approved by Muhimbili University of Health and Allied\nSciences (MUHAS)-Ethical Review Board (Ref No. MUHAS/REC/2020/243) and\nthe National Committee on Medical Research Ethics (Ref No.\nNIMR/HQ/R.8c/Vol.1/1870). Permissions to access the CTCs were requested\nfrom the President\\'s Office---Regional Administration and Local\nGovernment and CTC managers, Dar es Salaam Regional Medical Officer,\nIlala District Medical Officer and CTCs managers. This study complied\nwith the Declaration of Helsinki for medical research involving human\nsubjects.\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Overview of recruitment and genotyped samples\n\nBetween February and May 2023, 7083 treated patients were screened from\nthe HIV care and treatment clinics in the DUCS platform for eligibility\ncriteria and 1651 patients were found eligible for inclusion (Fig. 1 ).\nWith regard to the exclusion criteria, the most common reasons for\nexclusion were (i) not living in the study area (59.45%); (ii) being on\nART for less than one year (12.55%); and, younger than 18 years old\n(3.48%). None who attended their appointment refused to give informed\nconsent. Viral loads were determined in 600 patients, the success rate\nwas 598 samples (99.67%), with 5.52% (n = 33) having unsuppressed viral\nload. Genetic sequencing was successful in the protease and reverse\ntranscriptase regions for 23 patients' samples (69.70%) and in the\nintegrase region for 30 patients' samples (90.90%).\n\nFigure 1\n\nPatients' recruitment flow chart and testing success rates for the HIVDR\nsurvey conducted in Dar es Salaam Urban Cohort Study (DUCS) for patients\nreceiving antiretroviral therapy (ART).\n\n### Characteristics of the surveyed patients\n\nFor the survey patients, we collected socio-demographic and other\ncharacteristics potentially associated with unsuppressed viral load,\nsummarized in Table ​ Table1. 1 . The majority was female, the mean age\nwas 44 years, and the education level was mainly primary education\n(Table ​ (Table1). 1 ). About half of patients were attending the\nmilitary-operated CTCs, most patients spent less than 30 min waiting\nduring clinic visits, and the median time since first HIV diagnosis was\n6.8 years. Approximately, 99% of survey patients were taking TLD\nregimen.\n\nAccording to the local criteria of therapy success (VL \\< 1000\ncopies/mL) 94.48% (565/598, 95% CI 92.34--96.17%) were successfully\ntreated, which comes close to 95%, the goal of UNAIDS for 2025. Those\nwith a viral load count \\< 50 copies/mL accounted for 83.95% (502/598),\nthose with 50--999 copies/mL made up 10.54% (63/598), while those\nwith ≥ 1000 copies/mL constituted 5.52% (33/598).\n\nBoth univariate and multivariate analysis found an association between\nunsuppressed viral loads and time since first HIV-positive test,\npatients diagnosed since less than 2 years had lower odds of having\nunsuppressed viral load (aOR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02--0.69, p = 0.017) as\ncompared to those with at least 10 years since diagnosis. However,\npatients with self-reported other underlying chronic disease conditions\nalso had lower odds of unsuppressed viral load (aOR 0.18, 95% CI\n0.05--0.73, p = 0.016) as compared to their counterparts (Table ​ (Table1\n1 ).\n\n### Characteristics and treatment history of patients with viral load          ≥            1000 copies/mL\n\nThe mean age (± standard deviation) of participants was 42.97 (± 13.16)\nyears, while the mean duration on ART was 6.79 (± 3.67) years (Table ​\n(Table2). 2 ). Moreover, mean (± standard deviation) time since the\nstart of dolutegravir-based regimen was 32.6 (± 12.95) months. Out of 33\npatients, 32 (96.97%) had been initiated on a DTG-based regimen either\nas first therapy or switched from another first line, all of which\nbecause of a national policy change. Many of these patients also had\nprevious treatment changes, and two patients were switched away from\nDTG. The reason for previous changes is not known, however, given that\nall were switched from a first line suggests the previous changes might\nalso have been policy changes or might have been related to side\neffects.\n\nOf 33 patients with high viral load (≥ 1000 copies/mL) despite taking\nART, 30 (90.91%) were using a DTG-based regimen, mostly TDF + 3TC + DTG,\ntwo patients were using ABC + 3TC + LPV/r, and one was taking\nABC + 3TC + ATV/r. Of those patients, one had never used a DTG-based\nregimen but had a history of using TDF and 3TC drugs. Patient MC-243 was\nalready receiving a second line PI-containing regimen, when switching to\nDTG, suggesting this patient had failed TDF + 3TC + EFV, and might have\nalready accumulated TDF and 3TC resistance. This makes the\nDTG-containing regimen TLD particularly vulnerable when used after\nfailure of a first line therapy in Tanzania, where first line failure\nmay not have been diagnosed at the time of the switch. The risk of using\nfunctional monotherapy is then too high. One patient, CR-063, had not\nyet been on a dolutegravir-based regimen. Two patients, CR-119 and\nMC-400, failed their DTG-containing regimen and were already switched to\na protease inhibitor-containing therapy when sampled (Table ​ (Table2 2\n).\n\n### HIV drug resistance (HIVDR)-associated mutations\n\nAmong NRTI resistance mutations, M184V was the most common 9/23 while\nfor NNRTIs, A98G, G190A, and K103N was the most common 5/23.\nFurthermore, for INSTIs, E138K was the common 4/30 genotyped mutation\n(Fig. 2 ). There were no HIVDR against PIs. The most common HIV-1\nsubtype was A: 45.16% (14/31), followed by C 35.0% (11/31) then D 9.58%\n(3/31), and recombinant/ double infection A,D 9.68% (3/31).\n\nFigure 2\n\nPatterns of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR)-associated mutations. Mutations\nagainst integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) ( **a** ).\nMutations against nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (\n**b** ) and, mutations against non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors (NNRTIs) ( **c** ).\n\n### Surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 subtypes\n\nOut of 33 samples eligible for genotyping, 93.94% (31/33) samples were\nsuccessfully genotyped in at least one genomic region, while 66.67%\n(22/33) were successfully genotyped in all genomic regions tested,\nprotease, reverse transcriptase and integrase (Fig. 1 and Table ​\nTable3). 3 ). For one sample, protease and reverse transcriptase were\nsuccessfully genotyped but integrase failed, and for eight samples\nintegrase was successfully genotyped but protease and reverse\ntranscriptase failed. The reason for this high protease and reverse\ntranscriptase (PRRT) failure rate is not clear, viral load was very high\nin most of them. In almost half of the genotyped patients (13 of 31),\nsurveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) were detected (Table ​\n(Table3). 3 ). Five SDRMs (T66I, G118R, E138K, G140A, Q148K) associated\nwith INSTI resistance were detected, of which E138K was the most common\n4/30.\n\n### Prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs)\n\nIn total 23 sequences were analyzed for protease and reverse\ntranscriptase (PRRT) mutations (Table ​ (Table4). 4 ). Of which 13\nsequences contained RT SDRMs (56.5%). Thirty sequences were analyzed for\nintegrase where 3 sequences (10.08%) contained INSTI SDRMs. Worrying is\nthat for those samples where full genotypic information was available\n(n = 22), all three with INSTI SDRMs also had NRTI and NNRTI SDRMs,\nadding up to almost 14%.\n\n### Drug susceptibility assessment\n\nThe drug susceptibility assessment based on the patterns of mutations\nper patient is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The detection of high-level\nresistance against NRTs and NNRTIs was consistent with patients\\'\ntreatment history. Furthermore, patients with INSTI mutations and high\nlevel INSTI resistance (MC-243, MC-367 and CR-048) had a history of\nusing DTG-based regimen (Table ​ (Table2 2 ).\n\nFigure 3\n\nAntiretroviral drugs resistance and susceptibility profile among the\nsuccessfully genotyped patients samples whose viral loads were ≥ 1000\ncopies/mL.\n\nTo assess whether the estimated susceptibility was relevant for the\nconcurrent treatment regimen, a GSS to the concurrant regimen was\ncalculated for the 22 for whom the full PRRT and INSTI genotype was\navailable (Table ​ (Table5). 5 ). This revealed that 68.18% (16/22) had a\ntotal GSS of ≥ 2.5 towards the concurrent regimen, suggesting that for\nthe majority of patients other factors than their drug resistance\nprofile was causing unsuppressed viral load. For one patient, the total\nGSS was 2.0, but with an active DTG. Careful management and\nconsideration of alternative therapeutic options may be necessary for\nthis patient to maintain effective treatment and prevent further\nresistance development especially to DTG. Three had a total GSS less\nthan 1, and two had a total GSS of 1.5. All three patients with INSTI\nresistance mutations were highly resistant to DTG, the other patients\nare at risk for developing DTG resistance (Table ​ (Table5). 5 ). This\nhighlights the importance of monitoring and potentially adjusting\ntreatment to avoid virologic failure and further increase of drug\nresistance in these individuals. Given that time since HIV diagnosis and\nwhether or not there were other chronic diseases was associated with\nunsuppressed viral load (Table ​ (Table1), 1 ), we added this information\nto the table for illustration purposes.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study aimed at determining the prevalence of viral suppression and\nHIV drug resistance (HIVDR) among a random sample of 600 HIV\ntreatment-experienced adults (18 years and above) living in Ukonga and\nGongolamboto, Dar es Salaam, three years after the introduction of\ndolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART). The survey\nconstitutes a baseline at the study site, in order to inform and\nevaluate upcoming intervention studies. In this survey the prevalence of\nviral suppression (defined by viral load (VL) \\< 1000 copies/ml) was\n94.48%, this is a substantial milestone on the last Joints United\nNations AIDS Programme on HIV/AIDS ^^3^^ (UNAIDS target where 95% of\npeople on ART should have suppressed their viral loads by 2025).\n\nThe high virological suppression rate in the studied area is probably\nlinked to the policy change of replacing non-nucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase (NNRTI)-based regimen by DTG-based regimen\n(tenofovir + lamivudine + DTG or TLD) in first line. This policy change\nresulted in 99% of the surveyed patients taking the TLD regimen. The\ntreatment success rate in our survey is consistent with the recent\nnational representative survey carried out in 2021, in which viral\nsuppression among adults was 96.16% ^^15^^ . The national survey was\nconducted 18 months after DTG introduction, while patients in our survey\nwere on average already three years on a DTG-containing regimen. Prior\nto DTG, viral suppression rate was 87.7% among patients with age between\n15 and 64 years, as documented in the Tanzania national survey of\n2016--2017 ^^41^^ , the last survey before introduction of DTG-based\nregimen in 2019 ^^7^^ . This shows that the introduction of DTG-based\nregimen successfully managed to bring treatment success to the majority\nof treated patients. Previously, Kiekens et al. ^^24^^ described that on\na broader scale, the accessibility of highly potent ART combined with\nsecond-generation integrase inhibitors, which possess a robust genetic\nresistance barrier, presents a novel and encouraging avenue for\ntreatment ^^24^^ . The dependence on new ART options should be\naddressed, especially considering that there are currently limited new\nART medications in development. The focus should be on optimizing the\nuse of existing ART regimens and exploring alternative strategies to\nmanage HIV and prevent HIVDR, rather than anticipating the introduction\nof new drugs in the near future. As Kiekens et al. posit, overreliance\non new drugs is one of the drivers of HIVDR.\n\nWhile treatment success was high, the proportion of those harbouring any\nSDRMs among those with unsuppressed viral load (VL ≥ 1000 copies/mL) was\nalso high (41.39%). Treatment success viral load thresholds are much\nhigher in Tanzania ^^2^^ compared to Western countries ^^44^\\ ,\\ ^45^^\n(which aim for VL \\< 50 instead of 1000 copies/mL). In addition,\nTanzanian guidelines allow HIVDR testing ^^2^^ only for samples with\nunsuppressed viral load. This study adhered to Tanzanian guidelines to\nensure that the study followed local protocols, as the current survey is\nintended to be repeated in the context of local interventions consistent\nwith the healthcare practices and infrastructure in the region. The high\nproportion of SDRM is therefore not surprising. Resistance was most\ncommonly observed against NNRTIs (52.1%) and NRTIs (34.88%) similar as\nin other studies in Tanzanian ^^15^\\ ,\\ ^16^\\ ,\\ ^42^\\ ,\\ ^43^^ . The\nanalysis of PRRT mutations in 23 sequences revealed SDRMs in 56.5% of\nthe studied patients, while no protease SDRMs were detected. This is\nconsistent with the history of treatment guidelines in Tanzania. In the\nperiod 2006 ^^5^^ --2018, the first treatment line included 2NRTIs plus\none NNRTI. PIs were, and still are, mainly used for patients who failed\nthe first line regimen ^^7^^ . Comparatively, the examination of\nintegrase sequences from 30 samples revealed that 10% contained INSTI\nSDRMs. The detected INSTI mutations, T66I, G118R, E138K, G140A, and\nQ148K are associated with reduced susceptibility to DTG. E138K and G140A\nalso affect elvitegravir and cabotegravir, in combination with Q148A,\nG140A reduces the susceptibility to raltegravir and elvitegravir by more\nthan 100-fold while susceptibility to dolutegravir and bictegravir could\nbe reduced by up to fivefold. T66I mainly affects the susceptibility of\nEVG by tenfold, with a minimal effect to other INSTIs ^^33^^ .\n\nThe proportion with INSTI mutations is higher than the previously\ndocumented prevalence of 5.8% by Kamori et al ^^15^^ . This indicates a\npotential increase in the occurrence of INSTI resistance mutations,\nwhich could have significant implications for the effectiveness of\nintegrase-targeting antiretroviral therapies. However, it is important\nto consider the scope and context of both studies when interpreting and\ncomparing these findings. We found that HIV-1 subtype was A: 45.16%\n(14/31), followed by C 35.0% (11/31) then D 9.58% (3/31). Our results\nagree with the findings from the neighbouring country Kenya which\nreported subtype A (70.3%) as the dominant subtypes ^^46^\\ ,\\ ^47^^ .\nThe Tanzanian study revealed subtype C (60.87%), followed by subtype A\n(41.30) were the commonly prevailing subtypes among adolescents and\nyoung adults ^^48^^ . A national representative survey found that C was\nthe predominant circulating HIV-1 subtype in adults, 45.3% followed by\nA, 35.7% ^^15^^ . Globally, subtype C accounts for 48% of worldwide HIV\ninfections, primarily clustered in eastern and southern Africa, while\nsubtype A (12%) and subtype D (2%) constitute subsequent proportions\n^^49^^ .\n\nOur data substantiate the ongoing concern regarding the development of\ndrug resistance mutations in reverse transcriptase, which can compromise\nthe efficacy of antiretroviral therapies given that nucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are the backbone of any regimen,\nincluding ^^8^\\ ,\\ ^42^\\ ,\\ ^43^\\ ,\\ ^50^^ . The most worrying is that\nin our study, 13.63% of successfully sequenced patients' samples for\nPRRT and integrase had triple class resistance; NRTI and NNRTI and\nINSTI. Given that patients had been switched to DTG because of the\npolicy change and not because of treatment failure, the high levels of\nNRTI and NNRTI resistance would indicate that these patients may not\nhave been followed up closely enough to timely switch therapy. This may\nhave contributed to the surprisingly high rate of unsuppressed viral\nload under the DTG-regimen, some with but most without DTG resistance,\nafter only three years of DTG-containing therapy. This was anticipated\nin our previous research when considering the drivers of HIVDR at\nsystems level ^^24^^ .\n\nUnique in our study is that we had treatment information, this helped to\nassess the relevance of the resistance profile for the therapy that the\npatients were receiving, we examined their GSS to the concurrent\nregimen. Surprisingly, 68.18% of patients with unsuppressed viral load\nexhibited GSS values of ≥ 2.5 for their concurrent regimen, implying\nthat factors other than their drug resistance profiles might be\ncontributing to the unsuppressed viral load. This underscores the\ncomplex interplay of multiple factors beyond resistance mutations,\nincluding issues related to adherence, healthcare access, and\npsychosocial aspects ^^24^^ . This multifaceted perspective on treatment\nfailure emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to understanding and\nmanaging HIV treatment outcomes ^^25^^ . Those with a low GSS but an\nactive DTG face the risk of developing DTG resistance. This underscores\nthe significance of continuous monitoring and timely treatment\nadjustments to prevent virologic failure and subsequent resistance\nescalation ^^13^^ . In addition, knowledge about drug resistance\ndevelopment and treatment adherence ^^24^\\ ,\\ ^25^^ are also important.\nThe patients with DTG resistance also exhibited resistance to reverse\ntranscriptase (RT) inhibitors. We may speculate here that DTG resistance\nmainly developed in patients that had already failed their first line\nregimen with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, a failure that might have\ngone undiagnosed. These patients might have accumulated DTG resistance\nbecause they had in fact been receiving functional monotherapy. In\ncountries that switch all first line patients to TLD, this\nDTG-containing regimen may be at risk when first line failure went\nundiagnosed.\n\nDespite its effectiveness, the emergence of dolutegravir resistance\nposes a significant concern in HIV treatment ^^15^\\ ,\\ ^16^^ . In\nhigh-income countries with well-established healthcare systems and\naccess to a diverse range of antiretroviral drugs, the prevalence of\ndolutegravir resistance remains relatively low even years after its\nintroduction (below 3%) ^^51^^ . This can be attributed to regular\ntreatment monitoring, early detection of resistance, and the\navailability of alternative treatment options, which collectively\ncontribute to a more controlled resistance landscape. However, in low\nand middle-income countries, where healthcare resources and treatment\noptions may be limited, the prevalence of dolutegravir resistance\nbecomes more concerning ranging from 1 to 20% ^^52^^ . Factors such as\ndelayed diagnosis, restricted access to resistance testing, and\nsuboptimal adherence to treatment can facilitate the development and\ndissemination of resistance mutations in these settings ^^17^^ . This\nshows how development of HIVDR is context dependent, and battling HIVDR\nhas to be done at a systems level.\n\nIn the regression analysis, we found that patients diagnosed since less\nthan 2 years had lower odds (0.13) of having an unsuppressed viral load\nas compared to those with at least 10 years since diagnosis. This could\nbe attributed to various factors, such as closer monitoring, more\naccessible healthcare services, and timely interventions during the\nearly stages of diagnosis for patients that were diagnosed under the\ntest and treat strategy ^^7^^ . This finding aligns with expectations in\nresource-constrained settings, where recently diagnosed individuals\nmight receive more focused attention and support (unpublished data).\nSurprisingly, patients self-reporting other underlaying chronic disease\nconditions also had lower odds (0.18) of unsuppressed viral load as\ncompared to their counterparts. This finding suggests that patients with\ncoexisting chronic diseases might be receiving more comprehensive\nmedical care and support, which inadvertently contributes to better HIV\ntreatment outcomes. This observation underscores again that HIVDR has to\nbe addressed at systems level.\n\nWhile interpreting the results of our study, it is crucial to\nacknowledge certain limitations that might affect the generalizability\nof the findings. Firstly, our research was limited to the urban patient,\npotentially excluding valuable insights from rural or suburban areas,\nwhere healthcare access and disease patterns may differ. Secondly, we\nexcluded patients who were not living in the study area, while attending\nclinics in the study area. This points to a subset of patients (60%) who\nattend clinics away from the area they live in, also for our study area,\nwe are aware of patients attending clinics in other areas, mostly to\navoid stigma. The absence of these patients in our survey may affect the\nresults. It is not clear whether this may underestimate (those\nexperiencing or fearing more stigma are absent in our survey) or\noverestimate (attending clinics away from where you live may reduce the\nconsequences of stigma) treatment success in our survey.\n\nOur study focused on patients who were on treatment for at least one\nyear (13% had less than 1 year of ART in our study area), which might\noverlook potential differences in disease progression and treatment\nresponse among those with shorter treatment durations. Additionally, by\nonly considering participants aged 18 years and above, we may have\nmissed important aspects of the condition\\'s impact on younger age\ngroups, for whom treatment approaches and outcomes could vary\nsignificantly. Given the low success rate of PRRT genotyping, caution\nshould be exercised when interpreting the genotyping results and drawing\nconclusions based solely on the genotyped data. Our interpretation,\nmostly considered the samples successfully genotyped for PPRT and\nintegrase. Another limitation was that our dataset included information\non the previous treatment regimen only for patients with unsuppressed\nviral loads. In addition, as per Tanzanian guidelines, we were not able\nto assess the presence of HIVDR mutations in patients with a detectable\nviral load below 1000 copies/mL. As a result, we were unable to\nascertain the confounding effect of potential pre-existing HIVDR\nmutations in patients who transitioned to DTG-containing regimen from a\ndifferent first line regimen. Whether and how much this could have\ninfluenced the observation that patients diagnosed since less than\n2 years had lower odds of unsuppressed viral load can therefore not be\nestimated.\n\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis study represents a foundational baseline investigation conducted in\na designated intervention site, providing comprehensive insights into\nviral suppression, HIVDR and assessing GSS as a multifaceted metric to\nevaluate treatment effectiveness. In our study site, approximately 95%\nof patients achieved viral suppression under therapy, successfully\nreaching the last of the 95--95--95 UNAIDS targets. This achievement was\nattributed to the replacement of NNRTIs with DTG in the first-line\ntreatment, which played a significant role. However, it is essential to\nnote that HIVDR mutations, including INSTIs resistance mutations, were\ndetected in this survey. Given that the overall viral suppression rate\nis high, the prevalence of dolutegravir resistance remains low but\nconcerning, reaching already 10% of genotyped patient, all with triple\nclass resistance. Without appropriate interventions, HIVDR could\npotentially threaten the effectiveness of the currently available\ntreatment regimen with INSTIs. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain high\npatient levels of viral suppression and continually survey for HIVDR to\nintegrase inhibitors. The fact that in most of those with unsupressed\nviral load, the estimated activity of the treatment was still sufficient\nto suppress viral replication, shows how important other factors are for\ntreatment success, and that a systems approach is needed.\n\nWe strongly recommend the design and implementation of high-impact\ninterventions to prevent any further increase in HIVDR in both the study\narea and Tanzania as a whole. This action is vital to safeguard the\npotency and effectiveness of this new class of INSTIs. To ensure\nsuccessful interventions, a transdisciplinary human-centered approach\nshould be adopted, examining the problem at a systems level. A systems\napproach offers a holistic vision on the complex issue of HIVDR,\nrecognizing the interconnected nature of medical, social, and systemic\nfactors that contribute to treatment effectiveness. This comprehensive\nstrategy will help address the challenges associated with HIVDR and\nsecure the long-term success of treatment efforts.\n\n## Funding\n\nThis research was supported by VLIR-UOS: grant numbers, TZ2019SIN263\n(South Initiatives), TZ2020JOI032A101 (JOINT), TZ2022TEA530A101 (TEAM),\nand Global Minds Scholarship.

The mean age of the participants was calculated to be 32.21 yr and over half of the patients (n=16) were male and the mean time of HARRT use was 47.69 months.  Standard first-line regimen in Iran is comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI);  drug resistance mutations for the 3 classes of ART (NNRTI, NRTI, and PI) were observed and 4 samples showed resistance to all of them.\nRationale: The paper mentions the patients got standard treatment, and the evidence indicates the presence of mutations associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, suggesting that individuals in the study had received these drug classes prior to sample sequencing.\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI\n\nPMID: 20029816\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: To examine the efficacy of these drugs in Cameroon, where diverse non-B HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant viruses predominate, the reverse transcriptase (RT) viral sequences in patient plasma were analyzed for the presence of mutations that confer drug resistance. Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon.\nRationale: The paper doest not mention in vitro drug susceptibility data or phenotypic data.

Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences.

The\nimportance of this problem stimulates the continuous development of\nexperimental and new computational approaches. The use of computational\napproaches allows researchers to increase therapy effectiveness and\nreduce the time and expenses involved when the prescribed antiretroviral\ntherapy is ineffective in the treatment of infection caused by the human\nimmunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). We propose two machine learning\nmethods and the appropriate models for predicting HIV drug resistance\nrelated to amino acid substitutions in HIV targets: (i) k-mers utilizing\nthe random forest and the support vector machine algorithms of the\nscikit-learn library, and (ii) multi-n-grams using the Bayesian approach\nimplemented in MultiPASSR software. Both multi-n-grams and k-mers were\ncomputed based on the amino acid sequences of HIV enzymes: reverse\ntranscriptase and protease. The performance of the models was estimated\nby five-fold cross-validation. The resulting classification models have\na relatively high reliability (minimum accuracy for the drugs is 0.82,\nmaximum: 0.94) and were used to create a web application, HVR (HIV drug\nResistance), for the prediction of HIV drug resistance to protease\ninhibitors and nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors based on the analysis of the amino acid sequences of the\nappropriate HIV proteins from clinical samples.\n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1. Data Processing\n\nWe used 'genotype--phenotype' datasets, which describe a relationship\nbetween a viral genotype and the phenotypic manifestation of resistance\nto protease, and reverse transcriptase and integrase inhibitors from the\nStanford HIV Drug Resistance Database \\[ 27 \\]. To build models for the\nweb service, we used high quality filtered datasets available for\ndownloading from StHIVdb. To maximize the applicability of the models\nbuilt in our approach, all available subtypes and viral variants of\nHIV-1 were used to model resistance. The total dataset contained 1958\nprotease inhibitor (PI) samples, 1707 nucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors (NRTI), and 1819 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors (NNRTI) samples. The samples are the amino acid sequences of\nHIV enzymes with values representing the levels of phenotypic\nresistance. The experimental level of resistance provided in the dataset\nwas determined using the Phenosense™ test system. The table structure\nfor the three drug groups, PI, NRTI, and NNRTI, derived from StHIVdb\nconsists of a column with unique sequence identifiers and several drug\ncolumns with the phenotypic test results. There are also columns with\nthe HIV enzyme positions and their values for each sequence, followed by\na complete list of the mutations present in the isolate. The\nsingle-letter amino acid code found in the sequences provides\ninformation about the amino acids that are changed in this virus subtype\n(in comparison with a wild-type variant), and there are\nmixtures---positions where the amino acid is not fully resolved during\nsequencing and there are two or three amino acids as possible\ninterpretations. Some of the amino acid changes are represented by\nspecial symbols such as \"#\" (an insertion), \"\\~\" (a deletion), etc.\n\nAll possible combinations of amino acid residues in the position for the\nisolate were used to resolve the mixtures in the position. The different\namino acid residues in the same position in the sequence were changed to\neach of the residues mentioned in the sequence of the specific sample.\nConsidering that all possible combinations in the subtype sequence allow\nfor obtaining the best predictive ability, based on the results of\nprevious studies \\[ 34 \\], this approach led to the appearance of\nidentical sequences with different phenotypic assay results. To reduce\nnoise, the FR values for duplicates were averaged. To develop machine\nlearning models, the samples were divided into two classes, 'sensitive'\nand 'resistant', using the FR thresholds from StHIVdb \\[ 17 \\] provided\nin Table 1 . Resistance of all viral variants was determined for all\ndrugs present in the dataset, which is the reason why the final number\nof samples differs for each drug. The number of samples included in the\nclass of susceptible (S) and resistant (R) variants is shown in Table 1\n.\n\n\n### 2.2. Representation of Amino Acid Sequences Based on k-mer and String Muti-n-Grams Descriptors\n\nWe created classification models using a previously developed method\nthat represented HIV sequences as binary vectors comprising '0' and '1'\nvalues indicating the occurrence of specific peptides (k-mers) in each\namino acid sequence for a given drug \\[ 37 \\]. K-mers are amino acid\nsequences of length k, which are corresponding sequences of the source\nprotein. The study found that generated k-mers have a different\nfrequency of occurrence in resistant and sensitive variants of HIV\nsequences. For each drug, we investigated the relationship between the\naccuracy of the model and the length of the k-mer. We used k-mers of\nlength from 5 to 32 with an overlap of two amino acid residues. Such\ncombinations of k-mer lengths and overlaps allowed us to achieve the\nbest prediction accuracy. In the current work, we used a modified\napproach for building descriptors. In particular, we initially\ncalculated the frequency of occurrence for each k-mer in a whole dataset\nfor a particular drug. We set a frequency threshold of 0.1. If a\nspecific k-mer was identified within the sequence at a frequency lower\nthan the threshold, the vector was added with the value «0», otherwise\nthe value «1» was added ( Figure 1 ). Amino acid sequences were\nconverted using the Python 3.8 programming language.\n\nFigure 1\n\nAn example of generating a binary vector based on 5-mers for an amino\nacid sequence. The color of k-mers correspond to a particular digit in a\nbinary vector.\n\nString descriptors implemented in the MultiPASS 2021 software for\npredicting biological activity based on the naïve Bayes approach have\nbeen applied to the reverse transcriptase and protease sequences of 240\nand 99 amino acid residues, respectively. String descriptors (so-called\nmulti-n-grams) are unique sequences of length from 1 to 15 generated\nfrom the sequences of HIV enzymes. To generate multi-n-grams, each\nsymbol and their neighbors of level 1, 2, up to 15 \\[ 41 \\] were used\nsimilarly to the generation of multilevel neighborhoods of atoms\n(MNA-descriptors) for chemical structures \\[ 41 \\]. In this study we\nselected the optimal level of string descriptors for obtaining the\nhighest prediction accuracy.\n\n### 2.3. Model Development and Evaluation\n\nThe models were built using random forest and support vector machine\nmachine learning methods from the library scikit learn 1.1.1.\n\nRandom forest is an ensemble learning technique that allows the\ncombination of multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and\nstability of the final prediction \\[ 42 \\]. The algorithm creates a\n'forest' of decision trees where each tree uses a randomly selected\nsubset of the available features and training sets, making it more\nresistant to overfitting. During the prediction, the algorithm\naggregates the results from all trees in the forest to produce the final\noutput, with predictions based on majority votes from all trees.\n\nSupport vector machine provides the mapping of the input data from its\noriginal feature space into a high dimensional space where the data can\nbe separated by a hyperplane \\[ 43 \\]. The algorithm identifies the\nhyperplane that maximizes the margin between two classes of data points,\nwith the margin being defined as the distance between the hyperplane and\nthe nearest data points of both classes. The points closest to the\nhyperplane are called support vectors, and their positions determine the\nlocation of the hyperplane that separates the classes.\n\nThese algorithms were selected based on our previous study in which they\ndemonstrate their effectiveness \\[ 37 \\].\n\nHyperparameters were selected using a built-in function from the same\nlibrary. For example, a random forest combination of three parameters\nwas taken into account: function to measure the quality of separation,\nnumber of trees (from 81 to 201), and the maximum number of attributes\nused, which was either the square root of the total number of attributes\nor the base logarithm of two of the total number of attributes. The Gini\nindex and Shannon entropy were considered as functions of the division\nquality assessment. Kernel function hyperparameters C and gamma were\nselected for the optimization of the support vector machine algorithm.\nHyperparameter C determines the balance of bandwidth between classes and\ngap violations, i.e., the appearance of instances on the wrong side or\nin the middle of the band. The gamma hyperparameter is responsible for\nthe individual input of each instance.\n\nThe MultiPASSR program is a specially developed version of MultiPASS\n2021. It uses a Bayesian approach to predict resistance to the main\nanti-HIV drugs similarly to the prediction of the biological activity\nspectra for substances (the PASS program) \\[ 44 \\]. MultiPASSR predicts\nthe probability of samples belonging to the class of resistant samples\n(P ~b~ ) and belonging to the class of susceptible---P ~s~ . The\nprobabilities are estimated by analyzing the frequency of the occurrence\nof the multi-grams contained in a sequence in the sets of sequences\ncorresponding to resistant and susceptible HIV variants.\n\nThe accuracy of the models was evaluated using a five-fold cross\nvalidation (5-fold CV), for which the data for each drug were randomly\ndivided into 5 equal sets. Each dataset then served as a test set, and\nmodel training was provided for the remaining four sets. The models were\nevaluated using sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, precision,\nand AUC metrics as averages on five control sets. The AUC (area under\nthe curve of the receiver operating characteristic) is calculated by\nfinding the area below the curve, which shows the relationship between\nsensitivity and specificity at different thresholds applied to the\nclassification model. The AUC metric shows the overall quality of the\nclassification, independent of the threshold. The value of the AUC\nmetric can be in the range of 0 to 1, where the value of 0.5 corresponds\nto the random prediction of the class and the value of 1 corresponds to\nthe ideal classifier. The AUC metric has a number of advantages because\nit: (1) does not depend on the threshold value of the model used to\ndetermine the class; and (2) is applicable to samples with a large\nnumber of features and non-linear dependencies as well as to unbalanced\nsamples.\n\n\n\n## 3. Results and Discussion\n\n### 3.1. K-mer Based Model Evaluation\n\nWe estimated the k-mer lengths corresponding to the highest balanced\nprediction accuracy for most drugs of each class (PI, NRTI, NNRTI).\nFigure 2 demonstrates the relationship between the balanced prediction\naccuracy and various lengths of k-mers. K-mer length for protease\ninhibitors corresponding to the best models was between 10 and 14 amino\nacid residues ( Figure 2 A). The accuracy of the machine learning models\nwas the highest at length k-mer 20 for lamivudine and stavudine, 21 for\nabacavir and zidovudine, lengths 5 and 6 showed maximum precision for\ndidanosine and tenofovir, respectively ( Figure 2 B). According to the\nbalanced accuracy curve ( Figure 2 C), it can be noted that the peaks\nfor etravirine and rilpivirine were achieved using short k-mers, while\nfor nevirapine and efavirenz, it was necessary to use longer sequences\nto achieve the highest accuracy.\n\nFigure 2\n\nThe relationship between a balanced accuracy and a length of encoded\npeptides for PI ( **A** ), NRTI ( **B** ) and NNRTI ( **C** ).\nExplanation of the abbreviations is provided in Table 2 .\n\nBy analyzing the relationship between the length of the k-mers and the\naccuracy of the models, one may conclude that there are some\nassociations between the distribution of amino acid changes and\nresistance to a particular drug. The k-mers of a specific length serve\nto map the distribution, resulting in the highest value for model\naccuracy.\n\nBased on the results of the evaluation of the models, final models using\nk-mer lengths corresponding to the highest balanced accuracy were\nselected. The average accuracy of the five control sets generated during\n5-fold CV is presented in Table 2 . The algorithm that demonstrated the\nbest performance BA metric was selected for the web-based prediction of\nresistance to each drug.\n\nThe balanced accuracy of protease inhibitors varied from 0.84 to 0.93.\nThe highest accuracy was achieved with nelfinavir, whereas tipranavir\nshowed the lowest accuracy. Of the best eight models, two for\nfosamprenavir and tipranavir were constructed using the random forest\nalgorithm, in the other cases the best result was achieved by the\nsupport vector machine.\n\nThe balanced accuracy for NRTI varied from 0.78 to 0.88. Efficient\nmodels were obtained by random forest for all drugs except lamivudine.\n\nThe best model for NNRTI was obtained for etravirine, with a balanced\naccuracy of 0.84 and an AUC of 0.94.\n\n### 3.2. String Multi-n-Gram Descriptors for HIV-Resistance Prediction\n\nThe string descriptors for enzyme sequences were derived from MultiPASS.\nTable 3 presents the accuracy of models created using string descriptors\nand the naïve Bayes approach implemented in MultiPASSR using 5-fold CV.\n\nWe achieved a reasonable accuracy of HIV drug resistance prediction\nusing the naïve Bayes algorithm with string multi-n-gram descriptors.\nThe accuracy for most of drugs used was comparable to the levels\nachieved by k-mers and previously developed algorithms. In our earlier\nwork \\[ 37 \\], we demonstrated the effectiveness of the naïve Bayes\nalgorithm for predicting HIV drug resistance using short amino acid\nsequences (k-mers). We also recently investigated the feasibility of\nusing multi-n-grams for named entity recognition in scientific texts \\[\n41 \\]. This work demonstrates the applicability of multi-n-grams and the\nnaïve Bayes algorithm for building models to predict HIV drug\nresistance. It should be emphasized that multi-n-grams differ from\nk-mers because they include several substrings of different lengths up\nto a defined threshold (in this work, it is equal to 15) starting from\neach amino acid of the HIV enzyme. This study examines the applicability\nof an algorithm developed for named entity recognition in scientific\ntexts, which has been modified for classifying HIV variants, i.e., drug\nresistance prediction. This observation demonstrates the applicability\nof certain algorithms that can handle highly imbalanced datasets to a\nvariety of biological tasks.\n\nWhen looking at the results of predicting resistance based on the\ndeveloped models, it is possible to make some observations. More\nspecifically, the balanced accuracy generally increases for k-mers\nlengths starting from 9 and gradually decreases beyond length 15. This\nlength is probably sufficient to recognize substitutions that are\nlocated closely to each other. Hence, the V82F/I84V \\[ 45 \\]\nreplacements have a correlation with the stability of all currently\napproved IPs. Replacement L76V is associated with resistance to DRV,\nFPV, and IDV. Moreover, its combination with M46I, I54V, V82A, and L90M\nsignificantly augments resistance to LPV \\[ 46 \\].\n\nAn accuracy of 0.88 for NRTIs was achieved with the best model developed\nfor zidovudine. Zidovudine, the first approved NTRI, continues to be\nused in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for HIV treatment\naccording to Dubois et al. \\[ 47 \\]. The drug is well-studied and used\nin pediatric and pregnant patients. It is well-known that a high\naccuracy rate is associated with the quality of the training dataset.\n\nRegarding NNRTI prediction based on k-mer and string multi-n-grams\ndescriptors for reliable prediction, the descriptors for etravirine and\nrilpivirine were sufficient even with both short k-mers and low\nthresholds of k-mers. However, for efavirenz and nevirapine in both\ncases, the descriptors described a long sequence length. The\nobservations may be partially explained by the chemical structures of\nthe inhibitors. Etravirine, an NNRTI, is a second generation treatment\nfor HIV-1 infection. It is a potent inhibitor that maintains activity\nagainst wild HIV types and is the most resistant among NNRTI subtypes of\nHIV \\[ 48 \\]. The model could be created with high accuracy due to the\nabsence of noise in a small amount of data.\n\nTable 4 presents a comparison of the our results and those from previous\nstudies on building classification models, conducted by Rhee et al. \\[\n49 \\] and Heider et al. \\[ 50 \\]. For comparison, only accuracy metrics\nwere used as balanced accuracy could not be obtained from the source for\nall drugs.\n\nTo estimate the performance of our approach using external test sets,\nfirst, we divided the randomized data set into two parts in a 2:1 ratio,\nwhere two parts were used as training and one part was used as an\nexternal test. For comparison purposes, we constructed training and test\nsets as follows: the training set included the sequences from the\nStanford HIV Drug Resistance Database that came from studies published\nno later than in 2018, while the rest of the sequences (which came from\nthe studies published after 2018) were used as the test set. Here, 2018\nwas used as a threshold because the web-services used for comparison\nwere reported in scientific publications before 2018 and therefore some\nrecently collected sequences might be new for those models. The\nresulting accuracies of prediction are provided in Table 4 separated by\na slash (\"/\") symbol after the original accuracy provided by the authors\nof the corresponding studies. In case we were unable to upload the test\ndataset to the web server due to technical limitations, we only included\nthe accuracy reported by the authors of the cited studies in Table 4 .\n\nWe would like to emphasize that although we provide the prediction\naccuracy using specially constructed training and test sets, these\nresults may be biased because we do not know, which training sets were\nused for building the models for the freely-available web-services and\nwhether the test sets are truly external for these web-services.\nNevertheless, we hope that even such a comparison can be used for\ndetermining the place of our approach among others.\n\nThe quality of the models is high for protease inhibitors. The lower\naccuracy for nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors may be due to both\nthe noisy training data and the sequence processing method, as well as\nthe use of an unfiltered dataset from the Stanford HIV Resistance\nDatabase in the test set (for sequences published after 2018), whereas a\nhigh-quality filtered dataset was used for training. Although the models\nfor nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have\nlower accuracy than expected when the test set of sequences published\nafter 2018 was used, they are still reliable for making predictions\nbased on the results of validation using the division of the high\nquality data set into training and test sets.\n\n### 3.3. WEB-Application\n\nWe developed a freely available web application on the Way2drug Platform\n\\[ 52 \\], based on the constructed models.\n\nThe web application takes the amino acid sequences of HIV-1 reverse\ntranscriptase or protease as an input ( Figure 3 ). The models with the\nhighest prediction performance for each drug were used for prediction.\nAn additional option for predicting results is based on a consensus\nresponse of the models developed using multi-n-grams and k-mers through\nthe logical operator 'AND'.\n\nFigure 3\n\nAn example of the results for predicting resistance to antiretroviral\ndrugs based on the amino acid sequence of reverse transcriptase.\n\nTo improve the results of drug resistance prediction using the web\napplication, the alignment procedure to a reference sequence is carried\nout before the predictions. Alignment is carried out utilizing a\nSmith--Waterman algorithm modified for this purpose \\[ 53 \\]. This\nfeature allows users to input the amino acid sequences of protease and\nreverse transcriptase not limited by the length of sequences used for\nbuilding the models. The amino acid sequences of 99 residues for HIV\nprotease and 240 residues for reverse transcriptase were used for model\ntraining. Longer sequences are shortened to the necessary number of\namino acids, considering the implemented local alignment. If the input\nsequence is shorter than the declared length, it undergoes local\nalignment to the reference sequence of HIV enzymes, and missing symbols\nare considered as deletions. There is some probability that long\nsequences of deletions can provide information about possible sites\nresponsible for drug resistance. Thus, caution is advised when\ninterpreting the accuracy of the prediction in such cases, ideally\ntaking into account additional data.\n\nThe sequences undergo processing according to the aforementioned\nalgorithm, which is based on k-mer frequency. The sequences are\nnormalized, checked for length, and then divided into k-mers, with an\noverlap consisting of two amino acid residues. The length of the k-mers\nwas chosen empirically for each drug based on the quality of prediction\nobtained for k-mer lengths ranging from five to thirty-two. To make\npredictions using MultiPASSR, string descriptors are generated for each\nsequence. This leads to a classification probability that indicates\nwhether the sequence is 'sensitive' or 'resistant' to ARV preparations\nand the researcher can interpret the results of predictions.\n\n## 4. Conclusions\n\nThe development and maintenance of web services for various biological\nand medical tasks are essential for improving convenience of use for\nscientists and clinicians in processing information. The represented\ntool can be used by researchers in drug development and to improve the\neffectiveness of therapy for people with laboratory confirmed HIV\ninfection.\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThis work was financed by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education\nof the Russian Federation within the framework of state support for the\ncreation and development of World-Class Research Centers 'Digital\nBiodesign and Personalized Healthcare' (No. 75-15-2022-305).\n\n\n## Data Availability Statement\n\nThe web service is freely available at http://way2drug.com/hiv-host/hvr\n(accessed on 8 November 2023).

To this end, we conducted comparative analyses of HIV-1 phylogenies derived based on HIV-1 PR/RT (2253–3359 in the HXB2 genome) and pol region (2253–5250 in the HXB2 genome) sequences isolated from 134 HIV-1-infected patients in Cyprus (2017–2019). The HIV-1 genotypic subtypes determined using six subtyping tools (REGA 3.0, COMET 2.3, jpHMM, SCUEAL, Stanford, and Geno2pheno) were compared to investigate the discrepancies generated among different tools. To evaluate the accuracy of defined HIV-1 phylogenies, the samples exhibiting at least one discrepant subtyping result among different subtyping tools in both PR/RT and pol regions or only in the pol region (n = 38) were selected for near-full-length HIV-1 genome (790–8795 in HXB2 genome) sequencing using a newly developed RT–PCR/sequencing assay. The obtained sequences were employed for HIV-1 genotypic subtype determination and subjected to comparative phylogenetic-based analyses. It was observed that 39.6% of the 134 samples presented discrepancies in the PR/RT region, while 28.4% presented discrepancies in the pol region. REGA 3.0 produced the fewest discrepancies collectively in both regions and was selected for subsequent subtyping and comparative phylogenetic analyses of near-full-length HIV-1 genome sequences. The analyses of near-full-length HIV-1 genome sequences identified 68.4% of the 38 ‘discrepant samples’ (n = 26) as belonging to uncharacterized recombinant HIV-1 strains, while 21.1% were circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) (n = 8) and 10.5% belonged to pure group M subtypes (n = 4). The findings demonstrated a significant reduction of 11.2% in discrepancies when pol region sequences were used compared to PR/RT region sequences, indicating that increased nucleotide sequence lengths are directly correlated with more consistent subtype classification. The results also revealed that if the discrepancy in pol region subtyping results persists, then there is a high likelihood (89.5%) that the query sequence is a recombinant HIV-1 strain, 68.4% of which belong to uncharacterized recombinant HIV-1 strains. The results of this study showed that REGA 3.0 presented the best performance in subtyping recombinant HIV-1 strains, while Stanford performed better in defining phylogenies of pure group M subtypes. The study highlights that, especially in populations with polyphyletic HIV-1 epidemics resulting in a high prevalence of recombinant HIV-1 strains, neither PR/RT nor pol region sequences are reliable for the determination of HIV-1 genotypic subtypes in samples showing discrepancies among different subtyping tools, and only near-full-length or full-length HIV-1 genome sequences are sufficiently accurate.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the phylogenetic analysis and subtyping of HIV-1 sequences from patient samples.

HIV-1M has diversified into multiple subtypes, sub-subtypes, and circulating and unique recombinant forms (CRFs/URFs). An unanswered question is why some rare subtypes never reached epidemic levels despite their age. Several studies identified the role of HIV-1M accessory genes nef and vpu in virus adaptation to human hosts and subsequent spread. Other reports also pointed out the pivotal role of gag in transmissibility, virulence, and replication capacity. In this study we characterized the HIV-1 gag gene of 148 samples collected in different localities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) between 1997 and 2013. We used nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the whole gag gene. PCR products were sequenced either by Sanger method or by next generation sequencing on Illumina MiSeq or iSeq100 platforms. Generated sequences were used for subsequent analyses using different bioinformatic tools. Phylogenetic analysis of the generated sequences revealed a high genetic diversity with up to 22 different subtypes, sub-subtypes, CRFs. Up to 15% (22/148) URFs were identified, in addition to rare subtypes such as H, J, and K. At least two amino acid motifs present in the gag gene have been shown to modulate HIV-1 replication, budding, and fitness: the P(T/S)AP and the LYPXnL motifs. Structural analysis revealed the presence of P(T/S)AP in all the 148 sequences with the majority (136/148) bearing the PTAP. Three samples presented a duplication of this motif. The LYPXnL motif was identified in 38 of 148 sequences. There was no clear link between the frequency of these motifs and HIV-1M subtypes. In summary, we confirmed a high genetic diversity of HIV-1M in the DRC. We observed the presence of amino acid motifs important for viral replication and budding even in some rare HIV-1 subtypes. Their impact on viral fitness needs be further evaluated by in vitro studies.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the genetic diversity and structural features of the HIV-1 gag gene from patient samples.

Personalized\nmanagement has the potential to improve pediatric antiretroviral therapy\n(ART), even in the presence of long-term treatment and HIV-1 subtype\ndiversity. We sought to evaluate the effect of HIV-1 mutational\nprofiling on immuno-virological response and ADR among APHI. A\ncohort-study was conducted from 2018-2020 among 311 APHI receiving ART\nin Cameroon. Clinical, immunological and virological responses were\nmeasured at enrolment (T1), 6-months (T2) and 12-months (T3).\nImmunological failure (IF: CD4 #x003C;250 cells/mm ^3^ ), VF (viremia\n≥1,000 copies/ml), and ADR were analyzed, with P#x003C;0.05 considered\nsignificant. Mean age was 15(±3) years; male-female ratio was 1:1;\nmedian \\[IQR\\] ART-duration was 36\\[21-81\\] months. At T1, T2, and T3\nrespectively, adherence-level was 66.4, 58.3 and 66.5%; 14 viral clades\nwere found, driven by CRF02_AG (58.6%); ADR-mutations favored increased\nswitch to second-line ART (16.1, 31.2, and 41.9%, P#x003C;0.0001). From\nT1-T3 respectively, there were declining rates of IF (25.5, 18.9, and\n9.83%, P#x003C;0.0001), VF (39.7, 39.9, and 28.2%, P=0.007), and HIVDR\n(96.4, 91.7, and 85.0%, P=0.099). Predictors of ADR were being on\nfirst-line ART (P=0.045), high viremia at enrolment (AOR=12.56,\nP=0.059), and IF (AOR=5.86, P=0.010). Of note, optimized ART guided by\nmutational profile (AOR=0.05, P=0.002) was protective. Moreover, full\nTenofovir+Lamivudine+Dolutegravir efficacy was predicted in 77 and 62%\nof APHI respectively after first- and second-line failure. Among APHI in\nthis SSA setting, viral mutational profiling prompts the use of\noptimized Dolutegravir-based ART regimens, leading to improved\nimmuno-virological response and declining ADR burdens. Thus,\nimplementing personalized HIV medicine in this vulnerable population\nwould substantially improve ART response and the achievement of the\n95-95-95 goals in these underserved populations.\n\n\n## Materials and methods\n\nA prospective cohort-study was conducted from 2018-2020 among 311 APHI\nreceiving ART in one of the selected health facilities within the '\n*Resistance Evolution among Adolescents in Yaoundé and its surroundings*\n' ( *READY-study* ) in the Centre region of Cameroon. Participants were\nrecruited following exhaustive sampling, and follow-up was performed at\nenrollment (T1), 6 months (T2), and 12 months (T3).\n\n### Sampling method and eligibility criteria.\n\nConsecutive and exhaustive following eligibility criteria.\n\n### Eligibility criteria Inclusion criteria.\n\nAPHI with documented infection route; aged 10-19 years; receiving a\nstandard reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based (RTI-based) first- or\nRitonavir-boosted protease inhibitor-based (PI/r-based) second-line ART\nregimen for at least 6-months; having provided written assent, and\ninformed consent from their legal guardian(s).\n\n### Non-inclusion criteria.\n\nNot formally registered in any ART monitoring system; reported to be\nART-naïve; on a drug regimen not included in the national guidelines; on\ntreatment interruption.\n\n### Exclusion criteria.\n\nParticipants who freely withdrew from the study and transferred out of a\nstudy site before mid- or endpoint.\n\n### Clinical and laboratory procedures.\n\nCD4 cell count was performed using the Pima CD4 (Abbott/Pantech (Pty)\nLtd, Westville, South-Africa) automatic test, and plasma viral load\nmeasurement using the Abbott Applied Biosystem platform (Real Time PCR\nAB m2000RT), with a detection threshold of 40 copies/ml (lower) and\n10,000,000 copies/ml (upper).\n\nGenotypic resistance testing (GRT) was carried out at each time point\namong participants with plasma viral load (PVL) ≥1,000 RNA copies/ml\nusing an in-house protocol as previously described by our working group\n( 10 ) using blood samples stored at -80˚C. The sequences obtained were\nassembled and edited using Recall CDC Atlanta GA USA software and drug\nresistance mutations (DRMs) interpreted using Stanford HIVdb.v8.8;\nSubtyping was done using MEGA v10 for molecular phylogeny.\n\n### Data interpretation.\n\nThe major outcomes were the trends of immune-virological failure among\nAPHI, HIVDR profile, and viral genetic diversity. Adequate immunological\nstatus was defined as CD4 ≥250 cells/mm ^3^ and Immunological failure\n(IF) as #x003C;250 CD4 cells/mm ^3^ ^11^ ; virological success as PVL\n#x003C;50 RNA copies/ml; virological suppression (VS) as PVL\n#x003C;1,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml, and virological failure (VF) as PVL\n≥1,000 RNA copies/ml ( 12 ). Self-reported adherence was evaluated, with\npoor adherence defined as \\> one missed ARV dose within 30 days\npreceding sample collection. Moreover, adequate ART exposure was defined\nas being on an active HAART regimen as per efficacy scores from the\nStanford HIV database v8.8, and respect to previous genotypic resistance\ntest (GRT)-guided switch of ART recommendation was also assessed.\n\n### Statistical analysis.\n\nData were analyzed using SPSS v22 with P#x003C;0.05 considered\nstatistically significant. Chi-square and Fisher\\'s exact tests were\nused for determining associations, multivariate logistic regression\nmodels to identify independently associated factors, and Kaplan Meier\ncurves to examine time to immunological failure and VF, with the use of\na log-rank test to test the significance of observed differences between\ngroups.\n\n### Ethical considerations.\n\nEthical clearance was obtained from the National ethics committee for\nResearch on human subjects № 2018/01/981/CE/CNERSH/SP. A research\nauthorization was obtained from the Chantal Biya international reference\ncenter (CIRCB) directorate and administrative authorizations from the\nstudy sites. Written informed consent and assent were obtained from the\nparents or legal guardians and from the participants respectively.\nConfidentiality and core ethical values were respected. Participants\nwere assigned unique identifiers at enrolment, consent and assent forms\nwere stored in locked cabinets, and data were transcribed into\npassword-protected computers. Laboratory results were freely delivered\nto each participant for improved clinical management.\n\n\n## Results\n\nOverall, 311 APHI were included at the enrolment phase (T1) with 272\nfollowed-up at 6-months (T2), and 243 at 12-months (T3). Majority (53.9,\n54.4, and 56.2%) of participants were females from T1-T3 respectively,\nwith mean age of 15 (±3) years; and median \\[IQR\\] ART-duration of 36\n\\[21-81\\] months ( Table IA ). Median \\[IQR\\] CD4 count was \\[565\n(250-85), 504 (305-776), and 586 (387-811) cells/mm ^3^ \\] from T1 to T3\nrespectively, while median \\[IQR\\] PVL was \\[60(40-24730), 92 (40-13808)\nand 51 (40-2622) RNA copies/ml\\]. There was a statistically significant\ndecline in immunological and virological failure across time points\n(P#x003C;0.0001 and P=0.007 respectively) ( Fig. 1A and B). Elsewhere,\nthere was a decreasing median \\[IQR\\] duration on first-line reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitor-based (RTI) ART \\[36.0 (21.0-81.0), 31.0\n(10.0-55.5), and 23.5 (9.0-60.0) months\\], with a corresponding\nincreased rate of switch to second-line ART, with P#x003C;0.0001 ( Table\nIB ).\n\n### Factors influencing immunological failure.\n\nAt enrolment, younger adolescents were approximately three-times more\nlikely to experience IF (OR=2.90, P=0.0002), with adolescents in early\nclinical stages having five-times increased odds of IF (OR=5.02,\nP=0.0013). Moreover, participants in VF had about 9-fold higher odds of\nIF (OR=8.73, P=0.0001) ( Table IIA ). At 6-months follow-up, early\nclinical stages I/II were protective against IF (OR=0.29, P=0.002), with\nfirst-line participants having decreased odds of experiencing IF\n(OR=0.49, P=0.026). In addition, participants experiencing VF were more\nlikely to experience IF (OR=3.96, P=0.0001). IF at enrolment at\nenrolment was strongly associated to subsequent IF at 6-months\n(OR=10.90, P=0.0001), as well as high viremia at enrolment \\>5log\n(OR=4.71, P=0.0001). Finally, at 12-months follow-up, VF was a strong\npredictor of IF (OR=4.88, P=0.0002), meanwhile, IF at enrolment at\nenrolment appeared protective (OR=0.21, P=0.0003).\n\nAfter multivariate analysis, younger age adolescence; early clinical\nstages (I/II), and VF were independent risk factors to IF at T1, with\nVF, follow-up in rural sites, and CD4 #x003C;250 cells/mm ^3^ at\nenrolment being independent predictors of IF at T2 ( Table IIB ), and\nfinally, VF and IF at enrolment (T1) being an independent risk factor,\nand a protective factor respectively of IF at T3.\n\n### Factors influencing virological failure.\n\nAs concerns VF, at enrolment, younger adolescents were 1.60-times more\nlikely to experience VF (OR=1.60, P=0.047), participants in early\nclinical stages and those in immunological failure had 3.49 and\n8.73-fold increased risks of VF respectively (P=0.017 and 0.0001\nrespectively) ( Table IIC ). At 6-months follow-up, participants from\nrural study sites were 2-times more likely to experience VF (OR=2.08,\nP=0.008). Those in early clinical stages I/II were less likely to\nexperience VF (OR=0.21, P=0.0003), on the contrary, those on first-line\nART were 1.83-times more likely to experience VF (OR=1.83, P=0.0345).\nFurthermore, good adherence to ART decreased the likelihood of\nexperiencing VF, (OR=0.56, P=0.025). IF increased the odds of\nexperiencing VF (OR=3.96, P=0.0001). Participants who were in IF at\nenrolment had increased odds of VF, (OR=2.02, P=0.023) as well as those\nwith viremia at enrolment ≥5 log (OR=5.01, P=0.0001) ( Table IIC ). At\n12-months follow-up, participants with good adherence were two-times\nmore likely to experience VF (OR=2.19, P=0.008). Likewise, participants\nwith IF had a 4.88 increase in likelihood of experiencing VF (OR=4.88,\nP=0.0002).\n\n### Figure 1A.\n\nTrends of Immunological failure. Blue line: decreasing prevalence of IF\novertime.\n\n### Figure 1B.\n\nTrends of virological failure. Orange line: declining prevalence of VF\novertime.\n\nAfter multivariate analyses, IF was the lone predictor of VF at\nenrolment and at 12-months follow-up, while being on first-line ART, IF,\nand viremia at enrolment \\>5log, were independent predictors of VF at\n6-months; with early clinical stages I/II, and good therapeutic\nadherence being protective factors ( Table IID ).\n\nDespite absence of statistical significance, decreasing rates (95% CI)\nof overall HIVDR of 54/56, 96.4% (87.5-99.6%); 88/96, 91.7%\n(84.2-96.3%); and 51/60, 85.0% (73.4-92.9%) from T1-T3 respectively were\nobserved among participants in VF, with P=0.099 ( Fig. 1C ). According\nto antiretroviral drug classes, HIVDR was highest in primary NNRTIs,\n96.4% (87.5-99.6%), 88.5% (80.4-94.1%), and 85.0% (73.4-92.9%) from\nT1-T3 respectively ( Fig. 1D ). Assessment of adequate ART exposure and\nrespect of previous GRT-based ART regimen recommendation showed that;\n25.0% (16.7-34.9%), and 36.7% (24.6-50.1%) were on adequate ART regimen,\nwith corresponding 34.4% (25.0-44.8%) and 55.0% (41.6-67.9%) being\nexposed to an ART regimen that respected previous GRT-based ART regimen\nrecommendation at T2 and T3 respectively.\n\n### Factors influencing HIVDR.\n\nAt enrolment, being on first-line ART was significantly associated to\nHIVDR (P=0.005). At 6-months follow-up, participants who experienced IF\n(P=0.037), and high viremia (OR=12.56, P=0.0004) at at enrolmentwere\nmore likely to experience HIVDR. Conversely, good adherence to ART\n(P=0.031), adequate ART regimen (P#x003C;0.0001), and GRT-guided switch\n(P#x003C;0.0001), were protective factors against HIVDR. At 12-months\nfollow-up, participants on first line ART had five-times higher odds of\nexperiencing HIVDR (OR=5.29, P=0.021); with those in IF having\nfive-times increased risk of HIVDR (OR=5.86, P=0.021). Meanwhile, being\non adequate ART (OR=0.05, P=0.0004), and respect of previous GRT-guided\nART switch (OR=0.12, P=0.027), decreased the odds of experiencing HIVDR\n( Table III ).\n\n### Figure 1C.\n\nTrends of HIVDR across time points. Blue line: decreasing trend of HIVDR\novertime.\n\n### Figure 1D.\n\nTrends of HIV drug resistance with respect to antiretroviral drug\nclasses.\n\nFollowing multivariate analyses, being on first-line ART (P=0.045) at\nenrolment remained an independent predictor of HIVDR. At 6-months,\nadequate ART (P=0.00002) was protective against HIVDR. At 12-months\nfollow-up, being on first-line ART (P=0.007), and IF (P=0.010) were\nindependent predictors of HIVDR while adequate ART (P=0.002) was a\nprotective factor.\n\n### HIV-1 genetic diversity.\n\nWe observed a great diversity of HIV-1 genotypes with CRF02_AG\npredominance from T1-T3 with respective proportions of 69.1% (38/55),\n59.4% (57/96), and 58.3% (35/60), followed by the pure subtypes F2 (7.3,\n9.4, and 11.7%), A/A1 (9.1, 6.3, and 10.0%), and G (5.5, 6.3, and 6.7%).\n\n### Distribution of time to end-point events.\n\nThe median (95% CI) survival times from ART initiation to the\nidentification of virological failure (PVL ≥1,000 RNA copies/ml) and\nimmunological failure (#x003C;250 cells/mm ^3^ ) by Kaplan-Meier plot\nwere 69.00 (56.96-81.04), and 58.00 (52.81-63.18) months respectively;\nwith P=0.017 (Fig. 2A).\n\n### Predictive efficacy of TLD.\n\nConsidered effective were ARVs with susceptibility scores #x003C;30\naccording to the Stanford HIVDR database. For participants on 1st line\nRTI-based regimens, TDF showed 76.6% (95% CI: 67.5-84.3) efficacy; AZT\npreserved 58.9% (48.9-68.3) efficacy; ABC preserved 41.1% (31.7-51.1)\nefficacy, and 3TC conserved 14.0% (8.1-22.1) efficacy. All PI/r\npreserved high levels of efficacy, that is, 98.1% (93.4-99.8) for LPV/r\nand ATV/r; and finally 96.3% (90.7-98.9) for DRV/r. There was a similar\ndistribution of drug efficacies among those on 2nd line PI/r based\nregimens, with 61.8% (43.6-77.8) TDF and AZT efficacies, 52.9%\n(35.1-70.2) and 20.6% (8.7-37.9) ABC and 3TC efficacies respectively.\nSimilar high efficacy was observed with DRV/r 100% (89.7-100.0), as well\nas LPV/r and ATV/r 88.2% (72.6-96.7)%. Therefore, on account of the\nefficacy of TDF after first- and second-line exposure (76.6 and 61.8%\nrespectively), the presence of the 3TC-favored M184V mutation that\nrenders TDF hyperactive (hence 3TC is not contraindicated despite its\nlow efficacy scores, 14.0 and 20.6%), and the non-exposure to integrase\nstrand transfer inhibitors (and thus potential full efficacy of\nDolutegravir), full TLD efficacy was predicted in 77 and 62% of APHI\nrespectively after RTI-based first- and PI/r based second-line exposure.\n\n### Proposal for follow-up of APHIs.\n\nAt the end of this evaluation; follow-up in rural sites (OR=2.16,\nP=0.007), being on 1st line RTI-based ART (OR=1.92, P=0.024), and IF\n(OR=4.51, P=0.0001) were risk factors of VF ( Table IIE ). Conversely,\ngood adherence (OR=0.46, P=0.005), and early clinical stages I/II\n(OR=0.43, P=0.036) were protective against VF. Multivariate analyses\nconfirmed IF \\[OR (95% CI)=5.41 (2.25-12.91), P=0.0002\\], and follow-up\nin rural sites \\[OR=2.65 (1.24-5.68), P=0.012\\] were independent risk\nfactors of VF, while being on 1st line RTI-based ART \\[OR=1.94\n(0.99-3.75), P=0.05\\], and having a median duration on ART ≥50 months\n\\[OR=1.83 (0.97-3.45), P=0.06\\] tended towards significance. Meanwhile,\ngood adherence \\[OR=0.36 (0.19-0.67), P=0.002\\] was protective, and\nearly clinical stages \\[OR=0.44 (0.17-1.14), P=0.091\\] tended towards\nsignificance. Moreover, adequate ART \\[OR=0.07 (0.01-0.61), P=0.016\\]\nwas the lone independent protective factor against HIVDR.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nKaplan-Meier analysis of time to immunological failure (CD4 #x003C;250\ncells/mm ^3^ ) and virological failure (PVL ≥1,000 RNA copies/ml) in the\nstudy population.\n\n**Figure 2A.**\n\n### Figure 2B.\n\nFollowing our results, we propose the following algorithm for optimized\nmanagement of adolescents in RLS ( Fig. 2B ).\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nAt the end of the 12-months follow-up, this study showed that at\nenrolment clinical status was acceptable (90% in a less advanced stage\nof disease), with improving immunological and virological responses\n\\[565 (250-851) cells/mm ^3^ and 60 (40-24730) copies/ml\\] from\nenrolment to 586\\[387-811\\] cells/mm ^3^ and 51\\[20-2622\\] copies/ml\nacross 6- and 12-months\\' time points respectively. Moreover, there was\na statistically significant increased rate of switch from RTI-based\nfirst-line to PI/r-based second-line ART following genotypic resistance\ntesting (GRT) recommendations.\n\nFrom T1-T3, early adolescence, early clinical stages, virological\nfailure, follow-up in rural study sites, and experiencing IF during the\nenrolment phase of the study were all independent predictors of IF. This\ncould be favored by adherence issues, non-disclosure of HIV status or\nabsence of rigorous follow-up of the young adolescent by\nparents/counselors, which may be worsened by the long distances traveled\nto access ART services, limited knowledge on HIVDR, and limited\nresources in rural settings. In addition, despite the discordance with\nour current findings, poorer virological control correlates with lower\nCD4 counts and hence resulting in IF thus favoring the emergence of\nopportunistic infections, the severity of which classifies patients into\nmore advanced clinical stages ( 7 , 13-16 ). This discordance could be\ndue to the characteristic poor adherence among adolescents which could\nexplain the adverse association between early clinical stages with IF.\n\nThe high VF rate observed in our study was comparable with those\nobserved in other studies on this population ( 7 , 15 , 17-20 ). From\nenrolment to 12-months follow-up, Immunological failure and being on\nRTI-based first line ART were risk factors for VF, whereas early\nclinical stages I and II, and good adherence to ART were protective\nfactors. These results are similar to those obtained in previous studies\n( 7 , 18 , 21-23 ). The main targets of HIV are CD4+ helper T cells,\nwhich are key regulators of the humoral and cellular immune responses.\nThus, their destruction or depletion by HIV-1 mechanisms that are not\nexhaustively understood render the body unable to defend itself against\nopportunistic pathogens ( 13 ), this combined with ARVs that have a low\ngenetic barrier to HIVDR favor VF. In this regard, the advent of\nDolutegravir (DTG) based regimens which have demonstrated high\neffectiveness even when combined with NRTIs to which DRMs have been\nselected has been regarded as salutary, with significant decreases in\ntreatment failure ( 24 , 25 ). However, despite the high genetic barrier\nof DTG to resistance, care must be taken and adherence reinforced with\nheavily treated patients who have had previous/current acquired drug\nresistance (ADR) to the NRTI backbone in a bid to secure long-term\ntreatment success ( 24 ).\n\nMajority of our study participants were on first line RTI-based ART,\nwith good adherence and median duration on ART of 36\\[21-81\\] months.\nThere was a high prevalence of HIVDR (\\>90%) among participants failing\nART mainly driven by resistance to NNRTIs. Similar results were observed\nin other studies in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) ( 7 , 18 , 21-23 , 26 , 27\n). Of note, sequencing was performed in participants experiencing VF,\nwhich has HIVDR as one of its main causal factors. Independent risk\nfactors favoring HIVDR were being on first line RTI-based ART and\nexperiencing IF. On the other hand, good adherence to ART, and adequate\nART (exposure to a functional tri-therapy) were protective factors. The\nhigh resistance to RTI-based regimens could be because fixed dose\ncombination of NRTIs (such as d4T, 3TC) and NNRTIs (such as NVP) were\nwidely used during early ARV rollout in the Cameroonian HIV programme\nand these guidelines were only renewed as recently as January 2021, with\nthe use of the highly effective integrase strand transfer inhibitor DTG\nin both first- and third-line ART regimens, in combination with an\nNRTI-backbone. Prolonged exposure to these ARVs with low genetic\nbarriers to resistance in our study participants favored the\naccumulation of drug resistance mutations (DRMs), especially to NRTIs\nthat play a key role in HIV tri-therapy in the current treatment\nguidelines ( 28 , 29 ). Ritonavir-boosted PIs (PI/r), and\nDolutegravir-based regimens on the other hand, in surplus to their high\ngenetic barriers to resistance, also have a high degree of tolerance to\npoor observance, low cost, easy dosage, and potency. Despite the minimal\nimpact on therapy effectiveness of DTG acquired resistance mutations in\ncombination with accumulated resistance mutations to the NRTI backbone,\nthere is only limited knowledge regarding the clinical implications of\nthis in an intention-to-treat approach ( 24 ).\n\nMoreover, in the absence of resistance testing at ART initiation,\npatients infected with resistant HIV strains (transmitted resistance)\nare likely to receive a suboptimal ART regimen and will most likely\naccumulate more DRMs. Our results, therefore, underscore the importance\nof viral load measurement as the primary marker of treatment efficacy\nand suggest the importance of switching ART regimens when there is\nevidence of virologic failure, following genotypic resistance testing,\nto prevent the accumulation of HIV acquired drug resistance. Our results\nshow a statistically significant decrease in median time required to\nachieve favorable immune-virological responses, thus indicating that\nclose individualized monitoring, and careful selection of proper HAART\nregimens can improve both effectiveness and sustainability of ART. This\nis especially crucial in a public health scale-up of ART-context,\nwherein large numbers of patients are on the same regimens with fewer\nmonitoring resources for follow-up of individuals and for community-wide\nassessments. In terms of HIV-1 genetic variability, a variety of pure\nsubtypes and genetic variants or recombinants were observed in this\nstudy upon sequencing of the HIV-1 polymerase and reverse transcriptase\ngene regions. Among these, the most prevalent viral clade consecutively\nwas CRF02_AG. This rich genetic diversity and CRF02_AG predominance\nagree with multiple other studies carried out in Cameroon ( 21 , 30-32\n). Worthy of note, HIV-1 subtypes display clade-specific substitutions\nin positions relevant to drug resistance that could result in the\naccelerated emergence of drug-resistant viruses, alter or induce\nalternative pathways of resistance, inﬂuence viral replicative capacity\n*in vitro* , impair the interpretation of genotypic resistance\nalgorithms, and alter drug binding affinity ( 33 ). It is therefore\nimperative to carryout molecular epidemiological surveillance especially\nin hotspots like Cameroon. One of the major limitations of this study\nwas that due to its longitudinal design, loss to follow-up of\nparticipants by the end of the study made it difficult to enroll the\nentire sample population, which may have had an impact on the\nstatistical significance of the study results and the overall impact of\nthe study findings on the target population. Furthermore, limiting\nsequencing only to those samples that had PVL ≥1,000 RNA copies/ml led\nto an underestimation of drug resistance mutations as it is possible\nthat samples with lower viral load also carry DRMs.\n\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn the population of APHI within this SSA setting, there is a\nsignificant decline in immuno-virological failure following personalized\nmonitoring. Of note, virological failure and HIVDR were independently\nassociated with immunological failure and being on first line RTI-based\nART, while optimized ART was a protective factor. Moreover,\nimmunological failure was associated with early age adolescence, early\nclinical stages, virological failure, follow-up in rural study sites,\nand experiencing immunological failure at enrolment. Henceforth,\npromoting personalized ART management and optimized GRT-informed\nDolutegravir ART will improve therapeutic outcome.\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\n**Funding** : The study was financially supported by EDCTP, the European\nand Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership, under the Career\nDevelopment Fellowship-TMA 1027.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 29026792\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: Patients were referred who were on ART treatment above 12 months and immunologically suspicious of treatment failure. The mean age of the participants was calculated to be 32.21 yr and over half of the patients (n=16) were male and the mean time of HARRT use was 47.69 months.  Standard first-line regimen in Iran is comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI);  drug resistance mutations for the 3 classes of ART (NNRTI, NRTI, and PI) were observed and 4 samples showed resistance to all of them.\nRationale: The paper mentions the patients got standard treatment, and the evidence indicates the presence of mutations associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, suggesting that individuals in the study had received these drug classes prior to sample sequencing.\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI\n\nPMID: 38207125\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Methods\nWe performed an in-depth clinical, virological, and pharmacokinetic analysis on the reasons behind and the impact of VF during LA CAB/RPV therapy in 5 cases from the Netherlands. Genotypic resistance testing was performed after the occurrence of VF, and drug plasma (trough) concentrations were measured after VF was established and on any other samples to assess on-treatment drug levels. CAB and RPV drug levels that were below the level of the population cutoff (SQ1) were considered as low drug levels.\nResults\nFive cases who were eligible for LA CAB/RPV experienced VF despite a low predicted risk at baseline. Genotypic resistance testing revealed resistance to either CAB, RPV, or both in all cases after VF was established. In 4 out of 5 cases, low drug levels were observed. The fifth case had adequate drug levels, suggesting other mechanisms behind these low drug levels.\nRationale: The paper focuses on clinical, virological, and pharmacokinetic analyses of patient samples experiencing virological failure during long-acting CAB/RPV therapy. It does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 20029816\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: To examine the efficacy of these drugs in Cameroon, where diverse non-B HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant viruses predominate, the reverse transcriptase (RT) viral sequences in patient plasma were analyzed for the presence of mutations that confer drug resistance. Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon.\nRationale: The paper doest not mention in vitro drug susceptibility data or phenotypic data. It mentions clinical isolates and sequencing of plasma samples.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 35493118\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: Dolutegravir-based regimens were introduced in Malawi in 2019. Since then, a rapid transition from non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)–based (primarily efavirenz) to dolutegravir-based first-line ART has taken place. At initiation of that regimen, 1 patient was ART naïve, 4 had switched from non-dolutegravir-based first-line ART, and 3 from second-line ART. We did not observe protease inhibitor (PI) resistance in any of the samples of the 8 cases. Eighty-seven applications for HIVDR testing of clients on dolutegravir were received between November 12, 2020, and September 2, 2021. Seven were male (88%); the ages ranged from 15 to 46 years, and all were on a single-tablet generic combination of dolutegravir/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine. At initiation of that regimen, 1 patient was ART naïve, 4 had switched from non-dolutegravir-based first-line ART, and 3 from second-line ART. The median duration of viremia on dolutegravir was 12.5 months. Recommendations for next-line regimens were provided based on HIVDR test results and included tenofovir/lamivudine plus a double dose of dolutegravir and/or darunavir/ritonavir.\nRationale: The paper mentions that individuals were on a single-tablet generic combination of dolutegravir/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine. Recommendations for regimens were including tenofovir/lamivudine plus a double dose of dolutegravir and/or darunavir/ritonavir, which include NRTIs, INSTIs, and PIs.\nAnswer: NRTI, PI, INSTI\n\nPMID: 29026792\nQuestion ID: 14\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?\nEvidence: Patients were referred who were on ART treatment above 12 months and immunologically suspicious of treatment failure. The mean age of the participants was calculated to be 32.21 yr and over half of the patients (n=16) were male and the mean time of HARRT use was 47.69 months.  Standard first-line regimen in Iran is comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI);  drug resistance mutations for the 3 classes of ART (NNRTI, NRTI, and PI) were observed and 4 samples showed resistance to all of them.\nRationale: The paper mentions the patients had suspicious treatment failure and they got standard first-line regimen.\nAnswer: Yes"}

In this study, we aim to analyze the real-life\nefficacy and tolerability data of people living with HIV (PLWH)\ninitiated on or switched to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir\nalafenamide fumarate (BIC/FTC/TAF) as first-line treatment.\n\nMaterials and methods: This retrospective analysis was performed in\nHIV-1-positive patients who were initiated BIC/FTC/TAF in the HIV clinic\nbetween June 2020 and June 2022. Patients who received BIC/FTC/TAF for\nat least 12 months were included in this study. Virological suppression,\nlaboratory parameters, side effects, and immunological response were\nanalyzed at one, three, six, nine, and 12 months.\n\nResults: A total of 116 patients, 66 (56.9%) treatment-experienced and\n50 (43.1%) naive, were evaluated within the scope of the study. In the\nnaive patient group, baseline HIV-RNA, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts,\nCD4/CD8 ratio, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values\nwere significantly different in different follow-up months. The number\nof patients with HIV-1 RNA levels below 50 copies/mL was 55.9% in the\nfirst month, 73.7% in the third month, 90.2% in the sixth month, and\n100% in the ninth and 12th months.\n\nConclusion: In our real-life observational study, BIC/FTC/TAF treatment\nachieved rapid viral suppression, maintained viral suppression in\nvirally suppressed patients, and was effective for immunological\nrecovery in both treatment-experienced and naive HIV patients. No\nserious side effects were observed. Our study has proved the potential\nof BIC/FTC/TAF as an important option in the treatment of HIV patients.\n\n\n## Materials and methods\n\nPatients\n\nThis retrospective analysis was performed in HIV-1-positive patients who\nwere initiated BIC/FTC/TAF (either as first-line therapy or as a switch\nfrom a previous regimen (TAF/FTC/EVG/c or TDF+FTC+DTG) at the HIV clinic\nin Antalya, Turkey, between June 2020 and June 2022. Patients older than\n18 years of age, diagnosed with HIV, and receiving BIC/FTC/TAF for at\nleast 12 months were included in this study. A total of 116 patients\nwere included in the study; 50 patients were naive, and 66 patients had\nprevious treatment experience.\n\nPatient records were analyzed retrospectively. For the demographic data\nof the patients, age, gender, coinfection (hepatitis B and syphilis),\ncomorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, chronic\nkidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart\ndisease/hyperlipidemia), baseline HIV-1 RNA, CD4+ T cell count, CD4/CD8\nratio, and regimens used in ART before switching were reported. Other\nlaboratory parameters included baseline estimated glomerular filtration\nrate (eGFR), serum creatinine, hemoglobin, thrombocyte, glycosylated\nhemoglobin (HbA1C), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein\n(HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglyceride, and TC/HDL. These\nparameters were recorded at follow-up visits at one, three, six, nine,\nand 12 months. Data on previous ART, reasons for switching to\nBIC/FTC/TAF, discontinuation, and treatment modifications while on\nBIC/FTC/TAF were collected. Side effects occurring at the start of\ntreatment or during a change of treatment and during the follow-up\nmonths were recorded. We also analyzed the virological suppression\n(HIV-1 RNA ≤ 50 copies/mL) and immunological response (CD4+ T cell count\nand CD4/CD8 ratio) at one, three, six, nine, and 12 months.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthics committee approval was obtained at Health Sciences University\nAntalya Research and Training Hospital in Turkey in accordance with the\n2008 Declaration of Helsinki (registration number: 14.10.2021 16/17).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nPatient data collected within the scope of the study were analyzed using\nthe IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows\nversion 23.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). Frequency and percentage are\ngiven for categorical data, and median and minimum and maximum\ndescriptive values are reported for continuous data. The Wilcoxon test\nwas used to determine the differences between the baseline measurements\nof each treatment group and the control measurements. The results were\nconsidered statistically significant when the p-value was less than\n0.05.\n\n\n\n## Results\n\nA total of 116 patients, 66 (56.9%) treatment-experienced and 50 (43.1%)\nnaive, were evaluated within the scope of the study. The average age of\ntreatment-experienced or naive patients was 34 in both groups. Of the\n116 patients, 102 (87.9%) were male. The demographic and clinical\nfindings of the patients are given in Table ​ Table1. 1 . The age\ndistribution of the patients was homogenous. While male gender and the\ncomorbidity rate were higher in experienced patients compared to naive\npatients, the coinfection rate was found to be lower. It was found that\n93.9% of experienced patients used EVG/c/FTC/TAF and 4.5% used\nDTG+TDF/FTC before BIC/FTC/TAF. Those who were on EVG/c/FTC/TAF were\nswitched medications based on the recommendation of the physician after\nBIC/FTC/TAF was approved in Turkey. Among patients who used DTG+TDF/FTC,\ntheir treatment was switched to BIC/FTC/TAF because of itching in one\npatient, physician preference in one patient, and renal toxicity in one\npatient. Many baseline laboratory parameters of the experienced and\nnaive patient group were found to have similar results. Four PLWH\ndiscontinued BIC/FTC/TAF treatment because one patient had a headache,\ntwo had a rash, and one was pregnant.\n\nThe distribution of side effects observed in the patients included in\nthe evaluation is given in Table ​ Table2. 2 . A total of 53 adverse\nevents were observed in 31 (26.7%) patients in the first month of\ntreatment; the most common side effects were weight gain with 12.1% (14\npatients) and fatigue with 11.2% (13 patients). In the third month of\nthe treatment, 24 side effects were observed in 22 (19%) patients; the\nmost common side effects were weight gain with 8.6% (10 patients) and\nfatigue with 4.3% (five patients). In the sixth month of the treatment,\n21 side effects were observed in 18 (15.5%) patients; the most common\nside effects were weight gain with 6.9% (eight patients) and\nurticaria/pruritus with 5.2% (six patients). In the ninth month of the\ntreatment, 11 side effects were observed in 11 (9.5%) patients; the most\ncommon side effects were weight gain with 4.3% (five patients) and\nweakness and urticaria/itching with 1.7% (two patients). No side effects\nwere observed in the first year of treatment.\n\n\nTable ​ Table3 3 shows the baseline laboratory parameters of\ntreatment-experienced and naive patients and the distribution of\nlaboratory parameters in the first, third, sixth, ninth, and 12th months\nof their treatment. There was no statistically significant difference\nbetween the baseline measurement values in each laboratory parameter of\nthe treatment-experienced patient group and the measurement values in\nthe follow-up months (p\\>0.05). In the treatment-experienced patient\ngroup, although not significant, a decrease in CD4+ T cell count was\nobserved in the first and third months (Figure ​ (Figure1). In 1 ). In\nthe naive patient group, baseline HIV-RNA, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts,\nCD4/CD8 ratio (Figure ​ (Figure2), 2 ), and eGFR values were found to be\nstatistically significantly different at different follow-up months.\nHIV-RNA value became \\<50 copies/mL from the first month and was\nstatistically significant at each follow-up according to baseline\nmeasurement (p\\<0.05). The number of patients with HIV-1 RNA levels\nbelow 50 copies/mL was 55.9% in the first month, 73.7% in the third\nmonth, 90.2% in the sixth month, and 100% in the ninth and 12th months\n(Figure ​ (Figure3 3 ).\n\n### Figure 1\n\n**Treatment-experienced patient group: CD4+ T cells/mL at baseline and\nfollow-up at one, three, six, nine, and 12 months**\n\n### Figure 2\n\n**Treatment-naive patient group: CD4+/CD8+ ratio at baseline and\nfollow-up at one, three, six, nine, and 12 months**\n\n### Figure 3\n\n**Treatment-naive patient group: HIV-RNA at baseline and follow-up at\none, three, six, nine, and 12 months**\n\nThe CD4+ T cell count tended to increase in the follow-up months\ncompared to the baseline measurement, and the measurement value at each\nfollow-up was statistically significant compared to the baseline\nmeasurement (p\\<0.05). While the CD8+ T cell count decreased in the\nfollow-up months compared to the baseline measurement, these changes\nwere statistically significant because the measurements in the third and\nninth months showed a significant decrease compared to the baseline\nmeasurement (p\\<0.05). Since the CD4/CD8 ratio increased compared to the\nbaseline measurement and the eGFR value decreased compared to the\nbaseline measurement, the measurement in each follow-up month was\nstatistically significant compared to the baseline measurement\n(p\\<0.05). During follow-up, no statistically significant change was\ndetected in lipid values compared to baseline.\n\n## Discussion\n\nDue to the success of ART in achieving virological suppression, PLWHs\nare now living longer and developing age-related comorbidities with\nspecific therapeutic and monitoring needs. Success in HIV treatment is\npossible with drug regimens that could potentially increase patient\ncompliance and have fewer side effects than current drugs. In this\nregard, BIC/FTC/TAF as a single-tablet regimen, which has been approved\nby the FDA for patients with low renal and/or bone toxicity, has become\na preferred regimen recently in clinical studies due to its high\nvirological suppression rates and low side effect profile \\[ 13 , 14 \\].\nIn Turkey, studies on BIC/FTC/TAF treatments in real-life settings are\nlimited. Following the approval of this treatment, our center was one of\nthe first to adopt its clinical use in Turkey. We analyzed the use of\nBIC/FTC/TAF for a one-year period, and 56.8% of those who received\nBIC/FTC/TAF were treatment-experienced patients. It was determined that\n93.9% of the previous treatment regimens of the experienced patients\nwere EVG/c/FTC/TAF, and 4.5% of them used DTG+TDF/FTC. Those who\nreceived EVG/c/FTC/TAF were dependent on a medication change upon the\nrecommendation of the physician after BIC/FTC/TAF was approved in our\ncountry. Treatment of those who had received DTG+TDF/FTC was changed to\nBIC/FTC/TDF due to headache in one person and rash in two patients. In\nother similar real-life studies, the reason for the change to\nBIC/FTC/TAF was the simplification of the treatment regimen, which was\nthe most important reason for clinicians to initiate the transition \\[\n15 , 16 \\]. Compared to published studies, the causes of switching\ntreatment to BIC/FTC/TAF are different in our study, and this is one of\nthe points that differentiates our study from other similar studies.\nThis may be due to the high number of patients who previously used a\nsingle-tablet regimen in our clinic and the high rates of virological\nsuppression among patients in treatment in our country \\[ 11 \\].\n\nDiscontinuation of BIC/FTC/TAF was seen in four PLWHs. Rash and headache\nwere adverse effects that resulted in the switch of the treatment\nregime. Central nervous system-related adverse effects, most commonly\nheadache, are observed with this type of integrase inhibitor \\[ 17 \\].\nNonetheless, during the study period, weight gain and fatigue were\nobserved mostly among our patient group. Most studies with BIC/FTC/TAF\nhave shown greater weight gain in the treatment-naive group than in the\nexperienced group \\[ 18 , 19 \\]. In our study, weight gain was found to\nbe equal in the naive and treatment-experienced groups (12% versus\n12.1%); no statistically significant difference was found (p=1.000)\n(data not shown). In a meta-analysis of INSTI use-related weight gain,\nit was found that DTG was the most common, followed by BIC, RAL, and EVG\n\\[ 20 \\].\n\nThe clinical trials of BIC/FTC/TAF were reported to yield high\nvirological responses. A randomized clinical meta-analysis of\nantiretroviral-naive and experienced PLWHs showed that BIC/FTC/TAF was\neffective at week 48 \\[ 18 \\]. In another meta-analysis of five clinical\ntrials, virological suppression rates with BIC/FTC/TAF at week 48 were\nfound to be higher in people who were virologically suppressed at\nbaseline (95%) and had no ART experience (87%), regardless of age \\[ 21\n\\].\n\nReal-life studies of the efficacy of BIC/FTC/TAF have generally been\nconducted in treatment-experienced patients. In a study conducted in\npatients over 50 years of age with treatment experience, virological\nsuccess was observed to continue \\[ 22 \\]. A study in Spain showed that\namong treatment-experienced PLWHs who switched to BIC/FTC/TAF,\nundetectable HIV viral loads persisted at 48 weeks \\[ 23 \\]. In our\ncohort, switching to BIC/FTC/TAF was associated with the maintenance of\nvirological suppression at week 48. In half of the treatment-naive\npatients, HIV-RNA was \\<50 copies/mL in the first month of treatment,\nwhile the viral suppression rate was 100% in the ninth and 12th months.\n\nIn a real-life study from February to October 2021 from Romania, a total\nof 122 treatment-naive patients who started BIC/FTC/TAF displayed rapid\nimmunological and virological response, with an increase to a median\nCD4+ T cell count of 320 cells/mm³ and a decrease in HIV viral load to a\nmedian of 156 copies/mL over the course of follow-up (the duration\nfollow-up was not uniform) \\[ 16 \\]. In another study of naive patients\nfrom large reference clinical centers, suppression rates for\ntreatment-naive patients at six months were lower than 80% but higher at\n12 months (92%) \\[ 24 \\]. In our study, treatment-naive patients with\nHIV-1 RNA levels below 50 copies/mL were 55.9% in the first month, 73.7%\nin the third month, 90.2% in the sixth month, and 100% in the ninth and\n12th months. Our study demonstrated good viral suppression in\ntreatment-naive patients.\n\nIn our study, the median CD4+ T cell count in naive patients was 527\ncells/mm ^3^ , with an increase to over 757 cells/mm ^3^ at 12 months.\nAfter INSTI use, the one-year increase in CD+4 T cells should be\nmodified by 200 cells/mm ^3^ or more per year. It is known that the\nnumber of CD4+ T cells increases annually by 100-150 cells/mm ^3^ on\naverage \\[ 25 \\]. In a meta-analysis of seven clinical studies, it was\ndetermined that the increase in the number of CD+4 T cells in the\nBIC/FTC/TAF arm was higher in treatment-naive patients than in\nexperienced patients \\[ 18 \\].\n\nIn the BIC/TAF/FTC switch study, the median CD4+ T cell count increased\nfrom 568 cells/L at baseline to 610 cells/L after 48 weeks of follow-up.\nA statistically significant increase in CD4+/CD8+ ratio was also\ndetected, from 0.72 to 0.81 \\[ 26 \\]. An observational study of a\nprospective cohort of ART-naive patients comparing two drugs versus\nthree drugs found similar CD4/CD8 ratio recovery rates at 48 weeks\nbetween 2DR with DTG plus 3TC and 3DR based on DTG or BIC \\[ 27 \\]. In\nour study, we observed that the CD4/CD8 ratio increased by 0.6 to 0.8\nand 0.8 to 0.9 at week 48 compared to the baseline measurement in\npatients new to ART and treatment-experienced patients, respectively.\nBIC/FTC/TAF was successful in maintaining a near-perfect immunological\nefficacy in all patients.\n\nOther clinical studies reported different results on serum cholesterol\nand triglyceride of BIC/FTC/TAF. The study by Maggiolo et al. showed\nsignificant reductions in total cholesterol and triglycerides among\nthose who switched to B/FTC/TAF at week 48, with no significant change\nin low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein\n(HDL) cholesterol, or total cholesterol/HDL ratio \\[ 10 \\].\n\nIn a study that analyzed five clinical trials, LDL/TC levels were\nincreased by 2.7%/0.3% in the BIC/FTC/TAF treatment and 5.9%/2% in the\ncomparator regimen \\[ 21 \\]. A real-life study conducted with HIV\npatients over 50 years of age found a significant change in lipid\nparameters at 48 weeks. The median TC was decreased by 15 mg/dL, HDL was\ndecreased by 1 mg/dL, LDL was decreased by 8 mg/dL, and triglycerides\nwere decreased by 18 mg/dL. At the baseline, 179 (51%) patients were\nreceiving lipid-lowering therapy; during the study, 42 (12%) patients\nwere started on lipid-lowering therapy, and 11 (3%) patients\ndiscontinued the therapy \\[ 22 \\]. In our study, we did not detect\nsignificant changes in lipid parameters with BIC/FTC/TAF in both\ntreatment-experienced and treatment-naive patients.\n\nIn our study, baseline eGFR was found to be lower in the\ntreatment-experienced patients than in the naive patients. No\nstatistically significant difference was found in eGFR change in the\ntreatment-experienced patients during the 48-week follow-up period. In\nthe treatment-naive patients, baseline eGFR was higher than in the\ntreatment-experienced patients, and it was statistically significantly\nlower during treatment, except for the third month. In the Bictegravir\nSingle Tablet Regimen (BICSTaR) study, similar to our study, a\nstatistically significant decrease in eGFR was found in treatment-naive\npatients at 12 months compared to baseline eGFR \\[ 28 \\]. In the same\nstudy, a statistically significant decrease was also found in\ntreatment-experienced patients. In a study comparing DTG/3TC and\nBIC/FTC/TAF, a decrease in eGFR was found in the DTG group. It was noted\nthat patients in the DTG group had a decrease in eGFR, probably due to\nDTG\\'s inhibition of organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and thus\ndecreased tubular creatinine excretion. This effect was not observed in\nthe BIC group \\[ 29 \\]. In a switch study conducted in virally\nsuppressed patients over 65 years of age, it was found that no patient\ndeveloped proximal tubulopathy, and changes in renal biomarkers were\nconsistent with the known renal safety profile of TAF \\[ 10 \\]. The\ndecrease observed in eGFR in our study may also be due to the effect of\nBIC known as an inhibitor of renal transporters, organic cation\ntransporter 2 (OCT2), and multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 (MATE1) \\[ 8\n\\]. However, since treatment-experienced patients in this study received\nEVG/c/FTC/TAF before switching to BIC/FTC/TAF and cobicistat is also an\ninhibitor of cation transporters, predominantly MATE1, direct\nconclusions cannot be drawn about the effect of BIC on renal\ntransporters in these patients \\[ 10 \\]. Similarly, in our study, due to\nthe high number of patients using EVG/c/FTC/TAF, there was no decrease\nin eGFR levels in the treatment-experienced patients.\n\nThe limitations of our study are that the analysis was retrospective,\nconfounding factors could not be controlled, and data were obtained from\na single center in Turkey, which limits generalizability to other\npopulations.\n\n\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn our real-life observational study, BIC/FTC/TAF treatment achieved\nrapid viral suppression, maintained viral suppression in virally\nsuppressed patients, and was effective for immunological recovery in\nboth treatment-experienced and naive HIV patients. No serious adverse\neffects were observed. Our study has proved the potential of BIC/FTC/TAF\nas an important option in the treatment of HIV patients.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 35508579\nQuestion ID: 16\nQuestion: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: In this study, samples from 32 children with HIV infection were selected from a plasma bank at Pediatric Hospital “Silvestre Frenk Freund”, Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS).

In this study, we aimed to assess\nthe degree of viral suppression at different thresholds and treatment\nduration after the introduction of dolutegravir-based therapy in ten\npublic hospitals in Sierra Leone.\n\n### Methods\n\nWe used a cross-sectional study design to recruits patients aged 18\nyears or older between August 2022 and January 2023. Statistical\nanalyses were performed using R-software. Logistic regression was used\nto assess factors independently associated with viral suppression. The\nlevel of significance was set at P \\< 0.05.\n\n### Results\n\nOf the 2,253 patients recruited, 1,720 (76%) were women and 1,705 (76%)\nwere receiving a fixed dose combination of tenofovir, lamivudine and\ndolutegravir. The median age and duration of anti-retroviral therapy\n(ART) was 36.0 (IQR, 28.0--45.0) years and 40.9 (IQR, 14.4--79.6)\nmonths, respectively. Using a threshold of HIV RNA \\< 1000 copies/mL,\n1,715 (88.4%) patients on ART for more than 6 months were virally\nsuppressed. Viral suppression rates were higher with dolutegravir-based\n(1,277, 89.5%) than efavirenz-based (418, 86.2%) ART. HIV RNA was \\< 200\ncopies/mL in 1,643 (84.6%) patients or \\< 50 copies/mL in 1,487 (76.6%)\npatients or between 50 and 999 copies/mL in 228 (11.7%) patients. Viral\nsuppression rates at different ART durations (months) were as follows:\n84.2% (≤ 3), 88.8% (4--6), 90.9% (6--12), and 88.1% (\\> 12). Viral\nsuppression rates were higher for patients aged 40 or older (40--50\nyears: aOR 2.05, 95%CI 1.41--3.04, P \\< 0.01; 50--60 years: aOR 2.51,\n95%CI 1.53--4.35, P \\< 0.01; \\>60 years: aOR 2.69, 95%CI 1.28--6.63,\nP = 0.02). Men had 49% lower odds of viral suppression than women (aOR\n0.50, 95% CI 0.38--0.67, P \\< 0.01).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe report a viral suppression rate of 88.4% among patients on treatment\nfor at least 6 months, with higher rate of suppression with dolutegravir\nthan efavirenz. Factors associated with virological suppression were age\nand gender, emphasizing the need for innovative differentiated ART\ndelivery models to optimize viral suppression and achieve the 95%\ntarget.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study design and study population\n\nWe used a cross-sectional study design to collect primary data from\nadult patients aged 18 years or older between August 2022 and January\n2023.\n\n### Study setting\n\nSierra Leone is a low-income country in West Africa with five\ngeographical regions, such as the Western Area and North, East, South\nand Northwestern regions with a population of 7 million in 2015. About\n22% (1.5 million) of its population live in the Western Area \\[ 16 \\].\nThe health system is divided into tertiary, secondary and primary care.\nWhile tertiary care is the highest level of care in Sierra Leone,\nsecondary care services are basic medical, surgical, maternal and child\nhealth services that are provided at district hospitals. Primary care is\nthe lowest level of care and is provided by peripheral health units,\nincluding community health centers (CHC).\n\nAt the time of the study, there were 439 sites reporting data to the\nSierra Leone National AIDS Control Program, of which 215 sites accounted\nfor just 2% of the more than 58,000 PLHIV receiving ART by April 2022.\nThere are 72 large sites where at least 100 PLHIV are receiving ART,\naccounting for 86% of all PLHIV receiving ART in the country.\n\nWe selected health facilities where at least 800 PLHIV were receiving\ntreatment by April 30, 2022 at a time when the study is being planned\nand conducted the study in 10 of these public health facilities. The\nhealth facilities and their PLHIV populations included Connaught\nHospital (3,187), Waterloo Community Health Center (2,999), Rokupa\nGovernment Hospital (2,392), Jenner Wright Clinic (1,341), Princess\nChristian Maternity Hospital (1,101), Lumley Government Hospital (988)\nand 34 Military Hospital (804) in the Western Area, Bo Government\nHospital (2,679) in the South, Kenema Government Hospital (2,374) in the\nEast, and Makeni Government Hospital (2,036) in the North. Two centers\nin the East (Koidu Government Hospital and Well Body Clinic) and two in\nthe Western Area (Wellness Clinic and UMC Urban Center) with at least\n800 PLHIV were excluded because of the distance or delay in obtaining\nconsent to conduct the study. Connaught Hospital, Kenema Government\nHospital, Makeni Government Hospital, Bo Government Hospital and 34\nMilitary Hospital are tertiary/regional hospitals, while Rokupa and\nLumley Government Hospitals are secondary hospitals. The remaining two\nfacilities (Jenner Wright Clinic and Waterloo Community Health Center)\nare primary health facilities.\n\n### Participants selection and laboratory procedure\n\nAfter providing written informed consent, we recruited participants\nnon-randomly as they presented to the different health facilities\nbetween August 2022 and January 2023. Demographic and HIV information\nwere collected from patients using a standardized data collection form\nand cross-checked with clinical records.\n\nApproximately 10 mL of venous blood was collected aseptically in EDTA\nvacutainer tubes and analyzed centrally at the Infectious Disease\nPrevention Center of the 34 Military Hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone.\nThe plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C until\nuse. The HIV RNA was extracted using the TGuide S32 Magnetic Viral\nDNA/RNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China) and the HIV viral load was\ndetermined by HIV-RNA Quantification Kit (Sansure Biotech Inc., Hunan,\nChina) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplification of\nHIV-1 RNA and standards were detected by the probes labeled with FAM\nchannel and Select VIC/HEX/YELLOW channel to detect HIV Internal\nControl. HIV-1 RNA amplification and quantification were performed with\nthe CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories,\nHercules, CA, USA). Thermal cycling conditions used were 95 °C for 1 min\nfor pre-denaturation and enzyme activation; 60 °C for 30 min reverse\ntranscription; 95 °C for 1 min for cDNA pre-denaturation; 95 °C for 15 s\nfor denaturation, and 58 °C for 30 s for annealing, extension and\nfluorescence collection followed by 45 cycles. The threshold for HIV RNA\ndetection is 15 copies/mL.\n\n### Data management and analysis\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using the R-software version 4.2.3\n(R Core Team, Vienna, Austria). Baseline characteristics were summarized\nusing frequencies and medians. The differences in patient\ncharacteristics were assessed using Pearson's Chi-squared test, Fisher's\nexact test and Kruskal-Wallis H test. Multivariable binary logistic\nregression analysis was used to assess factors independently associated\nwith viral suppression. The level of significance was P \\< 0.05.\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Demographic characteristics and HIV details\n\nOver the course of the study, 2,253 patients were recruited. Their\nmedian age was 36.0 (IQR, 28.0--45.0) years. More than a third were\nunder 30 years (758, 33.6%) and nearly half were married (1,080, 47.9%).\nMost were women (1,720, 76.3%), had been on ART for more than 24 months\n(1,434, 63.6%) and were receiving a fixed dose combination of tenofovir,\nlamivudine and dolutegravir (1705, 75.7%) (Table 1 ). The median\nduration of ART was 40.9 (IQR, 14.4--79.6) months.\n\n### HIV viral suppression\n\nOverall, 1983 (88.0%) had an HIV RNA level \\< 1000 copies/mL, regardless\nof the duration of ART (Table 2 ). Using a viral threshold of \\< 1000\ncopies/mL, 1,715 (88.4%) patients who had received ART for more than 6\nmonths were virally suppressed (Table 3 ). The rate of viral suppression\nwas higher in dolutegravir-based therapy (1,277, 89.5%) than in\nefavirenz-based therapy (418, 86.2%) (p = 0.002). There were 1,643\n(84.6%) patients with a HIV RNA \\< 200 copies/mL or 1,487 (76.6%) with a\nviral load \\< 50 copies/mL. Low-level viremia (viral load between 50 and\n999 copies/mL) was reported in 228 (11.7%) patients (Table 3 ).\n\nViral suppression rates were 84.2% for those who had been on ART for 3\nmonths or less, 88.8% for those who had been on ART for 4 to 6 months,\nand 90.9% for those who had been on ART for 6 to 12 months. The viral\nsuppression rate was 88.1% in patients receiving ART for more than 12\nmonths (Table 4 ).\n\n### Factors influencing viral suppression\n\nUsing a simplified multivariate analysis of data from all the 2,253\nPLHIV using a stepwise backward procedure to eliminate non-significant\nfactors (Table 5 ), older age (40--50 years: aOR 2.05, 95%CI 1.41--3.04,\nP \\< 0.01; 50--60 years: aOR 2.51, 95%CI 1.53--4.35, P \\< 0.01; \\>60\nyears: aOR 2.69, 95%CI 1.28--6.63, P = 0.02) had a higher viral\nsuppression rate (HIV RNA \\< 1000 copies/mL). Compared with female\npatients, male patients had 50% lower odds of viral suppression (aOR\n0.5, 95% CI 0.38--0.67, P \\< 0.01). Secondary (aOR 1.96, 95%CI\n1.14--3.57, P = 0.02) and tertiary (aOR 1.39, 95%CI 1.02--1.89,\nP = 0.03) ART services were more likely to result in viral suppression\nthan ART services in primary health care.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nUsing an HIV RNA threshold of \\< 1000 copies/mL, we observed an overall\nviral suppression rate of 88.0% in all PLHIV, regardless of the duration\nof ART and 88.4% in PLHIV treated with ART over 6 months, regardless of\nregimen type and level of care. A similar viral suppression rate of\n87.4% was reported in a national survey in South Africa \\[ 17 \\]. In\ncontrast, the rate of viral suppression in our population was higher\nthan the 76.4% reported by PLHIV in Guinea-Bissau and the 40.9% reported\nin Ethiopia \\[ 18 , 19 \\]. The reasons for the higher viral suppression\nrate in Sierra Leone than other countries are unclear, but could be\nrelated to the introduction of dolutegravir-based regimen to the Sierra\nLeone treatment program in 2020, which may not be the case in Ethiopia\nand Guinea Bissau \\[ 18 , 19 \\]. Dolutegravir-based regimens are\neffective in reducing viral load and optimizing response to treatment \\[\n20 , 21 \\]. A recent study in Nigeria reported a viral suppression rate\nof 97.6% in patients using dolutegravir based therapy \\[ 22 \\]. In our\nstudy, viral suppression to \\< 1000 copies/mL after 6 months of\ntreatment was higher in the dolutegravir-based regimen than the\nefavirenz-based regimen (89.5 vs. 86.2%). Thus, we recommend that our\nHIV program maximize the impact of dolutegravir-based therapy by\naddressing known barriers, such as limited psychosocial counseling and\nchallenges with virologic management, to optimize viral suppression to\nachieve the 95% national and global target \\[ 1 , 14 \\].\n\nIn the WHO and Sierra Leone guidelines, HIV viral load is recommended\nfor all patients receiving ART for more than 6 months, and a viral\nload \\< 1000 copies/mL defines the threshold for viral suppression \\[ 2\n, 23 \\]. The viral suppression rate using this threshold for patients\nwho had received ART for 3 months or less in this study was 84.2%,\nhigher than the 64.6% reported after 6 months of ART in the\npre-dolutegravir era, suggesting that dolutegravir may influence earlier\nviral suppression than the 6 months conventional period \\[ 14 , 21 \\].\nViral suppression in patients on ART between 6 and 12 months is higher\nthan viral suppression in patients taking ART for more than 12 months in\nour study. Although there is no direct explanation for the decline in\nthe rate of viral suppression with the duration on ART, it could\nprobably be due to the recent transitioning of ART regimen from a\npredominantly NNRTI-based regimen to dolutegravir-based regimen or\nperhaps it could be explained by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on\ntreatment adherence in PLHIV staying long on ART and reflect on the need\nto strengthen adherence counselling, psychosocial support and other HIV\nservices during public health emergency \\[ 24 \\].\n\nBetween 2010 and 2016, a follow up study involving 927 sero-discordant\ngay couples with regular condomless anal sex by HIV-positive partner\nwith viral loads \\< 200 copies/mL, and their HIV negative partner\nreported zero transmission of HIV, reinforcing the message of\n'undetectable equals untransmittable (U = U)' and emphasizes the\nbenefits of early HIV diagnosis and treatment \\[ 25 \\]. A viral\nsuppression of \\< 200 copies/mL in 84.6% of patients who have received\nART for more than 6 months in our study warrants the introduction of\nU = U campaigns in Sierra Leone to reduce HIV-related stigma and\ncommunicate the scientific evidence that the transmission of HIV through\nsex or even breastfeeding is non-existent in PLHIV with an undetectable\nviral load \\[ 26 , 27 \\]. Moreover, unlike the WHO recommended threshold\nof \\< 1000 copies/mL to define viral suppression, the International\nAssociation of Providers of AIDS Care recommend a viral threshold of\n\\< 200 copies/mL to define virologic suppression, reinforcing the fact\nthat our study has added to the evidence needed to support global\nadvocacy to lower the threshold for viral suppression \\[ 3 , 28 \\]. It\nis important to note that low-level viremia of 50--999 copies/mL can\ncause virologic failure and inherent mutations that lead to HIV drug\nresistance and poor treatment response \\[ 27 , 29 , 30 \\]. In our study,\n11.7% of patients receiving ART for more than 6 months exhibited low\nlevel viremia. As per the WHO guidelines, patients with low-level\nviremia should receive enhanced adherence counselling and undergo a\nrepeat viral load testing three months later \\[ 2 \\]. Establishing\nfunctional viremia clinics, supported by the sustained availability of\nviral load testing services, is needed for the effective implementation\nof this recommendation in Sierra Leone.\n\nFactors associated with suppressed viral load \\< 1000 copies/mL are\nolder age, female sex and level of service delivery. Similar findings\nwere reported in adolescents in Uganda, where age and duration of\nantiviral therapy are associated with virologic suppression \\[ 31 \\]. In\nEthiopia and South Africa, duration of antiviral treatment is\nsignificantly associated with virologic suppression in children and\nadults living with HIV, respectively \\[ 32 , 33 \\]. To address these\ninherent challenges, HIV programs should employ innovative\ndifferentiated ART models for close monitoring and improved care.\n\nOur study has limitations. First, the study did not assess the status of\nadherence to ART in the different facilities and therefore has no\ninformation on the impact of the treatment interruptions on HIV viral\nsuppression. HIV drug resistance and baseline CD4 count may be important\npredictors of viral suppression but were not assessed due to\ninsufficient resources. The study was only conducted at large sites, and\nthe results may differ from smaller facilities, where staff may be less\nwell trained and care may be different. Finally, we plan to recruit 20%\nof PLHIV from each of the 10 sites between August 2022 and January 2023,\nbut this plan was not achieved in Waterloo Community Health Center and\nKenema, Bo and Makeni Government Hospitals due to the slow flow of\npatients. Thus, of the 19,901 PLHIV receiving ART in all these\nfacilities as of April 30, 2022, only 2,253 (11.3%) were enrolled.\n\nNonetheless, this study provides national insights into the state of HIV\nviral suppression and proffer actionable recommendations on viral load\nmanagement in Sierra Leone and other countries facing similar\nchallenges.\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe report a viral suppression rate of 88.4% among PLHIV treated with ART\nfor at least 6 months, with higher rate of suppression in dolutegravir\nthan efavirenz-based therapy. Common factors associated with virological\nsuppression were age and gender, emphasizing the need for innovative\ndifferentiated ART service delivery models to optimize viral suppression\nand achieve the national target of 95%.\n\n## Funding\n\nThis work was supported by grants from the Beijing Natural Science\nFoundation (grant number 7222171), the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China (grant number 82101837, 31800845) and National Key\nResearch and Development Program of China (grant number 2021YFC2301100).\n\n## Data Availability\n\nThe data for this study is available at Fifth Medical Centre of PLA\nGeneral Hospital, Beijing, China and Ministry of Health of Sierra Leone\nand will be made available upon request.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 37293603\nQuestion ID: 11\nQuestion: What type of samples were sequenced?\nEvidence: We report a case of dolutegravir resistance in KwaZulu-Natal in a 13-year-old male two years after starting dolutegravir. Resistance most likely developed due to poor adherence as a result of psychosocial issues. shows the HIV viral load (VL) and CD4 count timeline after ART initiation with no evidence of viral suppression defined as < 50 copies/mL.1 HIV VL is in log10 copies/mL (right vertical axis) and CD4 count is in cells/µL (left vertical axis).

Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon.\nRationale: The paper doest not mention in vitro drug susceptibility data or phenotypic data.

Annual proportions of recent infections (RI) among newly diagnosed persons infected with HIV-1 in Slovenia during 27 years (1986--2012) were determined using an algorithm consisting of routine baseline CD4 and HIV viral load measurements and the Aware BED EIA HIV-1 Incidence Test (BED test). The study included the highest coverage of persons diagnosed with HIV during the entire duration of an HIV epidemic in a given country/region (71%). Out of 416 patients, 170 (40.9%) had a baseline CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/mm ^3^ and/or HIV-1 viral load less than 400 copies/ml and were characterized as having a long-standing infection (LSI). The remaining 246 patients were additionally tested using the BED test. Overall, 23% (97/416) of the patients were labeled RI. The characteristics significantly associated with RI were as follows: younger age, acute retroviral syndrome, CDC class A and other than C, no AIDS defining illnesses, HIV test performed in the past, a higher viral load, and a higher CD4 cell count. An interesting trend in the proportion of RI was observed, with a peak in 2005 (47% of RI) and the lowest point in 2008 (12%) in parallel with a rise in the numbers of new HIV diagnoses. This study could help promote the idea of introducing periodic HIV incidence monitoring using a simple and affordable algorithm. J. Med.

Standard first-line regimen in Iran is comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI);  drug resistance mutations for the 3 classes of ART (NNRTI, NRTI, and PI) were observed and 4 samples showed resistance to all of them.\nRationale: The paper mentions the patients got standard treatment, and the evidence indicates the presence of mutations associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, suggesting that individuals in the study had received these drug classes prior to sample sequencing.\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI\n\nPMID: 35905753\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Methods: In this prospective cohort study, we monitored 1892 adults transitioning from NNRTI-based first-line ART to the TLD regimen in the Médecins Sans Frontières-supported decentralised HIV programme in Chiradzulu District, Malawi. Eligible adults were enrolled between Jan 17 and May 11, 2019, at Ndunde and Milepa health centres, and between March 8 and May 11, 2019, at the Boma clinic. Viral load at the start of the TLD regimen was assessed retrospectively and measured at month 3, 6, and 12, and additionally at month 18 for those ever viraemic (viral load ≥50 copies per mL). Dolutegravir minimal plasma concentrations (Cmin) were determined for individuals with viraemia. Drug-resistance testing was done at the start of TLD regimen and at viral failure (viral load ≥50 copies per mL, followed by viral load ≥500 copies per mL; resistance defined as Stanford score ≥15).\nFindings: Of 1892 participants who transitioned to the TLD regimen, 101 (5·3%) were viraemic at TLD start. 89 of 101 had drug-resistance testing with 31 participants (34·8%) with Lys65Arg mutation, 48 (53·9%) with Met184Val/Ile, and 42 (40·4%) with lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumerate dual resistance. At month 12 (in the per-protocol population), 1725 (97·9% [95% CI 97·1–98·5]) of 1762 had viral loads of less than 50 copies per mL, including 83 (88·3% [80·0–94·0]) of 94 of those who were viraemic at baseline. At month 18, 35 (97·2% [85·5–99·9]) of 36 who were viraemic at TLD start with lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate resistance and 27 (81·8% [64·5–93·0]) of 33 of those viraemic at baseline without resistance had viral load suppression. 14 of 1838 with at least two viral load tests upon transitioning had viral failure (all with at least one dolutegravir Cmin value <640 ng/mL; active threshold), suggesting suboptimal adherence.

To reduce the emergence of resistant viruses,\nHIV viral load monitoring plays a critical role. However, many resource\nlimited countries have difficulty of monitoring viral load due to\neconomic constraints.There is also limited study regarding viral failure\nin developing countries. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the\nincidence and predictors of virological failure among HIV-infected\nchildren and adolescents on first-line ART Ethiopia, 2021.\n\n### Methods\n\nInstitution based retrospective follow-up study was employed on 492\nchildren and adolescents. Data were collected by trained nurses who have\nexperience working in ART clinics. Data were entered using Epi-data\nversion 4.6 and exported to Stata version 14 for analysis. The\nproportional hazard assumption was checked, and the Weibull regression\nwas fitted. Cox-Snell residual was used to test the goodness of fit, and\nthe appropriate model was selected by AIC. Finally, an AHR with a 95% CI\nwas computed, and variables with a P-value \\< 0.05 in the multivariable\nanalysis were taken as significant predictors of virological failure.\n\n### Results\n\nThe overall incidence rate of virological failure was 4.2, (95% CI:\n3.41, 5.22) per 1000 person-months of observation with 20,169\nperson-months follow-up time. In multivariable analysis living in rural\narea (AHR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.15--3.36), poor adherence (AHR = 2.20, 95%\nCI: 1.24--3.91), lower CD4 Count \\<200 cells/mm3 (AHR = 2.57, 95% CI:\n1.27--5.18) and 201--350 cells/mm3 (AHR = 2.44, 95% CI: 1.28--4.67)\nrespectively, and recent OI (AHR = 4.60, 95% CI: 2.38--8.90) are\nsignificantly associated with virological failure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe incidence rate of virological failure was high. Living in a rural,\npoor adherence, lower CD4 count, and recent opportunistic infection were\nindependent risk factors associated with virological failure. Hence, it\nis better to give priority to strengthening the focused evaluation of\nimportant variables and managing accordingly.\n\n\n## Method and materials\n\n### Study design, period, and area\n\nAn institutionally based retrospective follow-up study was carried out.\nData were collected from April 1--30, 2021 among HIV infected children\nand adolescents on ART between January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019, in\nEast Shewa, Oromia region, Ethiopia. The study was conducted in five\nOromia regional public hospitals namely Adama college referral hospital,\nBishoftu general hospital, Olenchity hospital, Batu hospital and Mojo\nhospital. HIV care and treatment clinic is one of the core parts of\noutpatient activities, all hospitals provide service to Adult and\nPediatric ART. The ART case team in the hospital is composed of\nART-trained physicians, ART-trained nurses, pharmacists, laboratory\ntechnicians, data clerks, and drug adherence counselors. Currently, the\nhospital serves more than 10thousand patients.\n\n### Population, sample size determination, technique, and sampling procedure\n\nThe source population was all HIV-infected children and adolescents aged\n≤ 19 years old on the first-line ART ever enrolled in ART clinics in\nEast Shewa public hospitals and the study population was all\nHIV-infected children and adolescents aged ≤ 19 years old who had been\non first-line ART for at least 9 months in East Shewa public hospitals\nfrom January 2015 to December 2019.\n\nThe sample size was determined by using a single population proportion\nformula with considerations of the following statistical assumption;\nconfidence level 95%, the incidence of virological failure = 5.1% \\[ 34\n\\] (on a study conducted in the Tigray region) and 2% margin of error\n(D). Therefore, the minimum sample size was **465** . By considering\nincomplete patient records, 10% of the initial sample size was added and\nthe final sample size was 511 \\[ 35 \\].\n\nThe total sample size was proportionally allocated for every five\nHospitals depending on their load of patients registered in the study\nperiod. To select study participants, a simple random technique was used\nin each hospital based on their allocation. Finally, 492 patient charts\nthat fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in the analysis.\n\n### Variables of the study\n\nThe dependent variable was the incidence of virological failure, whereas\nthe independent variables were socio-demographic characteristics of\nchildren and adolescents and caregivers (age, sex, residency, disclosure\nstatus, age of caregiver, relationship with caregiver, occupation, and\nmarital status of the caregivers. Anti-retroviral medication-related\ncharacteristics adherence, ART regimen type, ART regimen change,\nisoniazid prophylaxis, and Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis. Clinical and\nimmunological characteristics such as baseline nutritional status,\nbaseline and recent WHO clinical stage, baseline CD4 count, and recent\nopportunistic infection.\n\n### Definition of variables\n\n#### Virological failure\n\nViral failure is defined as a viral load above 1000 copies/ml based on\ntwo consecutive viral loads (VL) measurements, after 6 months of ART\ninitiation and with 3 months of enhanced adherence support following the\nfirst viral load test \\[ 1 \\].\n\n#### Survival time\n\nDefined as the time in a month from the start of first-line ART\ntreatment to the development of virological failure.\n\n#### Event\n\nDefined as patients who developed virological failure during the\nfollow-up time.\n\n#### Censored\n\nDefined when the study participants lost, transferred out, died, and\nwere free from the event during the follow-up time or end of the\nfollow-up study.\n\n#### Adherence to ART medications\n\nClassified as good, fair, and poor according to the percentage of drug\ndosage calculated from the total monthly dose of ART drugs as follows:\nGood (equal to or greater than 95% or ≤ 3 doses were missed per month),\nFair (85--94% or 4--9 doses were missed per month), or Poor (less than\n85%) \\[ 1 , 2 \\].\n\n#### Anemia\n\nWas defined according to WHO criteria (hemoglobin \\<11 g/dl for children\n\\<5 years; hemoglobin \\<11.5 g/dl for children 5--11.99 years;\nhemoglobin \\<12 g/dl for children 12--14.99 years; hemoglobin \\<12 g/dl\nfor females aged ≥ 15 years; hemoglobin \\<13 g/dl for males aged ≥ 15\nyears) \\[ 36 \\].\n\n### Data collection tool and procedure\n\nData were extracted by using an appropriate data extraction tool which\nwas adapted in the English language from national HIV intake and\nfollow-up care after checking the availability of variables in the HIV\npatient registration book. Three nurses who have experience working in\nART clinics were selected for data extraction. The patient's charts were\nretrieved by using the patient's registration number from the database.\nFinally, charts that had a completion date of ART enrollment and date of\nVL measurement were selected and variables also were documented. To\nensure the quality of data, data extraction tools were checked for the\nexistence of variables in the registration format on the patient's chart\nvia a Preliminary chart review of 5% of the sample. Data collectors were\nnurses who had experience working in ART clinics. In addition, data\ncollectors were given training for one day in each hospital before the\nstart of data collection. Dara was extracted from April 1 to 30, 2021,\nfrom patient charts that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The data\nretrieval process was closely monitored by the principal investigator\nand two supervisors. Besides, each data extraction tool was checked\nagain immediately for its completeness. If there were any unfilled space\nhappened during data collection time, the principal investigators were\ncontacted by data collectors to take immediate corrective action.\n\n### Data quality control, data processing, and analysis\n\nThe collected data was entered using EPI data version 4.6 statistical\nsoftware and exported to Stata version 14 statistical software for\nfurther analysis. Descriptive statistics were carried out using tables\nand graphs. The Kaplan Meier failure curve method was used to estimate\nthe time to virological failure. The Log-rank test was used to compare\nSurvival curves between different categories of explanatory variables.\nProportional hazard assumption was checked both graphically and using a\nSchoenfeld residual test which assesses the relationship between the\nscaled Schoenfeld residuals and time. The model of fitness was checked\nby Nelson- Aalen cumulative hazard rate relative to Cox-Snell residuals.\nThe appropriate model for the data was selected based on Akaike\nInformation Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and\nlog-likelihood (LL). The frailty model was taken into account random\neffect model for time-to-event data, by adding a frailty term to handle\nvariations among hospitals. After the selection of our appropriate\nmodel, P-values ≤ 0. 25 in the bi-variable analysis were entered into\nthe multivariable analysis and an adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) with a 95%\nconfidence interval (CI) was designed as P-value \\< 0. 05 was considered\nas statistically significant.\n\n### Ethical considerations\n\nEthical clearance was obtained from the ethical review committee of the\nschool of nursing on behave of the institutional review board of the\nUniversity of Gondar and a Permission letter was obtained from Adama\nmedical college and referral hospitals, Bishoftu general hospitals,\nOlenchity hospitals, Batu hospital's and Mojo hospital's management and\nHIV care clinics focal person to use the secondary data for this study.\nThe name or any other identifying information was not recorded on the\nquestionnaire and all information taken from the chart was kept strictly\nconfidential and in a safe place. An official ethical letter was\nreceived from the University of Gondar's ethical review committee as\nwell as the management of the hospitals where the study was done. As\nthis study used secondary data, we do not have verbal or written\nconsent.\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Description of study participants\n\nA total of 511 medical charts were included of which 19 were excluded\nfrom a study due to missed charts and incomplete data, so a total of 492\ncharts were included in the analysis \\[ Fig 1 \\].\n\nFig 1\n\n**Plot of Nelsen-Aalen cumulative hazard function against Cox-Snell\nresidual obtained by fitting Cox, exponential, Gompertz, and Weibull\nmodels for the virological failure of HIV/AIDS patients on first-line\nART in public hospitals in East Shewa, Oromia region, Ethiopia, January\n2015---December 2019.**\n\n### Socio-demographic characteristics\n\nThe median age of the study participants at ART enrolment was 7.94 with\nan IQR of 7 and half of the study participants were female 50.2%. Three\nfourth 377(76.63%) of the study participant were from urban dwellers.\nRegarding the relationship of caregivers of the study participants\n410(83.33%) were parents and 352(71.54%) of the caregivers of the study,\nparticipants belonged to the \\< 40 years age group. Regarding\noccupational status, 187(38.0%) of the caregivers were housewives \\[\nTable 1 \\].\n\n### Baseline clinical and immunological characteristics\n\nThe majority of study participants were assigned to WHO stage one\n284(57.72%), and had CD4 above 500 copies per cell 310 (63.01%).\nDiarrhea is the most common opportunistic infection 44(21.15%).\nRegarding baseline developmental and functional status, most of the\nstudy participants had appropriate 120(90.91%) and working baseline\ndevelopmental status 306 (85.0%), respectively \\[ Table 2 \\].\n\n### ART and medication-related factors\n\nMore than half of study participants 272 (55.28%) have initiated\nNVP-based NNRTI regimen. About 24 (4.88%) of the study participants had\na history of use of PMTCT (Prevention of Maternal to Child Transmission)\nservice. Of the total 492 patients, 443 (90.04%) and 425 (86.38%) had\nbeen placed on cotrimoxazole and isoniazid prophylaxis respectively.\nAmong the total, 428 (86.99%) of the study participant had good and fair\nadherence. Regarding disclosure status, 198(40.24%) of children and\nadolescents disclosed their HIV status \\[ Table 3 \\].\n\n### Reasons for ART regimens change\n\nIn those patients with antiretroviral regimen changes, more than half\n221 (62.78%) were changed due to ART stock out, 668 (18.18%) due to ART\ntoxicity and 59 (16.76%) due to virological failure \\[ Fig 2 \\].\n\nFig 2\n\n**Kaplan failure hazard curve by (A) recent opportunistic infection (B)\nAdherence status of virological failure among HIV infected children and\nadolescents on first-line anti-retroviral therapy regimen at public\nhospitals in East Shewa, Oromia region, Ethiopia, January 2015 to\nDecember 2019 (N = 492).**\n\n### The incidence rate of virological failure\n\nFour hundred ninety-two children and adolescent HIV patients were\nfollowed for different periods for a total of 20,169 Person Months (PM)\nobservations.

Both the estimated survival curve and\nthe log-rank tests showed that there was no overall difference among the\nsurvival curves of the hospitals (Log-rank Chi-square chi2 = 1.22 Pr\\>\nchi2 = 0.8755) \\[ Fig 4 \\].\n\nFig 4\n\n**Kaplan Meier survival estimate of virological failure among HIV\ninfected children and adolescents on first line ART in East Shewa Oromia\nregion, Ethiopia from January 2015 to December 2019 (N = 492).**\n\nIn the case of the long rank test without adjusting other covariates,\nthere were significant variations between the presence of recent\nopportunistic infection and not having a recent opportunistic infection\n(P\\<0.001) and in those who were in good and fair/poor adherence\n(P\\<0.001) \\[ Fig 5 \\].\n\nFig 5\n\n**Reasons of ART regimens change among HIV infected children and\nadolescents on first-line ART in Oromia regions East Shewa hospitals,\nEthiopia from September 2015 to December 2019 (N = 492).**\n\n### Assessing the proportional hazard assumption\n\nAccording to the Schoenfeld global test, the overall full model\nsatisfies the proportional hazard assumption which states that the risk\nof failure of the study subjects must be the same no matter how long\nthey are followed. (Chi-square = 10.01, p-value = 0.8188) \\[ Fig 6 \\].\n\nFig 6\n\n**Flow chart showing a selection of HIV infected children and\nadolescents on first-line ART in public hospitals in East Shewa, Oromia\nregion Ethiopia, January 2015---December 2019.**\n\n### Model comparison\n\nAfter the proportional hazard assumption was checked, both\nsemi-parametric and parametric proportional hazard models were fitted to\nestimate the survival time to virological failure and identify its\npredictors among HIV patients on first-line ART. Information criteria\n(AIC, BIC) and log-likelihood were used to select the most parsimonious\nmodels for the data set.\n\nBased on this, the Weibull regression with the ( **AIC = 313.15, BIC =\n405.32)** model was more efficient than Cox proportional hazard and\nother parametric models. On the other hand, the frailty effect by\ntreatment hospitals was not a statistically significant variance between\nindividuals among hospitals and also among individuals \\[ Table 4 \\].\n\n\nThe Cox- Snell residuals versus Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard function\nwere obtained by fitting the Cox, Weibull, Gompertz, lognormal,\nlog-logistic, and exponential models to the data. It can be seen that\nthe plot of the Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard function against the\nCox-Snell residuals has a linear pattern making a straight line through\nthe origin of the Weibull model when compared to cox, Gompertz,\nlognormal, log-logistic, and exponential models. This suggests that the\nWeibull regression model provided the appropriate fit for this data set\n\\[ Fig 6 \\].\n\n### Model diagnosis\n\nAfter the proportional hazard assumption was checked \\[ Table 4 \\], both\nsemi-parametric and parametric proportional hazard models were fitted to\nestimate the survival time to virological failure and identify its\npredictors among HIV patients on first-line ART. Information criteria\n(AIC, BIC) and log-likelihood were used to select the most parsimonious\nmodels for the data set. Based on this, the Weibull regression with the\n(AIC = 243.94,) model was more efficient than Cox proportional hazard\nand other parametric models. On the other hand, the frailty effect by\ntreatment hospitals was not a statistically significant variance between\nindividuals among hospitals \\[ Fig 5 \\] and also among individuals \\[\nTable 4 \\].\n\n### Bivariable and multivariable analysis\n\nIn the Bi-variable Weibull proportional hazard model, sex of children,\nthe residence of the child, marital of status caregivers, occupation of\ncaregivers, disclosure to others, disclosure to the child, PMTCT, past\nOI, ART regimen change, adherence, recent OI, baseline hemoglobin,\nbaseline CD4 count, baseline WHO count and recent WHO count were\nsignificantly associated with the incidence of Virological failure.\n\nHowever, in multivariable analysis residence of children, poor\nadherence, lower baseline CD4 count, and recent OI were significantly\nassociated with virological failure \\[ Table 5 \\].\n\nKeeping out other variables constant, the hazard of developing\nvirological failure among children and adolescents living in rural areas\nwas 1.97 times (AHR = 1.97, 95%CI: 1.15--3.36) more likely than those\nwho were living in urban.\n\nThe hazard of developing virological failure in patients that had poor\nadherence 2.20 times (AHR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.24--3.91) is more likely\nthan in patients with good and fair adherence, keeping all other\nvariables constant.\n\nRegarding CD4 count keeping other variables constant, hazard of\ndeveloping virological failure in patients with baseline CD4 count\n(\\<200 cells/mm3) and (200--350 cells/mm3) were 2.5 (AHR = 2.57, 95%CI:\n1.27--5.18) and 2.4 times (AHR = 2.44, 95%CI: 1.28--4.67) more likely\nthan \\> 500 cells/mm3 CD4 count respectively.\n\nMoreover, for those children and adolescents who had recent infections\nkeeping other variables constant, the hazard of developing virological\nfailure 4.6 times (AHR = 4.61, 95% CI: 2.38--8.90) was more likely than\nno recent infection.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe overall incidence rate of virological failure in this study was 4.2\n(95% CI: 3.41, 5.22) per 1000 person-months of observation. The result\nis in line with a study conducted in southern Ethiopia, Tigray region\nand Bahir Dar, with an incidence rate of 4.97 \\[ 21 \\], 5.1 \\[ 34 , 37\n\\] respectively. This similarity could be due to a similar period of\nstudy and cut-off point that had been used to define virological\nfailure. In addition, the HIV/AIDS prevention and control program of\nEthiopia has recently given special attention to people living with\nHIV/AIDS to meet 90% of targets as a national strategy may also have an\nimpact \\[ 11 \\].\n\nHowever, the proportion of virological failure 17.2 (95% CI:\n14.17--20.88) in our study was lower than studies conducted in Kenya\n(28%) \\[ 24 \\], Cameroon 53% \\[ 18 \\], Uganda 38% \\[ 38 \\] and Bahir Dar\n(34%) \\[ 26 \\]. This difference may be due to the difference in the\ndefinition of virological failure used, the cut-off point to define\nvirological failure, and the difference in inclusion criteria and study\nyear. A study conducted in Kenya and Cameroon defines virological\nfailure as the presence of detectable virus in plasma greater than 500\ncopies/ml and 200 copies/ml respectively \\[ 18 , 24 \\]. Comparing our\nstudy, the difference in cutoff point to define virological failure,\nwhich was two measures of a viral load greater than 1000 copies/ml,\nwould increase the number of virological failures in Kenya and Cameroon\n\\[ 14 \\]. Whereas, a study conducted in Bahir Dar and Uganda define\nvirological failure as a single rise in viral load measure above 1000\ncopies/ml, which would increase the number of virological failures in\nthis study \\[ 26 , 38 \\]. Moreover, studies conducted in Bihar Dar\ninclude those children whose only viral load was requested into the\nlaboratory within the study period (Each child sample was considered as\na study unit and Children with complete requisition and plasma samples\nwere used as inclusion criteria). In addition, in a study conducted in\nUganda, death after at least 6 months of treatment was considered an\noutcome (virological failure), and this may further increase the number\nof virological failures. In addition, the difference in the study year\n2011 vs 2019 and the study population (including only those under 12\nyears) may also be another factor for their difference \\[ 11 \\]. This\ncould be explained by the recent scaled-up use of viral load test for\nmonitoring the effectiveness of ART in recent years.\n\nThis result was also higher than the study conducted in Jimma (11%) \\[\n11 \\], the difference might be due to the difference in adherence and\nstudy population. Study participants in Jimma had better adherence than\nin our study area (92.1% vs 86.38%) \\[ 11 \\]. As adherence was a\nsignificant factor in the occurrence of virological failure, the\ndifference in adherence might be a factor for the lower occurrence of\nvirological failure in Jimma. In addition, the difference in study\ndesign was cross-sectional vs follow-up study. Being a follow-up study\ngives you the chance to distinguish between those who developed VF and\nthose who never reached suppression \\[ 14 \\].\n\nFurthermore, the difference in study population reflects the inclusion\nin Jimma of children less than 15 years may also be a factors.\n\nIn this study children and adolescents living in rural areas had HR of\n1.97 times higher than those living in urban. This result is consistent\nwith a study conducted in South Africa and Southern Ethiopia \\[ 39 , 40\n\\]. This can be explained by being in rural areas will have an impact on\nlong transport and time, lack of transportation, poor condition of\nroads, and transport costs imposed on patients when individual visits to\na health center site distant from rural homesteads \\[ 14 \\]. This may\nlead to poor adherence to medication and this in turn increases\nsusceptibility to virological failure \\[ 39 \\]. In addition, those\nliving in the urban area may closely monitor their follow-up and may\nhave more information regarding HIV/AIDS.\n\nRegarding adherence, the present study showed that the AHR of children\nand adolescents who had poor/fair adherence to ART regimens were 2.20\ntimes higher hazard of experiencing first-line virological failure\ncompared to their counterparts. This result is consistent with studies\nconducted in Uganda \\[ 19 , 38 \\], Kenya \\[ 41 \\], southern Ethiopia \\[\n21 \\], central Oromia \\[ 42 \\], Cameron \\[ 18 \\], and Tanzania \\[ 43 \\].\nThis is due to optimal adherence required to suppress virological load\nand improve clinical as well as immunology outcomes \\[ 34 \\]. ART is\nrecommended for HIV/AIDS patients to suppress viral load, maintain high\nimmunity, and prolong survival. However, the success of ART depends on\nadherence to the treatment regimen \\[ 1 \\]. Poor adherence decreases\ndrug effectiveness, which declines immunity this will in turn increase\nthe risk of opportunistic infection and drug resistance \\[ 37 \\]. This\nin turn increases rates of viral replication, high rates of CD4\ndestruction, accumulations of resistant viruses, and faster rates of\ndisease progression. This overall results in virological failure.\n\nAccording to this study, baseline CD4 counts of (\\<200 cells/mm3) and\n(200--350 cells/mm3) are 2.5 and 2.4 times a higher hazard of developing\nvirological failure compared to patients with more than 500 cells/mm3\nCD4 count, respectively. This result is in line with a study conducted\nin Cameroon \\[ 18 \\], Tanzania \\[ 20 \\], and central Oromia \\[ 42 \\].\nThis could be explained by a lower CD4 count will increase the risk of\nopportunistic infection which will further complicate treatment outcomes\n\\[ 25 \\]. HIV/AIDS is a disease that decreases immunity and increases\nsusceptibility to opportunistic infection. So, having low CD4 counts\nbelow a threshold at baseline increases the risk of opportunistic\ninfection. This, in turn, increases the pill's burden, side effect, and\ndrug-drug interaction on child and adolescents, this overall results\ndecrease in their adherence to the treatment regimen and increase the\nlikelihood of virological failure.\n\nOther predictors of virological failure in this study were recent\nopportunistic infection, those children and adolescents with recent\nopportunistic infection were 4.6 times more hazard of failure than those\nwho had no recent opportunistic infection. This is consistent with a\nstudy conducted Bihar Dar \\[ 37 \\]. This can be explained by children\nand adolescents with recent infection increasing the risk of concomitant\nopportunistic infection which in turn lowers their immunity and decrease\ntheir adherence to medication which further complicates the outcome \\[\n37 \\]. In addition, those children and adolescents with recent\nopportunistic infections may have a severe disease like TB, which will\nincrease drug burden and side effects, and decrease drug efficiency.\nThis in turn results in virological failure.\n\n### Limitation of the study\n\nSince the design was retrospective, the study was unable to exhaustively\nexplore all predictor variables that may have an effect on the incidence\nof virological failures such as socioeconomic status of the caregiver,\neducational status, and some laboratory assessments.\n\n\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe incidence of virological failure among children and adolescents on\nfirst-line ART at East Shewa public hospitals was found to be high.\nLiving in a rural, lower CD4 count (\\< = 200 cells/mm3 and 201--350\ncells/mm3), poor adherence, and recent opportunistic infection at\nbaseline were found to be predictors of first-line ART virological\nfailure. Therefore, it is better to give priority to strengthening the\nfocused evaluation on important variables and managing accordingly.\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nFinancial support was obtained from University of Gondar. The funding\ninstitution or body has no role in any activities of the preparation of\nthe manuscript as well as decision to publish.\n\n## Data Availability\n\nAll relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information\nfiles.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 25970253\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Longitudinal trends of recent HIV-1 infections in Slovenia (1986--2012) determined using an incidence algorithm\nAbstract\nResolving dilemma whether the rise in the number of HIV diagnoses represents an actual increase in HIV transmissions or is a result of improved HIV surveillance is crucial before implementing national HIV prevention strategies. Annual proportions of recent infections (RI) among newly diagnosed persons infected with HIV-1 in Slovenia during 27 years (1986--2012) were determined using an algorithm consisting of routine baseline CD4 and HIV viral load measurements and the Aware BED EIA HIV-1 Incidence Test (BED test). The study included the highest coverage of persons diagnosed with HIV during the entire duration of an HIV epidemic in a given country/region (71%). Out of 416 patients, 170 (40.9%) had a baseline CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/mm ^3^ and/or HIV-1 viral load less than 400 copies/ml and were characterized as having a long-standing infection (LSI). The remaining 246 patients were additionally tested using the BED test. Overall, 23% (97/416) of the patients were labeled RI. The characteristics significantly associated with RI were as follows: younger age, acute retroviral syndrome, CDC class A and other than C, no AIDS defining illnesses, HIV test performed in the past, a higher viral load, and a higher CD4 cell count. An interesting trend in the proportion of RI was observed, with a peak in 2005 (47% of RI) and the lowest point in 2008 (12%) in parallel with a rise in the numbers of new HIV diagnoses. This study could help promote the idea of introducing periodic HIV incidence monitoring using a simple and affordable algorithm. J. Med.

The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals. This retrospective study examines genetic sequences and clinical parameters like CD4+ T cell counts and viral load to understand the epidemiological and genetic characteristics of HIV-1 in the pediatric population in Rio de Janeiro.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 29026792\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: Patients were referred who were on ART treatment above 12 months and immunologically suspicious of treatment failure.

Standard first-line regimen in Iran is comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI);  drug resistance mutations for the 3 classes of ART (NNRTI, NRTI, and PI) were observed and 4 samples showed resistance to all of them.\nRationale: The paper mentions the patients got standard treatment, and the evidence indicates the presence of mutations associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, suggesting that individuals in the study had received these drug classes prior to sample sequencing.\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI"}

The patients provided written consent to be\nincluded in the case series. A full file review, extensive search of the\nNational Health Laboratory Services (NHLS) test results database, review\nof pharmacy ART pick-ups, and in-depth interviews with each woman were\nconducted.\n\n### Case 1\n\nCase 1, 32-years-old, was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and\nHIV in 2012. In 2018, with a CD4 count of 6 cells/mm ^3^ , she developed\nfirst-line virological failure and was switched to\nlamivudine/abacavir/lopinavir/ritonavir. She experienced poor adherence\nand a seven-month treatment interruption between January 2020 and July\n2020, following a bereavement and subsequent depression. After\nre-engaging in August 2020, she did not achieve viral suppression. In\nSeptember 2021, with a VL of 91 600 copies/mm ^3^ (log 4.96; Figure 1 ),\nshe was switched to lamivudine/zidovudine/DTG. She continued to\nexperience depression, treatment fatigue, and suboptimal adherence.\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nSummary of the HIV viral load, CD4 count and antiretroviral therapy\ntimeline for each case. (a) Case 1. (b) Case 2. (c) Case 3.\n\nIn November 2022, at nine weeks' gestation, she attended her first\nantenatal care (ANC) visit for an unplanned pregnancy and had a VL of\n169 000 copies/mm ^3^ (log 5.2). Throughout the pregnancy, she reported\nimproved adherence, with no missed doses, vomiting, or drug-drug\ninteractions. Despite this, repeat VLs remained \\> 1000 copies/mm ^3^ .\nAt 22 weeks' gestation, after 17 months on a DTG-based regimen, HIV drug\nresistance testing confirmed high-level DTG resistance ( Table 1 ). At\n27 weeks' gestation, she was switched to once-daily\nemtricitabine/tenofovir/darunavir/ritonavir. Delivery VL was 189\ncopies/mm ^3^ (log 2.2). She was advised to exclusively formula feed and\nlamivudine/zidovudine/nevirapine infant prophylaxis was provided for six\nweeks. Both birth and 10-week infant HIV polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\ntests were HIV--negative.\n\n### Case 2\n\nIn February 2020, Case 2, a 34-year-old woman, presented with an\nunplanned pregnancy at 22 weeks' gestation and was newly diagnosed, by\nself-report, with HIV. She delivered before ART initiation in May 2020,\nwith a VL of 223 000 copies/mm ^3^ (log 5.4; Figure 1 ). The infant was\nexclusively formula fed and given zidovudine/nevirapine infant\nprophylaxis cover for six weeks. Both birth and 10-week infant HIV PCR\ntests were negative. She only initiated TLD in August 2020, with the\ndelay attributed to a combination of psychosocial and systems-related\nissues. By February 2021, she was virally suppressed, at 50 copies/mm\n^3^ (log 1.7).\n\nThe next VL in February 2022, was 225 000 copies/mm ^3^ (log 5.4). In\nSeptember 2022, a second unplanned pregnancy was confirmed at 23 weeks'\ngestation. Responding to the unsuppressed VL of 43 500 copies/mm ^3^\n(log 4.7), she was switched to zidovudine/lamivudine/DTG. She was then\nreferred to an advanced clinical care clinic where multiple adherence\nissues were identified and addressed, and she was switched to TLD.\n\nThroughout this pregnancy, and beyond delivery, despite improved\nadherence of \\> 80% based on regular clinic attendance, pharmacy\nrefills, and an adequate DTG blood level of 0.979 µg/mL, VLs remained\nunsuppressed.\n\nThe infant was exclusively breastfed and was provided six weeks of\nzidovudine and 12 weeks of nevirapine prophylaxis. At 12 weeks\npost-partum, with a VL of 120 000 copies/mm ^3^ (log 5.1), she was\nadvised to wean her infant; zidovudine/nevirapine infant prophylaxis was\nrestarted, and resistance testing confirmed high-level DTG resistance (\nTable 1 ). The infant's birth, 10-week, and 6-week post-breastfeeding\nHIV PCRs were negative.\n\nOnly after receiving resistance results did Case 2 disclose additional\nART experience prior to 2020, with low adherence and multiple treatment\ninterruptions. A retrospective search of the NHLS database at this point\nconfirmed the prior history. Case 2 reported being initiated on a single\ndaily pill which, based on guidelines from that time, would have most\nlikely been tenofovir/emtricitabine/efavirenz (TEE). Between 2015 and\n2020 she reported multiple interruptions but no change in regimen, and\nVLs from that period were never suppressed. She was switched to\ntenofovir/emtricitabine/darunavir/ritonavir in June 2023. A repeat VL in\nSeptember 2023 was \\< 20 copies/mm ^3^ (log 1.2).\n\n### Case 3\n\nIn December 2020, Case 3, a 35-year-old woman, was admitted with newly\ndiagnosed TB and HIV. Her new HIV diagnosis was confirmed through a\nthorough search of the NHLS database, as well as a blood donor card\nindicating her last recorded donation in late 2018. TLD was initiated\ntwo weeks after TB treatment. She was critically ill, with a CD4 count\nof 2 cells/mm ^3^ . As well as TB, she had active cytomegalovirus (CMV)\ninfection and herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and -2 serology was positive.\nThe authors did not have access to the admission record to confirm\nwhether she received treatment for these two conditions. During TB\ntreatment, DTG was prescribed once-daily, in contradiction to guidelines\nrequiring boosted DTG through 12-hourly dosing to compensate for\nrifampicin-DTG drug-drug interaction.\n\nDespite being ART naïve, with \\> 80% adherence (confirmed through\nregular clinic attendance and pharmacy refills) her VLs remained between\n1300 copies/mm ^3^ (log 3.1) and 190 335 copies/mm ^3^ (log 5.3) (\nFigure 1 ), from July 2021 to June 2022. She reported taking\nover-the-counter 'immune boosters' from a pharmacy, the name of which\nshe could not recall. She took these every morning during the period of\nTB treatment, at which point she was taking TLD at night. She reported\nno other medication use, including traditional remedies. In January\n2023, after stopping the 'immune boosters' her VL was 224 copies/mm ^3^\n(log 2.4).\n\nIn May 2023, she attended ANC with an unplanned pregnancy at 26 weeks'\ngestation. Her VL was 2 790 copies/mm ^3^ (log 3.4), and CD4 count 318\ncells/mm ^3^ . During her pregnancy she vomited most mornings but\ncontinued taking TLD at night. Resistance testing was ordered at 27\nweeks' gestation and DTG resistance was confirmed at 29 weeks ( Table 1\n), prompting a switch to once-daily\nemtricitabine/tenofovir/darunavir/ritonavir. After 1 month, her VL was\n59 copies/mm ^3^ (log 1.7) and at delivery was 25 copies/mm ^3^ (log\n1.4). The infant had a negative HIV PCR at birth, was exclusively\nbreastfed, and was provided with zidovudine/nevirapine infant\nprophylaxis cover.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nWe have described the first reported cases of DTG resistance in PBFW in\nthe South African ART programme. In all cases, there were intensified\nclinical support during antenatal and postnatal care, and vertical\ntransmission of HIV was prevented.\n\nIn Cases 1 and 2, suboptimal adherence, failure to screen, diagnose and\nrefer for mental health support, poor clinical management of high VLs\nover prolonged periods, as well as previous ART exposure were likely\ndriving factors for resistance. In Case 3, the lack of DTG boosting\nduring TB treatment is the only identified cause. This is an important\nobservation considering the RADIANT-TB (standard versus double dose\ndolutegravir in patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis\n\\[https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/ NCT03851588 \\]) trial reported no\nsignificant difference in viral suppression or resistance when DTG was\n'unboosted' during TB treatment. ^14^ One possible reason for Case 3\ndeveloping DTG resistance may have been her very high rate of viral\nreplication at ART initiation, with a baseline VL of 5 040 000 copies/mm\n^3^ (log 6.7), in combination with a very low CD4 count. ^15^\nFurthermore it is possible that, although she had good support following\ndischarge from hospital, she had suboptimal adherence due to being very\nunwell and having a significant pill burden.\n\nOne of the cornerstones of comprehensive VTP programmes is avoiding\nunintended pregnancies in women living with HIV. ^16^ One survey among\npregnant women in South Africa in 2019 showed a 51.5% prevalence of\nunintended pregnancies in women living with HIV and engaged in care.\n^17^ It is important to note that all three cases presented with\nunplanned pregnancies, with Case 2 having two unplanned pregnancies\nwithin two years, highlighting an ongoing failure of the South African\nART programme to effectively integrate contraceptive services into HIV\nservices for women of reproductive age. Effective integration of\nreproductive health services with HIV services is particularly important\nfor women experiencing advanced HIV disease and/or unsuppressed VLs\nbecause vertical transmission risks are elevated in the context of\nsuboptimal maternal health.\n\nSeveral key factors influencing ART adherence and VL suppression are\nwell documented in the literature, including medication side effects and\npill burden, substance use, presence or lack of social support, comorbid\nmental health conditions, and duration on treatment. ^18\\ ,\\ 19^ Two of\nthe three cases reported longstanding mental health and psychosocial\nchallenges that persistently undermined their ability to adhere well to\ntheir ART regimens and remained unaddressed during years of routine\ncare. This emphasises the importance of integrating psychosocial and\nmental health support into HIV services. In particular, better\nintegration into antenatal and postnatal care remains a key component of\nsupporting PBFW to achieve and maintain viral suppression during their\nVTP journey.\n\nThese cases demonstrate the difficulties encountered in high-HIV-burden\nsettings, even with supportive clinical and counselling relationships,\nin achieving full, open discussions about prior ART history, adherence\npatterns, and other medication use. In the South African public\nhealthcare setting, some information required to satisfy resistance\ntesting criteria can also be complicated to ascertain. Reasons include\ngaps in the health information systems, including the lack of a\nuniversal unique patient identifier. Persons living with HIV also fear\nstigmatisation upon disclosing treatment interruption. Consequently,\npatients, like Case 2, often preferentially re-engage as new patients\nvia repeat HIV testing. ^20^ It is noteworthy that Case 2 re-engaged\nwith each pregnancy, a common pattern of re-engagement among female\npatients. ^21^ Unfortunately, with increasing reports of DTG resistance,\n^9\\ ,\\ 10^ clinicians in South Africa need to be aware that, although\nDTG is robust, resistance remains a possibility in a small proportion of\nindividuals. This case series adds to the evidence raising concerns that\nin programmatic settings, DTG resistance may be more frequent than\npredicted, particularly in contexts where inadequate adherence support\nand VL monitoring result in prolonged periods of viral non-suppression.\n\nBecause DTG has a high resistance barrier, the current South African ART\nguidelines focus on addressing adherence issues in unsuppressed\nindividuals and provide strict resistance testing criteria. The managing\nclinicians in these cases, although fully aware of the current\nguidelines, had specific concerns related to the risk of vertical\ntransmission and used clinical judgement to proceed with drug resistance\ntesting, despite the cases not meeting all the criteria. Strict\nadherence to the time on ART and previous ART failure (classified as\nTLD2) criteria for resistance testing, would have delayed identification\nof resistance, potentially leading to vertical transmission.\n\n\n### Funding information\n\nThis material is based upon work supported by the United States\nPresident's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) through the United\nStates Agency for International Development (USAID) under Cooperative\nAgreement number 72067418CA00023 to the Anova Health Institute.\n\n### Data availability\n\nThe authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study\nare available within the article.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 36479423\nQuestion ID: 16\nQuestion: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: Case 1\nAn 18-year-old male patient was commenced on ART in September 2010, at seven years of age. His baseline CD4 count was 145 cells/μL. His first-line ART regimens were stavudine/lamivudine (3TC)/nevirapine, followed by stavudine/3TC/efavirenz (EFV), followed by zidovudine/3TC/EFV. Viral load (VL) results were not available until 2014, at which time he was noted to have virological treatment failure. An HIV genotypic resistance test done in January 2015 showed significant nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) DRMs with no protease inhibitor resistance (see Table 1 for DRMs and sensitivity results). In January 2015 he was switched to second-line treatment with abacavir (ABC)/3TC/lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), which was later simplified to ABC/3TC/Atazanavir/ritonavir (ATZ/r). Virological suppression was maintained for the duration of protease inhibitor therapy. In August 2019 he was switched to a single tablet regimen of tenofovir (TDF)/3TC/DTG; his VL was suppressed at the time of switch.\nCase 2\nA 29-year-old female patient was diagnosed with HIV infection in June 2017 and commenced on TDF/3TC/EFV. Her baseline CD4 count and VL are unknown. Three years later, she was switched to ABC/3TC/ATZ/r following virological failure. Four weeks after treatment switch, she developed pulmonary tuberculosis and in error was given rifampicin with ATZ/r for two months. For treatment optimisation reasons, the ART regimen was switched to ABC/3TC/DTG, but DTG was dosed at 50 mg daily with rifampicin for four months instead of twice daily according to current guidelines. The VL at switch to ABC/3TC/DTG is unknown. The clinical response to treatment was poor and she was referred to Newlands Clinic. A VL taken after seven months on ABC/3TC/DTG was 6540 copies/mL, despite adherence counselling. A genotypic resistance test taken 10 months after initiation of DTG showed extensive NRTI DRMs and one major InSTI DRM (see Table 1 for mutations and sensitivity analysis).

The first patient had significant NRTI resistance prior to switching to TDF/3TC/DTG and suboptimal adherence post treatment switch. The second patient also reported suboptimal adherence and may have had sub-therapeutic drug levels of DTG due to a drug interaction between DTG and rifampicin. Known risk factors for incident drug resistance include suboptimal medication adherence, drug interactions, a high baseline VL and active opportunistic infections. A similar case from South Africa has been described, of a treatment experienced patient who developed resistance to DTG after taking DTG 50 mg once a day with rifampicin, instead of the recommended twice daily dosing. Rifampicin is an inducer of the UGT1A1 and CYP3A4 pathways by which DTG is metabolised, resulting in reduced serum DTG concentrations. The current World Health Organization recommendation is to dose DTG at 50 mg 12-hourly for patients taking both medications concurrently.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on 2 clinical cases and genotypic resistance tests from patient samples, but it does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility assays.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 37317505\nQuestion ID: 16\nQuestion: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: she initiated dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (DTG/ABC/3TC) 39 months after diagnosis (M39); however, because of intermittent adherence, she did not experience virological suppression and was subsequently switched to BIC/TAF/FTC because of the smaller pill size while admitted to hospital with esophagitis and a CD4 count of 62 cells/μL (6%) at M59. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was added for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis. Repeat genotyping at M61 showed wild-type virus. She continued to be prescribed BIC/TAF/FTC with ongoing viraemia due to poor adherence. At M79, her CD4 count was 166 cells/μL (11%), viral load was 4288 copies/mL, and genotypic resistance testing captured new reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations: T69D/N, K70E, and T215I, but she could not be contacted to switch her regimen. She discontinued BIC/TAF/FTC on her own at M82 upon learning she was pregnant. She restarted treatment with DTG + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/FTC at M84, before being intensified to darunavir (DRV) + ritonavir (RTV) + DTG + TDF/FTC when diagnosed with cerebral toxoplasmosis at M85. After delivery, she started DTG + rilpivirine (RPV)/TAF/FTC to reduce pill burden but did not achieve virological suppression and died of hypoxemic respiratory failure at M86. She experienced an HIV RNA <40 copies/mL on initial therapy with lopinavir/RTV + zidovudine/lamivudine (AZT/3TC). She then switched to atazanavir (ATV) + RTV + TDF/FTC for simplification at M25 but reported intermittent adherence and experienced episodes of breakthrough viraemia before stopping HIV therapy at M58. Genotyping at M65 revealed the V82I protease mutation along with several genetic polymorphisms in the protease gene (Table 1). To reduce pill burden, she was switched to single-tablet efavirenz (EFV)/TDF/FTC at M66. Following several treatment interruptions, she switched to elvitegravir/cobicistat/TDF/FTC (EVG/c/TDF/FTC) at M83 and was then lost to follow-up at M96. She restarted antiretroviral therapy (ART) with EVG/c/TAF/FTC at M141 but switched to BIC/TAF/FTC due to fatigue and dizziness at M148; viral load was 128 890 copies/mL and genotype showed wild-type virus. Her other medications were TMP-SMX and a multivitamin, dosed separately from her ART. Following virological success (HIV RNA <40 copies/mL) on BIC/TAF/FTC, she experienced breakthrough viraemia (HIV RNA 18 870 copies/mL) at M161 due to poor adherence. Genotyping showed an emergent M184I mutation. She subsequently switched to BIC/TAF/FTC plus DRV/c but has yet to achieve virological success.

He simplified the regimen to DRV/RTV alone at M9 before resuming DRV/RTV/TDF/FTC at M20 due to persistent low-level viraemia of 54–60 copies/mL between M16 and M18; viral load was <40 copies/mL at M22.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was added for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis. Repeat genotyping at M61 showed wild-type virus. She continued to be prescribed BIC/TAF/FTC with ongoing viraemia due to poor adherence. At M79, her CD4 count was 166 cells/μL (11%), viral load was 4288 copies/mL, and genotypic resistance testing captured new reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations: T69D/N, K70E, and T215I, but she could not be contacted to switch her regimen. She discontinued BIC/TAF/FTC on her own at M82 upon learning she was pregnant. She restarted treatment with DTG + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/FTC at M84, before being intensified to darunavir (DRV) + ritonavir (RTV) + DTG + TDF/FTC when diagnosed with cerebral toxoplasmosis at M85. After delivery, she started DTG + rilpivirine (RPV)/TAF/FTC to reduce pill burden but did not achieve virological suppression and died of hypoxemic respiratory failure at M86. She experienced an HIV RNA <40 copies/mL on initial therapy with lopinavir/RTV + zidovudine/lamivudine (AZT/3TC). She then switched to atazanavir (ATV) + RTV + TDF/FTC for simplification at M25 but reported intermittent adherence and experienced episodes of breakthrough viraemia before stopping HIV therapy at M58. Genotyping at M65 revealed the V82I protease mutation along with several genetic polymorphisms in the protease gene (Table 1). To reduce pill burden, she was switched to single-tablet efavirenz (EFV)/TDF/FTC at M66. Following several treatment interruptions, she switched to elvitegravir/cobicistat/TDF/FTC (EVG/c/TDF/FTC) at M83 and was then lost to follow-up at M96. She restarted antiretroviral therapy (ART) with EVG/c/TAF/FTC at M141 but switched to BIC/TAF/FTC due to fatigue and dizziness at M148; viral load was 128 890 copies/mL and genotype showed wild-type virus. Her other medications were TMP-SMX and a multivitamin, dosed separately from her ART. Following virological success (HIV RNA <40 copies/mL) on BIC/TAF/FTC, she experienced breakthrough viraemia (HIV RNA 18 870 copies/mL) at M161 due to poor adherence. Genotyping showed an emergent M184I mutation. She subsequently switched to BIC/TAF/FTC plus DRV/c but has yet to achieve virological success. He initiated DRV/RTV/TDF/FTC at M5, when viral load was 2 437 253 copies/mL. He simplified the regimen to DRV/RTV alone at M9 before resuming DRV/RTV/TDF/FTC at M20 due to persistent low-level viraemia of 54–60 copies/mL between M16 and M18; viral load was <40 copies/mL at M22.

Here, we reported a case of persistent CNS viral escape with\nrecurrent symptomatic encephalitis, which had ultimate stabilization\nachieved by a combination of ART adjustment and corticosteroids.\n\n### Case presentation\n\nA 27-year-old man with HIV infection complained of recurrent headaches\nduring the last year. His magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) presented\ndiffused bilateral white matter lesions, and laboratory tests confirmed\nelevated CSF protein level, lymphocytic pleocytosis, and detectable CSF\nHIV RNA (774 copies/mL). Plasma HIV RNA was well suppressed with\ntenofovir, lamivudine, and lopinavir/ritonavir. Prednisone 60 mg once\ndaily was initiated to reduce intracranial inflammation, followed by a\ngood clinical response, with CSF HIV RNA still detectable (31.1\ncopies/mL). During the gradual tapering of prednisone, his headache\nrelapsed, and booming viral loads were detected in both CSF (4580\ncopies/mL) and plasma (340 copies/mL) with consistent drug-resistant\nmutations. Thereupon, prednisone was resumed and the ART regimen was\nswitched to zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir according to drug\nresistance tests. Persistent clinical recovery of symptoms,\nneuroimaging, and laboratory abnormalities were observed in the\nfollow-up visits.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCSF and plasma HIV RNA and further drug resistance tests should be\nmonitored in HIV-infected patients with neurologic symptoms, as\nopportunistic infections or tumors can be ruled out. ART optimization\nusing a sensitive regimen may be crucial for addressing CSF viral escape\nand the related encephalitis.\n\n\n\n## Case presentation\n\nA 27-year-old HIV-positive Chinese Manchu male complained of\nintermittent headache, nausea, and vomiting (non-projectile vomiting\nthree times in total) for two weeks in January 2022. No fever,\namaurosis, or unconsciousness were presented. He denied preceding travel\nor unusual animal exposures. He was diagnosed with HIV infection five\nyears ago and nadir CD4 ^+^ T-cell count was 79 cells/μL. He initiated\nART with tenofovir, lamivudine, and efavirenz, but treatment failure\noccurred one year later with plasma HIV RNA 2.19 × 10 ^5^ copies/mL and\nCD4 ^+^ T-cell count 14 cells/μL. The local doctor shifted the ART\nregimen to tenofovir, lamivudine, lopinavir/ritonavir without a\ngenotypic drug resistance test, and his plasma HIV viral load was well\ncontrolled thereafter. Neurological physical examination showed no\nabnormalities. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) presented\nbilateral multiple white matter T2-weighted hyperintensities especially\nin the FLAIR sequence (Fig. 1 A, a), without T1-wighted enhancement or\nmass effect. Lumbar puncture showed high intracranial pressure,\nlymphocytic pleocytosis, and elevated CSF protein level (Table ​\n(Table1). 1 ). CSF HIV RNA was 774 copies/mL, while plasma HIV RNA was\nundetectable. The following blood tests all displayed negative results,\nincluding the T-cell enzyme-linked immuno-spot assay for tuberculosis,\nthe syphilis rapid plasma reagin titer, *Toxoplasma gondii* IgG and IgM,\ncytomegalovirus (CMV) IgM, herpes simplex virus (HSV)1/2 IgM,\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV)-IgM, galactomannan, 1,3-β-D-glucan,\ncryptococcus antigen, EBV-DNA, CMV-DNA. Besides, the CSF tests which\ndetected acid-fast stain, India ink stain, cryptococcus antigen,\nculturing of bacteria and fungus, and CMV-DNA were also all negative. No\nother pathogens were confirmed by the next-generation sequencing in the\nCSF (using the MGISEQ-2000 platform in BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical\nTechnology, BGI-Shenzhen). The pathological phenotype of encephalitis\nwas required, but the patient declined brain biopsy. CD8 encephalitis\nwas suspected, and thus prednisone and glycerol fructose were prescribed\nempirically to reduce inflammation reactions in the brain.\n\nFig.1\n\nCerebral MRI, laboratory examinations and treatment during each visit.\nT2-weighted ( **A** ) and T2-FLAIR images ( **a** ) on January 8th, 2022\nshowed diffused high signals of white matter under the bilateral\nfrontoparietal temporal cortex, around the anterior and posterior\ncorners of the lateral ventricles. T2-weighted ( **B** ) and T2-FLAIR\nimages ( **b** ) on February 17th, 2022 presented obviously reduced area\nof multifocal leukoencephalopathy. T2-weighted ( **C** ) and T2-FLAIR\nimages ( **c** ) on June 27th, 2022 showed significantly enlarged\ndiffused white matter high signals on T2 and FLAIR sequence. T2-weighted\n( **D** ) and T2-FLAIR images ( **d** ) on August 20th, 2022 showed\nslightly reduced affected brain area. T2-weighted ( **E** ) and T2-FLAIR\nimages ( **e** ) on December 28th, 2022 presented remarkable\nimprovement, leaving only slight white matter damage\n\nOne month later, the patient presented headache relief, and obvious\nimprovement in MRI performance (Fig. 1 B, b) and laboratory tests in the\nCSF (Table ​ (Table1). 1 ). Then, prednisone was tapered (60 mg daily\nfollowed by a reduction of 5 mg per week) and discontinued in May 2022.\nHowever, he complained of a headache relapse in June 2022. MRI showed\nthe increased area of multifocal leukoencephalopathy (Fig. 1 C, c).\nMoreover, increased HIV replication was observed in both CNS and plasma,\nand further HIV drug resistance tests of CSF and plasma (Sanger\nsequencing in Dongguan Medical Laboratory of Micro-scale and Presicion)\npresented identical results of major protease inhibitor (PI)-related\nmutations, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-related\nmutations, and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-related\nmutations (Table ​ (Table1). 1 ). The encephalitis owning to CSF\ndrug-resistant HIV escape was considered. Thus, ART regimen was switched\nto zidovudine (sensitive), lamivudine (highly resistant), and\ndolutegravir (sensitive). As well, prednisone 60 mg daily was restarted.\nOne month after that, HIV suppression was achieved in both CSF and\nplasma (Table ​ (Table1), 1 ), and MRI displayed moderate shrink of\ndiffused white matter area (Fig. 1 D, d). Then, prednisone was tapered\n(the same as last time). A complete remission of brain MRI lesions was\nachieved in December 2022 (Fig. 1 E, e). Meanwhile, prednisone had been\nwithdrawn. The timeline for treatment adjustment and follow-up of this\ncase was clearly outlined in Fig. 2 .\n\n\n## Discussion and conclusions\n\nOne characteristic of this case was the occurrence of subacute\nencephalitis caused by CSF drug-resistant HIV escape, which highlights\nthe importance of CSF HIV RNA monitoring and the necessity of achieving\nsufficient CSF viral suppression under ART. The origin of CSF escape\nviral populations is either persistently replicating CNS reservoirs\n(likely in macrophages/microglia) or transient clonally expanded\ntrafficking of infected T cells in the CNS \\[ 3 \\]. Patients with CSF\nHIV escape may be symptomatic or asymptomatic \\[ 3 , 5 \\]. Active\nmanagement was recommended for cases with symptomatic CSF HIV escape \\[\n6 \\]. The neurosymptomatic CSF HIV escape with drug resistance mutations\nrequires ART adjustment according to genotypic drug resistance results\nfrom both CSF and plasma, because the discordance of resistance patterns\nin different biologic compartments has been reported \\[ 7 , 8 \\].\n\nThe brain MRI of this case was characterized by bilateral and\nsymmetrical FLAIR hyperintense abnormality throughout the cerebral white\nmatter, which resembled previously reported CD8 encephalitis cases \\[ 9\n, 10 \\]. Since the CD8 encephalitis case was first reported in 2004 \\[\n11 \\] and given a name in 2013 \\[ 12 \\], increasingly similar cases have\nbeen described. Although gadolinium contrast enhancing with the\nperivascular linear pattern was the typical imaging feature of CD8\nencephalitis, some cases did not present MRI enhancement \\[ 13 , 14 \\].\nMost CD8 encephalitis cases had a good response to corticosteroids, with\nwhich the survival rate was significantly higher than that of the\npatients with non-corticosteroid application \\[ 15 \\]. For the cases\nthat had no/transient response to corticosteroids, mycophenolate mofetil\n(MMF) might serve as a long-term steroid-sparing regimen \\[ 16 \\]. It\nwas a pity that the absence of brain biopsy and pathological proof for\nCD8 encephalitis was due to the refusal of the patient. A predominance\nof CD8 ^+^ T-cell infiltration, while only weak HIV protein expression\nwithout giant multinuclear cells, is the characteristic\nhistopathological finding among CD8 encephalitis cases \\[ 12 \\]. The CSF\ncharacteristic presentation of this case was a marked lymphocytic\npleocytosis, which may be associated with CSF HIV RNA replication,\ninflammation, and blood--brain barrier disruption. Although 90% (18/20)\nof CD8 encephalitis cases with subtyped CSF lymphocyte count\ndemonstrated predominantly CD8 ^+^ T cells with inverted CD4/CD8 ratio,\nthe CD4/CD8 ratio in CSF as a biomarker for CD8 encephalitis requires\nfurther investigation \\[ 17 \\]. The transient response to\ncorticosteroids in our case also suggested the underlying inflammatory\ninjury mechanism. Importantly, a sustained response to ART optimization\nhighlighted the role of targeting the underlying HIV replication, which\nis identical to a previous report \\[ 18 \\]. Apart from classical HIV\nencephalitis or HIV leukoencephalopathy in ART-naive patients \\[ 19 \\],\nwe should pay attention to the encephalitis with symptomatic CNS HIV\nescape in ART-treated patients as a special clinical phenotype of HIV\nencephalitis.\n\nIn conclusion, HIV-positive patients with neurological complaints should\nbe monitored for CSF HIV viral load and further genotypic resistance, if\nopportunistic infections or tumors can be excluded. Optimizing ART by\nusing sensitive drugs may achieve a CSF viral suppression and a\nfavorable outcome.\n\n## Funding\n\nThe authors received no specific funding for this work.\n\n## Availability of data and materials\n\nAll data from this study are included in this article.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 29026792\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: Patients were referred who were on ART treatment above 12 months and immunologically suspicious of treatment failure. The mean age of the participants was calculated to be 32.21 yr and over half of the patients (n=16) were male and the mean time of HARRT use was 47.69 months.  Standard first-line regimen in Iran is comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI);  drug resistance mutations for the 3 classes of ART (NNRTI, NRTI, and PI) were observed and 4 samples showed resistance to all of them.\nRationale: The paper mentions the patients got standard treatment, and the evidence indicates the presence of mutations associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, suggesting that individuals in the study had received these drug classes prior to sample sequencing.\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI\n\nPMID: 29026792\nQuestion ID: 16\nQuestion: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: Patients were referred who were on ART treatment above 12 months and immunologically suspicious of treatment failure.

The highest frequency of high-level drug resistance was demonstrated to be for lamivudine (72.4%) and emtricitabine (69%), while intermediate-level resistance showed to be the highest for abacavir (48.3%), stavudine (27.6%) and didanosine (27.6%).\nRationale: The evidence lists specific drugs (lamivudine, emtricitabine, abacavir, stavudine, didanosine) that were associated with drug resistance mutations, but the paper does not mention detailed drugs of patient treatment.\nAnswer: Not reported\n\nPMID: 25492033\nQuestion ID: 15\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: These two samples were genotyped from proviral DNA due to the lack of plasma in the case of TV016, the difficulty in amplifying from RNA in the case of TV1057, and the fact that these two patients were on treatment at the time of sampling. The dates of sampling collection predate the implementation of the public national HIV treatment campaign and thus only two of the patients were receiving antiretroviral therapy at the time of sampling.\nRationale: The paper mentions that two patients were receiving antiretroviral therapy at the time of sampling, but doesn't report the drugs and treatment history.\nAnswer: Not reported\n\nPMID: 38558010\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \" Objectives:\nThe in vivo selection of E157Q plus R263K has not been reported in patients treated with coformulated bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF).

Efficacy and safety were evaluated as\nvirological failure (VF=2 consecutive HIV-RNA\\>50 copies/mL or a single\nHIV-RNA\\>400 copies/mL) and treatment failure (TF=VF or discontinuation\nfor any reason) until data freezing (August 2022).\n\n### Results\n\nOf the 1040 PLWH included, 67.8% switched from\nelvitegravir/cobicistat/FTAF. VF occurred in 4.2% (n=44), with incidence\nrate of 1.63 per 1000 person-months of follow-up (PMFU) and probability\nat 24--30 months of 3.8%--4.0%, respectively. Out of the 44 VF, in 75%\nvirological re-suppression was achieved while maintaining BFTAF.\nDiscontinuation occurred in 15% after a median time of 13.5 months of\nfollow-up, with an incidence rate of 5.67 per 1000 PMFU, and a\nprobability at 24--30 months of 11.9%--15.3%, respectively. Main\ndiscontinuation reasons were simplification (51.3%) and toxicity (21.8%,\ninvolving CNS in half of cases). TF occurred in 18.6% with an incidence\nrate of 7.01 per 1000 PMFU after a median time of 13.6 observation\nmonths; probability at 24--30 months was 14.8%--18.4%, respectively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBFTAF has proven effective and well tolerated in clinical practice.\n\n\n\n## Methods\n\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted in adult PLWH on\nantiretroviral therapy and HIV-RNA \\<50 copies/mL, who switched to BFTAF\nto replace the current regimen, from June 2019 to June 2021. To be\nincluded in the analysis, they had to have at least an HIV-RNA\ndetermination (PCR Cobas ^®^ HIV-1 test 6800 Systems, Roche Diagnostics)\nafter the introduction of BFTAF. A validated in-house method was used to\nidentify resistance-associated mutations (RAMs), as previously described\nby our group. 11 GRT on plasma HIV-RNA and PBMC HIV-DNA was interpreted\naccording to the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database\nversion 9.0 (hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-sequences/, last updated on 22\nJune 2023).\n\nVirological failure (VF) was defined as two consecutive HIV-RNA values\n\\>50 copies/mL or a single HIV-RNA value \\>400 copies/mL. Treatment\nfailure (TF) is defined as the occurrence of virological failure or\ndiscontinuation of BFTAF for any reason.\n\nFollow-up accrued from the start of BFTAF (baseline) up to the stop of\nany drug in the regimen or lost to follow-up or data freezing (31 August\n2022).\n\nData are reported as medians (first-third quartile). The incidence rate\nof VF or TF was calculated as number of VF or TF events per 1000\nperson-months of follow-up (PMFU). The cumulative probabilities (95%\nconfidence interval, CI) of VF or TF were estimated using Kaplan--Meier\ncurves; the Log rank test was used to compare survival curves.\nUnivariate mixed linear models (MLM) with random slope and intercept for\neach patient were fitted to estimate mean changes in laboratory\nparameters (CD4+ lymphocytes, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, haemoglobin, neutrophil\ngranulocytes, creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate,\nglucose, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, FIB-4) since baseline. Slopes were\nreported with the corresponding 95% confidence interval. All analyses\nwere conducted using SAS statistical software version 9.4 (Statistical\nAnalyses System Inc, Cary, NC, USA).\n\nIndividuals provided written informed consent on the use of their data\nin scientific analyses and to be included in the Centro San Luigi (CSL)\nHIV Cohort. The CSL-HIV Cohort was approved by the Ethics Committee of\nthe IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute (Milan, Italy; date of\napproval 4 December 2017, protocol n. 34).\n\nThe authors declare that the procedures were followed according to the\nregulations established by the Clinical Research and Ethics Committee\nand to the Helsinki Declaration.\n\n\n\n## Results\n\nOverall, 1040 patients who met the above-mentioned inclusion criteria\nwere considered in the analysis (flowchart of data extraction in Figure\n1 ).\n\nFigure 1\n\nFlowchart of data extraction.\n\nMales represented 82.1% of the study population. At the beginning of\nBFTAF treatment, the median age (Q1-Q3) was 51.1 (42--57.1) years;\npatients had a known HIV infection lasting 13.8 (6.8--23.4) years and\nwere on ART for 10.2 (5.1--19.7) years; nadir CD4+ lymphocyte count was\n291 (166--447) cells/µL, while their current CD4+ count was 718\n(535--941) cells/µL; an AIDS diagnosis was present in 181 subjects\n(17.4%) and a history of HCV co-infection in 212 (20.4%).\n\nOf these 1040, 705 (67.8%) were taking ECFTAF, while 335 (32.2%) were on\na different regimen. Of those on a regimen other than ECFTAF, 194\n(59.9%) were on a three-drug integrase inhibitor-based regimen other\nthan elvitegravir, 56 (16.7%) on a protease inhibitor-based regimen, 38\n(11.7%) on a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based\nregimen, and 47 (14%) were taking a regimen that cannot be classified\namong the previous ones, including mono-and dual-therapies and\nstudy-protocol regimens. Among 335 patients not treated with ECFTAF, the\nswitch to BFTAF was motivated by simplification (lower drug burden,\nlower pill burden, no food requirement, fewer potential adverse effects,\nand/or potential drug--drug interactions) in 236 cases (70.4%), toxicity\nin 26 (7.8%), and by a miscellany of different reasons in 73 cases\n(21.8%), such as presence of drug--drug interactions, concern of\nco-morbidities, exit from clinical studies, patient's request.\n\nFurther details on the characteristics of the individuals included in\nthe analysis are shown in Table 1 .\n\nThe overall median follow-up was of 29.7 (24.4--32.3) months, for a\ntotal of 27,536 PMFU. The median follow-up was of 30.5 (26.7--32.7)\nmonths with 19,352 PMFU among people who switched from an ECFTAF regimen\nand of 27.8 (19.1--30.8) months with 8,183 PMFU among people from\nanother regimens.\n\nOverall, VF occurred in 44 (4.2%) patients, with an incidence rate of\n1.63 (95% CI 1.16--2.11) per 1000 PMFU; this event occurred after a\nmedian of 12.8 (5.8--22.8) months of observation. Median HIV-RNA values\nat failure were 246 (68--12,025) copies/mL, with 23 cases satisfying the\nfinding of two consecutive HIV-RNA values \\>50 copies/mL, and 21\ncorresponding to the criterion of a single HIV-RNA value \\>400\ncopies/mL.\n\nThe probability of VF at 12, 24 and 30 months was 2.1% (95% CI\n1.4--3.3%), 3.8% (95% CI 2.7--5.2%), and 4.0% (95% CI 2.9--5.5%),\nrespectively. The estimate up to 30 months of the probability of VF is\nillustrated in Figure 2 .\n\nFigure 2\n\nProbability of virological failure, Kaplan--Meier curve.\n\nNo statistically significant differences were observed in the\nprobability of VF between patients whose prior regimen was ECFTAF and\nthose who were on a regimen other than ECFTAF at the time of initiating\nBFTAF.\n\nMainly due to the low values of viremia at VF, genotypic resistance\ntests (GRTs) were able to evaluate the drug resistance at VF only in\nfive patients: none selected variants resistant to integrase inhibitors\nand no new mutations emerged in any case ( Table 2 ).\n\nOut of the 44 documented VF, in 33 cases (75%) BFTAF was successfully\nmaintained with spontaneous virological re-suppression in at least two\nsubsequent HIV-RNA determinations (data not shown). In a case-by-case\nrevision, those HIV-RNA blips were attributable to self-reported\ntransient non adherence (13/33 cases), intercurrent illnesses such as\nhigh or low respiratory tract infections, diarrhoea and vomiting,\nurinary tract infection and others (5/33 cases), drug--drug interactions\n(2/33 cases), recent vaccine administration (1/33 cases), and no evident\nexplanation in the remaining 12 cases. Five patients who developed VF\nwere switched to another regimen: darunavir/cobicistat/FTAF (DcFTAF) in\ntwo cases, dolutegravir (DTG) plus FTAF, DTG plus DcFTAF and rilpivirine\n(RPV)/FTAF in the other three cases, with virological suppression (3/5)\nor recurrent blips/low-level viremia (2/5). GRTs were fully amplifiable\nonly in one case and resulted in susceptibility to all NRTIs, InSTIs,\nand PIs; in another case, switched to DcFTAF, GRTs were performed but\nanalysis was feasible only for PIs, with full susceptibility. Finally, 6\nPLWH with evidence of VF were lost at follow-up. Finally, 6 PLWH with\nevidence of VF were lost at follow-up.\n\nBFTAF discontinuation occurred in 156 (15%) of patients after a median\nof 13.5 (6.8--23.4) months of follow-up; the incidence rate of regimen\ndiscontinuation was 5.67 (95% CI 4.78--6.55) per 1000 PMFU. The\nprobability of discontinuation at 12, 24 and 30 months was 6.4% (95% CI\n5.1--8.1%), 11.9% (95% CI 10--14%), and 15.3% (95% CI 13.2%-17.8),\nrespectively. The estimate of the probability of discontinuation up to\n30 months is illustrated in Figure 3 .\n\nFigure 3\n\nProbability of discontinuing BFTAF, Kaplan--Meier curve.\n\nNo statistically significant differences were observed in the likelihood\nof discontinuing BFTAF between patients whose prior regimen was ECFTAF\nand those who were on a regimen other than ECFTAF at the time of\ninitiating BFTAF.\n\nThe discontinuation of BFTAF occurred due to simplification to a regimen\nwith a lower drug burden in 70 (44.9%) patients, due to simplification\nfor other reasons in 10 patients (6.4%), due to central nervous system\ntoxicity in 14 (9%) and due to other types of toxicity in 20 (12.8%),\ndue to enrolment in clinical trials in 8 (5.1%), due to switch during\npregnancy in 3 cases (1.9%), due to suspected weight gain in 2 (1.3%)\nand to drug--drug interactions in 2 cases (1.3%); then, as already\nmentioned, the reason for discontinuation was VF in 5 cases (3.2%),\ndeath in 8 cases (5.1%) and a miscellanea of other reasons including\npatient's wish in 14 cases (9%).\n\nTF occurred in 193 (18.6%) patients, with an incidence rate of 7.01 (95%\nCI 6.02--8) per 1000 PMFU, after a median of 13.6 (7.1--23.4) months of\nobservation.\n\nThe probability of TF at 12, 24 and 30 months was 8.2% (95% CI\n6.7--10.1%), 14.8% (95% CI 12.7--17.2%), and 18.4% (95% CI 16.0--21.0%),\nrespectively. The estimate of the probability of outage up to 30 months\nis illustrated in Figure 4 .\n\nFigure 4\n\nProbability of treatment failure, Kaplan--Meier curve.\n\nThere were not statistically significant differences in the probability\nof TF between patients whose prior regimen was ECFTAF and those who were\non a regimen other than ECFTAF at the time of initiating BFTAF. During\nthe follow-up, statistically significant changes were found in CD4+\nlymphocytes, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, haemoglobin, neutrophil granulocytes,\ncreatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate, glucose, total\ncholesterol, HDL, LDL, FIB-4. No significant changes were observed in\nCD8+ lymphocytes, nor in the total cholesterol/HDL ratio. Laboratory\nparameters with a significant monthly increase or decrease over the\nstudy period are shown in Table 3 . During the observation period 11\n(1.1%) patients developed diabetes.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nAfter approximately 30 months of follow-up in a daily clinical practice\nsetting, the probability of virological failure or discontinuation of\nBFTAF for any reason, although higher than those observed in the pivotal\nclinical trials, 3--8 was small and consistent with those observed in\nobservational studies in our country. 12 , 13\n\nOverall, the results of our analysis confirm that BFTAF is an effective\nand well-tolerated regimen.\n\nEven in the cases of VF reported here, most patients (75%) developed a\nspontaneous virological control and, when genotypic resistance testing\nwas feasible, there was no evidence of emerging resistance to integrase\ninhibitors, emtricitabine (or lamivudine), or tenofovir.\n\nIt should be emphasized that over half of interruptions occur due to\nsimplification or enrolment in clinical trials, reasons that cannot be\nclassified as clinical failure of the regimen.\n\nIn many cases, the suspension of BFTAF was justified by the will to\nreduce the drug burden, in the absence of signs or symptoms of toxicity.\nIn this regard, it is necessary to highlight that, unlike the\nregistration studies, the population described has a long history of HIV\ninfection (about 14 years) and antiretroviral therapy exposure behind\nit, which may explain some treatment switches which should probably\nappear unjustified in patients on first or second-line therapy.\n\nA similar study was recently conducted in Spain; 14 performing an\nintention-to-treat analysis, Ambrosioni et al found that 78% of 1371\npatients who switched to BFTAF from another regimen had HIV-RNA \\<50\ncopies/mL after 12 months of follow-up. Treatment discontinuation\noccurred in 3% of cases, and the main cause of discontinuation (69% of\ncases) was toxicity. Less than 1% of patients experienced virological\nfailure during the 12-month follow-up.\n\nAnother real-world setting study was realized in Belgium between January\n2019 and September 2020. 15 It included 1593 treatment-experienced PLWH,\n93.2% of whom maintained virological suppression after 48 weeks; 17\nparticipants (1.1%) experienced viral blips and only a minority (0.7% of\noverall population including 363 naive-treatment subjects) met the\ncriteria for loss of virological suppression (two consecutive HIV-RNA\n\\>200 copies/mL) by week 48. 6.1% (97/1593) discontinued the BFTAF\nregimen, mainly because of adverse events and then because of switching\nto dual therapies.\n\nDespite the differences in design, in definition of success parameters\nand in length of observation period (16 months and 48 weeks,\nrespectively, versus 30 months of our analysis), the three studies run\nin clinical practice reached similar conclusions with regard to the\nefficacy and tolerability of BFTAF.\n\nThe reported analysis revealed some statistically significant variations\nin immunological and metabolic parameters, although none of these\nvariations can be considered clinically relevant: a slight increase in\nthe mean change per month from BL of lymphocytes CD4+ percentage, CD4+\nand CD8+ ratio, haemoglobin, total neutrophils, creatinine, glucose, and\nFib-4 Index, as well as a slight decrease in EGFR, triglycerides, and\ntotal cholesterol, LDL, and HDL ( Table 3 ). Pivotal studies in\nantiretroviral-naive patients have shown a modest worsening of the lipid\nprofile during treatment with BFTAF \\[3--8\\]; on the contrary, analyses\nrevealed a trend towards improvement. The difference is probably due to\nthe fact that BFTAF was prescribed in PLWH who were largely already\nreceiving TAF, cobicistat, and sometimes boosted protease inhibitors,\ndifferently from what happened in the pivotal studies. 6--8\n\nThe trend towards a monthly increase in glycemia is quantitatively\nnegligible in terms of clinical relevance. In our cohort, during the\nperiod of follow-up, 1% of patients developed diabetes, an incidence\nthat seems to agree with data recently reported in similar groups of\nPLWH. 16 Nevertheless, in an ageing population that is considered at\nhigher risk of metabolic disorders regardless of ART type, it deserves\nto be kept under observation over time. 17\n\nThe slight increase in creatinine (with a relatively slight decrease in\neGFR) is likely related to the known effect of bictegravir on tubular\ncreatine transport, which does not reflect an actual reduction in\nglomerular filtration rate. 3--9\n\nOnly in rare cases, these changes led to precautional discontinuation of\nBFTAF, not justified by a current clinical condition but because of a\nconcern of not already known long-term adverse events.\n\nThis study presents some limitations, such as retrospectivity, the\nabsence of a standardized evaluation of adherence to treatment, and an\namount of missing data for some variables. Nevertheless, the real-world\nsetting and the long duration of follow-up, which largely took place\nduring the problematic period of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\npandemic, represent its main strength.\n\n\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn this context of clinical practice, the treatment of HIV infection\nwith a single daily tablet of BFTAF has proven to be effective and well\ntolerated, with a low rate of virological failure. The rate of\ndiscontinuation and of TF was largely influenced by treatment\nsimplification with 2-drug regimens, rather than toxicity.\n\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nFunding for this publication was partially provided by an unconditional\ngrant by Gilead Sciences (Medical Grant n. 15424).\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 37194419\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Methods: We performed a retrospective review of treatment-experienced patients who started DTG + 3TC in a cohort of PWH.

Median age and time with HIV infection were 51.7 and 13.4 years, respectively. The median number of previous antiretroviral combinations was three. Previous virological failure was reported in 27.1% of patients, and the M184V resistance mutation was detected in 17 patients. At 144 weeks, the percentage of individuals with HIV-RNA &lt;50 copies/mL was 77.4% (277/358) in the ITT analysis and 95.5% (277/290) in the PP analysis. A total of 68 participants were excluded from the PP analysis (data missing, 25, discontinuation due to toxicity, 19; other, 16; death, 8).

This study\nseeks to identify and analyze HIV-1 recombinants in Russia during the\nlast decade of the epidemic. A comprehensive examination was conducted,\nencompassing 3178 partial pol sequences. Subtyping was achieved through\nvarious programs including COMET, the Stanford Database, REGA, jpHMM,\nRIP, and RDP4 for recombination analysis. The study also involved\nphylogenetic analysis to trace the origins of the identified\nrecombinants. Primary resistance (PrimDR) prevalence and Drug Resistance\nMutations (DRMs) were assessed. The study uncovered an overall\nproportion of recombinants at 8.7%, with a statistically significant\nincrease in their frequency observed over time ( *p* \\< 0.001). The\nNorthwestern (18.5%) and Siberian (15.0%) Federal Districts exhibited a\nhigh prevalence of recombinants, while the Volga (1.9%) and Ural (2.8%)\nFederal Districts had a lower prevalence. Among HIV-1 recombinants, a\nPrimDR prevalence of 11.4% was identified. Notably, significant\ndifferences in DRMs were observed, with a higher prevalence of M184V in\nsub-subtype A6 ( *p* = 0.018) and K103N in CRF63_02A6 ( *p* = 0.002).\nThese findings underscore the increasing HIV-1 genetic diversity and\nhighlight a substantial prevalence of PrimDR among its recombinant\nforms, emphasizing the necessity for ongoing systematic monitoring.\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1. Study Population and Data Collection\n\nThe material of the study were blood plasma collections ( *n* = 2502),\nperipheral blood mononuclear cells (lymphocytes) collections ( *n* =\n613), and frozen whole blood collections ( *n* = 63) obtained from\nHIV-infected patients at federal and regional centers for HIV/AIDS\nprevention (AIDS Centers) as part of molecular genetic monitoring of the\nHIV epidemic in Russia in the period from 2011 to 2020. We analyzed\nsequences and their associated demographic and epidemiological data. The\nsequences covered the HIV-1 protease (PR) and part of the reverse\ntranscriptase (RT).\n\nInformed consent was signed by all HIV-infected patients included in the\nstudy in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All the data were\nanonymized and coded.\n\n### 2.2. RNA and DNA Extraction, Amplification, and HIV-1 Sequencing\n\nBlood collection and fractionation procedures to obtain lymphocytes and\nblood plasma were carried out by employees of federal and regional AIDS\nCenters.\n\nThe ViroSeqTM HIV-1 Genotyping System kit (Celera Diagnostics, Alameda,\nCA, USA) was used for RNA extraction from blood plasma samples.\nCommercial kit (the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (\"QIAGEN\", Hilden,\nGermany)) was used for DNA extraction from lymphocytes and frozen whole\nblood.\n\nAmplification of HIV-1 *pol* gene fragments was performed automatically\nby nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method according to the\nprotocols presented in Table 1 .\n\nPCR conditions are presented in Supplemental Table S1 .\n\nIn case of working with HIV-1 RNA, the first step involved performing a\nreverse transcription reaction as described in the ViroSeq HIV-1\nGenotyping System user manual \\[ 23 \\].\n\nTo purify amplified DNA fragments from the reaction mixture, a\ncommercial kit using magnetic particle suspension (\"Sileks\", Moscow,\nRussia) and a commercial Cleanup S-Cap kit (\"Evrogen\", Moscow, Russia)\nwere used.\n\nSanger-based sequencing of the HIV *pol* gene regions encoding the PR-RT\n(2253--3554 bp according to the HXB-2 strain, GenBank accession number\nK03455 ) was performed. Sequencing reaction for amplification protocols\nA and B ( Table 1 ) was performed using BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle\nSequencing Kit (\"Applied Biosystems\", Waltham, MT, USA) according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol. The set of primers depended on amplification\nprotocol ( Table 1 ):\n\n-\nfor A protocol: PRsec1 (CAAAAATTGGGCCTGAAAATCCATA), PPOS2\n(GCTAATTTTTTAGGGAAGATCTGGCCTT), RTsec1 (CAAAAATTGGGCCTGAAAATCCATA),\nRTOA (TGCCTCTGTTAATTGTTTTACATCATTAGTGTG);\n\n-\nfor B protocol: F2111 (CAAAGGGAGGCCAGGAAATTT), polR1\n(TCTCTTCTGTTAATGGCCATTGTTTAA), RT1A (GTTGACTCAGCTTGGTTGTAC), R3271\n(ACTGTCCATTTGTCAGGATG).\n\nSequencing conditions: 1 cycle at 96 °C for 2 min, 25 cycles at 96 °C\nfor 10 s, 50 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 4 min, with final extension at 72\n°C for 7 min. The obtained nucleotide sequences were processed using the\nSequencing Analysis Software v. 5.2 (Applied Biosystems, USA).\n\nThe sequencing reaction in the ViroSeq system was performed according to\nthe manufacturer's protocol. Then, sequence processing was performed\nautomatically using ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping Software v. 3.0 (Applied\nBiosystems, USA).\n\nMultiple sequence alignments were performed using the ClustalW module\nintegrated into the AliView v.1.27 software package \\[ 24 \\]. When\nproblematic regions in the obtained alignments were identified,\nadditional sequence alignments were performed \"manually\". The total\nlength of the alignment was at least 919 nucleotides, which covered the\nentire protease and partial reverse transcriptase (positions 2253--3171\nand more (up to 3554), HXB2-numbering GenBank K03455 ).\n\n### 2.3. Preliminary HIV-1 Subtyping\n\nPreliminary HIV-1 subtyping was performed using the online tools: COMET\nHIV-1 \\[ 25 \\], HIVdbProgram Sequence Analysis, presented on the website\nof Stanford University \\[ 26 \\], and REGA HIV-1 Subtyping Tool (V3) \\[\n27 \\], according to the algorithm shown in Figure 1 .\n\nFigure 1\n\nAlgorithm for determining HIV-1 genetic variants.\n\nWhen the HIV-1 genetic variant was unambiguously interpreted with\nidentity from 97 to 100% in all three programs, it was considered to be\nreliably determined. In case of ambiguous results and/or less than 97%\nidentity, the sequences were subjected to additional analysis. First, we\nsearched for closely related sequences using the BLAST tool (\nhttps://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/BASIC_BLAST/basic_blast.html\naccessed on 1 March 2023). If several closely related sequences were\nfound with identity from 97 to 100%, the genetic variant of sequences\nunder investigation was defined as identical to those found. The\nremaining sequences were subjected to additional recombination analysis.\n\n### 2.4. Recombination Analysis\n\nSequences with an indeterminate genetic variant were subjected to\nadditional recombination analysis using jpHMM \\[ 28 \\], RIP (\nhttps://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/RIP/RIP.html accessed on 1\nMarch 2023), and Recombination Detection Program \\[ 29 \\] tools.\nReference nucleotide sequences used for RDP4 program analysis are\npresented in Supplemental Table S2 . A recombination event detected by\nRDP4 was considered valid if it was identified by two or more\nmathematical models.\n\nGraphical representations of genome maps highlighting recombination\npoints were generated either using the jpHMM v.0.1.4 software or\nmanually created based on RDP4 results using the Recombinant HIV-1\nDrawing Tool (\nhttps://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/DRAW_CRF/recom_mapper.html\naccessed on 1 March 2023).\n\n### 2.5. Phylogenic Analysis\n\nThe analysis was performed for the recombinant forms identified in the\nstudy. The best-fit model of nucleotide substitutions was selected using\njModelTest v. 2.1.7 according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC)\n\\[ 30 \\]. Epidemiological clusters were determined using the\nmaximum-likelihood analysis implemented by the IQ-TREE \\[ 31 \\] with\n1000 bootstrap replicates and Shimodaira--Hasegawa (SH-aLRT) test.\nClusters with an SH-aLRT support \\> 0.9 were considered reliable.\nVisualization and graphical processing of the phylogenetic analysis\nresults were carried out using iTOL v.6 software \\[ 32 \\].\n\nReference sequences were sourced from the database of the Los Alamos\nLaboratory, USA (\nhttps://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/mainpage.html accessed on\n1 March 2023).\n\n### 2.6. Drug Resistance Mutation Analysis\n\nIn this study, we performed drug resistance analysis among HIV-infected\npatients not on ART, infected with both viruses of \"pure\" subtypes and\nits recombinant forms. The analysis utilized Stanford University's HIVdb\ndatabase tool and the Calibrated Population Resistance Tool (CPR) \\[ 33\n\\].\n\nSince we could not estimate the duration of patients' infection and the\npossibility of their treatment in the past, and only knew that they were\nnot receiving ART at the time of genotype analysis, we decided not to\ncall this pretreatment drug resistance or transmitted drug resistance,\nand introduced the general name of primary resistance (PrimDR) in this\ncontext.\n\n### 2.7. Statistical Analysis\n\nThe analysis was carried out using the R programming language (RStudio\nv.1.3.1093, Inc. Software, Boston, USA), as well as the STATISTICA v.\n6.0 (StatSoft, Tulsa, USA).\n\nTo estimate the trends in HIV-1 recombinant form prevalence in the\nRussian Federation, the following conditions were established:\n\n1.\nHIV-1 nucleotide sequences were sourced from a minimum of 4 (50%)\nfederal districts annually;\n\n2.\nIn the event that Condition No. 1 was not met, the option to\naggregate data from multiple years or incorporate supplementary\nsequences from the international database of the Los Alamos\nLaboratory (\nhttps://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/mainpage.html accessed\non 1 March 2023) was permitted, ensuring characteristics aligned\nwith the examined sequences (pol gene; coordinates: 2253--3554,\nHXB2-numbering; with a minimum sequence length of 919 bp).\n\nCategorical data evaluated in the study were presented as proportions\nand frequencies and their comparison was carried out using the\nchi-square test (χ2); if unstable, Yates' correction χ2 or Fisher's\ntwo-sided exact test was used. Estimates of the PrimDR and DRMs\nprevalence were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nDifferences were considered significant at *p* -value \\< 0.05. Data\nvisualization was performed using the R programming language.\n\n\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. Characteristics of the Study Population\n\nThe genotyping results of 3178 HIV-infected patients from seven Russian\nfederal districts (FDs) were examined. The majority of patients hailed\nfrom the Central FD (1247, 39.2%), followed by the Southern (555,\n17.5%), Siberian (460, 14.5%), Volga (251, 7.9%), Far Eastern (243,\n7.7%), and Ural (216, 6.8%) FDs. The smallest patient cohort hailed from\nthe Northwestern FD---totaling 206 (6.5%). A male predominance (1775,\n55.9%) was noted in the gender distribution of HIV-infected patients (\nTable 2 ).\n\nThe study population had a median age of 35.0 years, ranging from 24.6\nto 45.4 years. The population exhibited an aging trend, primarily\ncomprising individuals of working age, with a range of 23.0 to 48.6\nyears. The main risk factor was heterosexual contacts (1642, 51.7%),\nfollowed by intravenous drug usage (1196, 37.6%), MSM contacts (148,\n4.7%), and mother-to-child transmission (113, 3.6%).\n\nOut of the total patient count, 65 individuals (2.0%) did not have a\nclearly identified risk factor. Among the cases of HIV-infection, 14\n(0.4%) were categorized under the \"Other\" group. This \"Other\" group\nincluded the following: nosocomial infections, 12 cases; infections\nacquired during professional medical activities, one case; and a single\ncase resulting from the tattooing process.\n\n### 3.2. Primary HIV-1 Subtyping\n\nThe vast majority of the studied PR-RT sequences ( *n* = 3178) were\nclassified as sub-subtype A6 (2633, 82.9%), followed by subtype B (227,\n7.1%). The combined prevalence of the circulating recombinant forms\n(CRFs) CRF02_AG and CRF63_02A6 was 4.8% (151 sequences); CRF03_AB (36,\n1.1%) was also found. Other genetic variants accounted for less than 1%\neach and were presented by the following subtypes: A1 (1/3178), C\n(22/3178), D (1/3178), F1 (1/3178), G (18/3178), and recombinant forms\nCRF01_AE (1/3178) and CRF11_cpx (1/3178). A difficult-to-interpret\ngenotyping results were obtained for 86 sequences (2.7%), which were\npreliminarily classified as unique recombinant forms (URFs).\n\nSubsequently, we conducted an analysis of the prevalence of HIV-1\ngenetic variants among patients categorized into distinct transmission\nrisk groups ( Table 3 ).\n\nAmong patients who were infected through heterosexual transmission, a\nsignificant prevalence of sub-subtype A6 viruses (1385/1642, 84.3%) was\nobserved. Subtype B dominated (73/148, 49.3%) in the MSM cohort ( *p* \\<\n0.001). A high frequency of HIV-1 recombinant forms (CRFs and URFs\ntogether) was noted among IDUs (10.2%).\n\n### 3.3. Phylogenetic Analysis of HIV-1 Recombinant Forms\n\nFirst, we analyzed viruses of recombinant forms first identified\ndirectly on the territory of the Russian Federation and widely spread\nthere---CRF03_AB and CRF63_02A6 \\[ 14 , 15 \\].\n\nSequences attributed to CRF02 and CRF63 forms were included in a unified\nphylogenetic analysis, owing to the interrelation between these\nrecombinant forms and the relatively comparable structure of their\ngenomes ( Figure 2 ).\n\nFigure 2\n\nResults of phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 CRF02_AG and CRF63_02A6\ncirculating in Russia. Alignment length---1098 bp; nucleotide\nsubstitution model---TIM + I + G4. The sequences investigated are marked\nin black, the reference sequences are marked in red. The yellow cluster\ncontains CRF02 sequences of African origin. The orange cluster includes\nCRF02 sequences identified in the former Soviet Union (Uzbekistan). The\npink colored cluster encompasses sequences attributed to CRF63_02A6.\nBlack ovals outline transmission clusters among IDUs, the largest of\nwhich include IDUs from the Moscow region and Krasnodar territory.\nPurple ovals outline transmission clusters among MSM. Red ovals outline\nclusters of transmission of infections acquired during professional\nmedical activity. A red asterisk indicates a sequence classified as a\nURF by the analysis.\n\nThe results revealed the following pattern of clustering: 36 sequences\nwere grouped within CRF02 clusters, originating from diverse sources (3\nfrom Africa and 33 from FSU); and 110 sequences were categorized within\nthe CRF63 cluster. In addition, one sequence was clustered separately\nfrom the others on the phylogenetic tree and identified as URF.\n\nFurthermore, numerous significant clusters were directly identified\namong the examined sequences, signifying multiple instances of virus\ntransmission within the country.\n\nSequences attributed to CRF03_AB formed the significant cluster with the\nreference sequence first identified in Kaliningrad during the 1980s.\nThis finding further suggests the occurrence of multiple instances of\nvirus transmission within the country ( Figure 3 ).\n\nFigure 3\n\nResults of phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 CRF03_AB circulating in\nRussia. Alignment length---1098 bp; nucleotide substitution\nmodel---TVM + I + G4. The sequences investigated are marked in black,\nthe reference sequences are marked in red.\n\nTwo of the identified HIV-1 recombinant forms---CRF01_AE and\nCRF11_cpx---are rare and uncharacteristic in its genetic structure on\nthe territory of the Russian Federation. We found that CRF01_AE entry\ninto the territory of Russia occurred as a result of its single\nintroduction from the Republic of the Philippines; CRF11_cpx came from\nAfrica ( Figure 4 ).\n\nFigure 4\n\nResults of phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 recombinant forms CRF01_AE and\nCRF11_cpx identified in Russia. For CRF01_AE: alignment length---1305\nbp; nucleotide substitution model---TVM + I + G4; for CRF11_cpx: 1305\nbp, GTR + I + G4. The investigated nucleotide sequences are highlighted\nin purple color.\n\n### 3.4. URFs Found in Russia\n\nThe vast majority of URFs were formed by A6/B (70/87, 80.5%), followed\nby A/G (13/87, 14.9%). A mosaic genome structure was found in 4.6%\n(4/87) of URFs ( Supplemental Table S3 ).\n\nThe analysis of the B-segments of AB-unique recombinant genomes revealed\nthe following distribution: 31.4% (22/70) of them contained the\nB-segment common among FSU countries (B-FSU), 27.1% (19/70) were\nassociated with the B-pandemic clade, 18.6% (13/70) contained\nB-Caribbean fragments, and 17.1% (12/70) contained B-Thailand fragments\n\\[ 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 \\]. Furthermore, four AB-unique recombinant\nforms (AB-URFs) were identified, characterized by genomes composed of\nsegments from sub-subtype A6 and CRF03_AB.\n\n### 3.5. Prevalence of HIV-1 Recombinant Forms\n\nSub-subtype A6 was the most common genetic variant circulating among\nresidents from seven Federal Districts. The regions displaying the\nhighest genetic diversity were the Central, Northwestern, Far Eastern,\nand Southern FDs. ( Figure 5 ).\n\nFigure 5\n\nDistribution of HIV-1 genetic variants (by *pol* gene) in the FDs of the\nRussian Federation in the period 2011--2020 (N ~total~ = 3178).\n\nA notable difference in the HIV-1 recombinant form prevalence was\nobserved across the Federal Districts (FDs), with high rates in the\nNorthwestern (18.5%) and Siberian (15.0%) FDs, and low rates in the\nVolga (1.9%) and Ural (2.8%) FDs. Within the Northwestern FD, a\nsubstantial prevalence of CRF03_AB (12.1%) was noted, while in the\nSiberian FD, CRF63_02A6 was prominent (13.3%).\n\nFurthermore, a significant upward trend in the frequency of HIV-1\nrecombinant forms was identified over time. In samples collected during\n2011--2012 (N = 835), recombinant forms were present in 4.8% of cases.\nThis prevalence escalated to 7.6% in samples from 2015--2016 (N = 741),\nand surged to 25.4% in samples from 2019--2020 (N = 1203) ( *p* \\<\n0.001) ( Figure 6 ).\n\nFigure 6\n\nThe frequency of HIV-1 recombinant forms and \"pure\" subtypes in Russia\nin the period 2011--2020.\n\nA visual assessment revealed a sharp increase in the proportion of\nrecombinants in the period 2017--2018, which is most likely due to the\ninclusion of sequences from the city of Cherepovets, which is\ncharacterized by a high prevalence of CRF03_AB HIV-1. Despite this shift\nin sampling, the general trend towards an increase in the frequency of\nthe detection of recombinant forms of HIV-1 in the Russian Federation\nhas remained over time.\n\n### 3.6. PrimDR and DRMs between HIV-1 \"Pure\" Subtypes and Recombinant Forms\n\nWe investigated the prevalence of PrimDR and individual DRMs in PR-RT\nsequences derived from HIV-infected patients not on ART (N = 1494)\nconcerning PIs, NRTIs, and NNRTIs. The prevalence of PrimDR in patients\ninfected with HIV-1 recombinant forms (N = 175) was 11.4% (95% CI,\n7.5--17.0%), and in patients infected with HIV-1 \"pure\" viral subtypes\n(N = 1319) it was 6.9% (95% CI, 5.7--8.4%) ( *p* = 0.044). The overall\nprevalence of PrimDR in patients not on ART with the 2011--2020 sampling\nyears was 7.4% (95% CI, 6.2--8.9%). The most frequent DRMs were\nK103N---33,3% (37/111), M184V---32.4% (36/111), G190S---17.1% (19/111),\nand M46I---10.8% (12/111).\n\nThe frequencies of certain DRMs were significantly different between\nHIV-1 recombinant forms and \"pure\" subtypes; the major NNRTI-associated\nmutation K103N was more frequently observed in CRF63_02A6 (65.0% (95%\nCI, 43.3--81.9%) vs. 26.4% (95% CI, 18.4--36.3%), *p* = 0.002), and the\nNRTI mutation M184V was more frequently observed in sub-subtype A6\n(37.4% (95% CI, 28.1--47.6%) vs. 10.0% (95% CI, 2.8--30.1%), *p* =\n0.018) ( Figure 7 ).\n\nFigure 7\n\nFrequency of DRMs among HIV-1 recombinant forms and \"pure\" subtypes. Two\nasterisks indicate mutations for which statistically significant\ndifferences were found.\n\nThe greatest diversity of DRMs was observed in viruses with a unique\ngenome structure that carried mutations to ARV of different classes:\nG73S to PIs; M41L, D67N, K70R, and M184V to NRTIs; and K103N, Y181C, and\nG190S to NNRTIs. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was found in 10% (95% CI,\n2.8--30.1%) of patients not on ART infected with HIV-1 recombinant\nforms.\n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nIn this study, we analyzed 3178 HIV-1 *pol* sequences obtained from\nHIV-infected patients from seven Russian federal districts. Our aim was\nto identify and analyze recombinant forms of HIV-1 in Russia in the last\ndecade of the epidemic using phylogenetic and recombination approaches.\nThe present study showed a wide genetic diversity of HIV-1 with an\nincreasing frequency of recombinant forms in Russia. Phylogenetic\nanalysis revealed both single cases of the introduction of recombinant\nforms into Russia and their multiple transmission within the country.\nDifferent DRMs have been observed between \"pure\" subtypes and\nrecombinant forms of HIV-1. Our study contributes to understanding the\nmain trends of the HIV epidemic in Russia, assessing its biological and\nsocial driving forces, as well as to understanding the dynamics of\nchanges in the HIV-1 genetic structure and evaluating the effectiveness\nof currently used ART. All nucleotide sequences obtained in the study\nwere deposited in the international database of the Los Alamos\nlaboratory ( Supplemental Table S4 ).\n\nThis study highlights significant trends in the progression of the HIV\nepidemic in Russia. Notably, there has been an evident shift towards an\n\"aging\" HIV-infected population, along with a notable rise in female\ninvolvement compared to the preceding decade. This has resulted in an\nincrease in heterosexual transmission \\[ 39 \\]. There is also an\nincrease in the proportion of MSM, but this is most likely due to\nimproved epidemiological investigations and greater \"openness\" of this\ncohort to physicians. The median age within the study population was\n35.0 years, indicating this ageing trend. Notably, individuals within\nthe active working age bracket (23.0 to 48.6 years) comprised the\nmajority. The male-to-female ratio was 1.3:1. In terms of risk factors,\nthe majority of patients sampled between 2011 and 2020 reported\nheterosexual contact as the primary mode of transmission (51.7%),\nfollowed by intravenous drug use (IDUs) at 37.6%, and men who have sex\nwith men (MSM) at 4.7%.\n\nOur findings revealed that sub-subtype A6, historically widespread in\nFSU countries, remains the dominant HIV-1 genetic variant in seven FDs\n(82.6%), followed by subtype B (7.1%). This also reflects the general\npatterns of the HIV epidemic in Russia, described in previous studies \\[\n11 \\]. Obviously, the co-circulation of HIV-1 belonging to different\ngenetic variants, along with high population mobility within a single\nterritory, may contribute to their further recombination and the\nformation of new genetic variants, as evidenced by studies of HIV-1\nrecombinant forms detected in Russia---CRF03_AB and CRF63_02A6---and in\nneighboring countries---CRF02_AG \\[ 14 , 15 , 40 \\]. According to the\nresults of our study, the proportion of each of the recombinant forms\nwas 1.1% for CRF02_AG and CRF03_AB, and 3.6% for CRF63_02A6. In addition\nto HIV-1 CRFs, 87 URFs were found, which accounted for 2.7% of all\nnucleotide sequences examined. Other genetic variants were found with a\nfrequency of less than 2%.\n\nThese findings indicate the extensive genetic diversity of HIV-1 in\nRussia, emphasizing the necessity for ongoing and systematic monitoring.\nThe highest genetic diversity was observed in the Central, Northwestern,\nFar Eastern, and Southern FDs.\n\nIt should be noted that a high frequency of HIV-1 recombinant forms\n(CRFs and URFs together) was noted among IDUs (10.2%). This is possibly\nexplained by the highest probability of double- and superinfections when\nusing non-sterile instruments (needles/syringes). A number of studies\nhave noted the importance of dual HIV infection for the formation of\nHIV-1 recombinant forms and the development of drug resistance, even\namong naїve patients \\[ 41 , 42 \\].\n\nAn assessment of the prevalence of HIV-1 recombinant forms in the last\ndecade of the epidemic in Russia revealed a significant increase in\ntheir frequency over time ( *p* \\< 0.001). A high prevalence of HIV-1\nrecombinant forms was observed in the Northwestern (18.5%) and the\nSiberian (15.0%) Federal Districts, which are the territorial centers of\nCRF03_AB and CRF63_02A6 origination in Russia, respectively \\[ 14 , 15\n\\].\n\nA low prevalence of HIV-1 recombinant forms was observed in the Volga\n(1.9%) and Ural (2.8%) FDs. This may be associated with the internal\nmigration processes in Russia. For example, in the Volga Federal\nDistrict (FD), a significant emigration to other regions was observed,\ncoupled with a minimal influx of the population \\[ 43 \\].\n\nThe phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 recombinant forms in Russia revealed\nthat CRF01_AE and CRF11_cpx originated from the Republic of the\nPhilippines and Africa, respectively. In the case of CRF03_AB and\nCRF63_02A6 recombinant viruses, multiple transmissions within Russia\nwere observed, likely due to their widespread presence in the region \\[\n14 , 15 \\]. The most robust phylogenetic clusters encompassed several\nnucleotide sequences obtained from IDUs.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of URFs were composed of A6 and B (80.5%),\nwhich are the prevailing genetic variants in Russia \\[ 11 \\]. A further\n14.9% of URFs were formed by A6 and G, while the remaining 4.6%\nexhibited a mosaic genome structure. This diversity of URFs indicates an\nactive recombination process within the country, potentially leading to\nthe rapid emergence and widespread dissemination of new CRFs.\n\nAn analysis of the B-segments of the AB-URFs genome showed that 31.4% of\nthem contained the B-FSU segment, which was first identified and is\nstill widespread in Ukraine (Mykolaiv) among IDUs \\[ 44 \\], and 27.1% of\nthem contained the B-segment related to the pandemic clade, which\noriginated in the USA and later entered Western Europe countries through\nlocal epidemics among MSM or through IDUs \\[ 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 \\].\nThe distribution of this subtype B is most likely due to the relative\ngeographic proximity of Russia to European countries and the\nintensification of contacts between them in the late 1990s. The\nremaining 18.6% of the AB-URFs genome contained B-Caribbean and 17.1%\ncontained B-Thailand fragments distributed in the Caribbean and\nThailand, respectively. Tourism might have played a role in their\nintroduction to Russia; however, factors such as geographical remoteness\n(particularly for the Caribbean region) and the comparatively recent\nsurge in popularity of tourist destinations like Thailand could have led\nto a slower dissemination, unlike the faster spread seen with B-FSU and\npandemic B strains.\n\nOur study revealed statistically significant differences in the\nprevalence of PrimDR between viruses of \"pure\" subtypes and recombinant\nforms ( *p* = 0.044). A higher prevalence of PrimDR was observed for\nrecombinants forms (11.4%), which is 1.4% higher than the 10% threshold\nvalue \\[ 45 \\]. A previous study by other researchers demonstrated the\npredominance of HIV-1 recombinant forms (96.2%) in a cohort of\nHIV-infected people in Wuhan (China) where transmitted DR among\nART-naїve patients was 23.9% \\[ 46 \\]. Also, the prevalence of drug\nresistance mutations (DRMs) among HIV-1 unique recombinant forms in\npeople under long-term antiretroviral treatment failure from the Yunnan\nProvince (China) was 56.9% \\[ 47 \\].\n\nThe overall prevalence of PrimDR to any drug classes in the 2011--2020\nsampling years was 7.4%, mainly due to NNRTI. Thus, a higher prevalence\n( *p* = 0.002) of K103N in HIV-1 recombinant forms, in particular, in\nCRF63_02A6, was observed. The K103N mutation is located in the region of\nthe CRF63_02A6 genome, which includes a fragment belonging to another\nrecombinant form, CRF02_AG. The presence of K103N is primary conditioned\nby the use of EFV as part of the preferred first-line therapy regimen in\nRussia \\[ 48 \\]. In previous studies, the predominance of K103N among\nnaїve patients infected with CRF63_02A6 and CRF02_AG was noted \\[ 49 ,\n50 \\].\n\nIt is also worth noting that the K103N mutation is not associated with a\nmajor impact on viral fitness, and the persistence of a drug-resistant\nvirus without reduced replication capacities is likely after ART\ninterruption \\[ 51 , 52 , 53 \\]. This suggests that this mutation is\nbeneficial for HIV-1 and is most frequently selected during\nrecombination.\n\nA heightened prevalence of the M184V mutation was noted within\nsub-subtype A6 ( *p* = 0,018). This can be explained by the wide\ndistribution of this HIV-1 genetic variant and the use of 3TC and FTC as\nthe main components of the preferred first-line therapy regimens in\nRussia. Earlier investigations also demonstrated the predominance of the\nM184V mutation in subtype A viruses. However, this observation was\nprimarily compared with subtype D viruses in those studies \\[ 54 \\].\n\nQuite a high proportion of DR was detected to NNRTIs, which may indicate\nthe need to abandon them in favor of promising drugs of the integrase\ninhibitor class. Thus, in December 2020, the Ministry of Health of the\nRussian Federation approved the clinical recommendations \"HIV infection\nin adults\", in which DTG was included in one of the three options of\npreferred first-line ART regimens for adults along with EFV and ESV.\nAlso, in 2021, the first long-term contract for this drug was conducted\n\\[ 55 , 56 \\].\n\nOf particular interest at present is also the long-acting injectable\ntreatment for HIV-1, which is being actively introduced in Europe.\nMultivariable baseline factor analysis across the latter three clinical\ntrials (FLAIR, ATLAS, and ATLAS-2M) recently showed that HIV-1 subtypes\nA6/A1, characterised by the L74I integrase (IN) polymorphism, were one\nof the factors associated with an increased risk of virological failure\n(VF) using dual therapy CAB + RPV (with odds ratio 6.59). These findings\nemphasize the potential importance of genotyping across the integrase\ndomain \\[ 57 , 58 \\].\n\nThe study acknowledges certain limitations, notably the potential for\nbiased assessments due to uneven sample distribution across Federal\nDistricts, with the Central FD contributing the largest portion (39.2%),\nand the Northwestern FD the smallest (6.5%). Additionally, our findings\nare confined to the HIV-1 pol region; employing complete genomes may\nyield more precise insights into the prevalence of recombinant virus\nforms. Therefore, caution is advised in interpreting the results.\n\nDespite these constraints, we posit that our analysis, encompassing 3178\nsequences from HIV-infected patients both receiving ART and not on ART,\nserves as a crucial component of the molecular genetic monitoring of the\nHIV infection from 2011 to 2020. This approach is deemed optimal for\ncomprehending shifts in the genetic structure of HIV-1, including its\nrecombinant forms, over time, especially in the absence of universal\ngenotyping and genotypic resistance testing for all HIV-infected\nindividuals prior to therapy.\n\nThe findings from our study suggest a rise in the proportion of\nrecombinant forms within the genetic structure of the HIV-infection\nepidemic, encompassing those with primary resistance. This trend\ncoincides with the spread of the HIV infection beyond vulnerable groups\nand into the general population. These developments could potentially\nincrease the prevalence of drug resistance prior to treatment, with the\npotential to exceed the 10% threshold recommended for genotypic\nresistance testing before initiating therapy in the upcoming years.\n\n\n## Data Availability Statement\n\nAll nucleotide sequences obtained in the study were deposited in the\ninternational database of the Los Alamos laboratory.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 36146776\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: Monitoring HIV-1 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs) is important for disease surveillance. Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing. It focuses on the analysis of HIV-1 sequences and the identification of recombinant forms and drug resistance mutations.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 36298841\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: In an effort to evaluate the accuracy of HIV-1 phylogenies based on genomes of increasing length, we developed a comprehensive near-full-length HIV-1 genome RT–PCR assay and performed a comparative evaluation via phylogenetic analyses. To this end, we conducted comparative analyses of HIV-1 phylogenies derived based on HIV-1 PR/RT (2253–3359 in the HXB2 genome) and pol region (2253–5250 in the HXB2 genome) sequences isolated from 134 HIV-1-infected patients in Cyprus (2017–2019). The HIV-1 genotypic subtypes determined using six subtyping tools (REGA 3.0, COMET 2.3, jpHMM, SCUEAL, Stanford, and Geno2pheno) were compared to investigate the discrepancies generated among different tools. To evaluate the accuracy of defined HIV-1 phylogenies, the samples exhibiting at least one discrepant subtyping result among different subtyping tools in both PR/RT and pol regions or only in the pol region (n = 38) were selected for near-full-length HIV-1 genome (790–8795 in HXB2 genome) sequencing using a newly developed RT–PCR/sequencing assay. The obtained sequences were employed for HIV-1 genotypic subtype determination and subjected to comparative phylogenetic-based analyses. It was observed that 39.6% of the 134 samples presented discrepancies in the PR/RT region, while 28.4% presented discrepancies in the pol region. REGA 3.0 produced the fewest discrepancies collectively in both regions and was selected for subsequent subtyping and comparative phylogenetic analyses of near-full-length HIV-1 genome sequences. The analyses of near-full-length HIV-1 genome sequences identified 68.4% of the 38 ‘discrepant samples’ (n = 26) as belonging to uncharacterized recombinant HIV-1 strains, while 21.1% were circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) (n = 8) and 10.5% belonged to pure group M subtypes (n = 4). The findings demonstrated a significant reduction of 11.2% in discrepancies when pol region sequences were used compared to PR/RT region sequences, indicating that increased nucleotide sequence lengths are directly correlated with more consistent subtype classification. The results also revealed that if the discrepancy in pol region subtyping results persists, then there is a high likelihood (89.5%) that the query sequence is a recombinant HIV-1 strain, 68.4% of which belong to uncharacterized recombinant HIV-1 strains. The results of this study showed that REGA 3.0 presented the best performance in subtyping recombinant HIV-1 strains, while Stanford performed better in defining phylogenies of pure group M subtypes. The study highlights that, especially in populations with polyphyletic HIV-1 epidemics resulting in a high prevalence of recombinant HIV-1 strains, neither PR/RT nor pol region sequences are reliable for the determination of HIV-1 genotypic subtypes in samples showing discrepancies among different subtyping tools, and only near-full-length or full-length HIV-1 genome sequences are sufficiently accurate.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the phylogenetic analysis and subtyping of HIV-1 sequences from patient samples.

We determined the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity in Bulgaria during 2012--2020 using polymerase sequences from 1053 of 2010 (52.4%) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. Sequences were analyzed for DRM using the WHO HIV SDRM list implemented in the calculated population resistance tool at Stanford University. Genetic diversity was inferred using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetics. Cluster detection and characterization was performed using MicrobeTrace. The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%). Most (34/60, 56.7%) of the SDRMs were present in transmission clusters of different subtypes composed mostly of male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC), including a 14-member cluster of subtype B sequences from 12 MMSC and two males reporting heterosexual contact; 13 had the L90M PI mutation and one had the T215S NRTI SDRM. We found a low SDRM prevalence amid high HIV-1 diversity among ART-naive patients in Bulgaria during 2012--2020. The majority of SDRMs were found in transmission clusters containing MMSC, indicative of onward spread of SDRM in drug-naive individuals. Our study provides valuable information on the transmission dynamics of HIV drug resistance in the context of high genetic diversity in Bulgaria, for the development of enhanced prevention strategies to end the epidemic.\n\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity using sequences from ART-naive individuals.

HIV-1M has diversified into multiple subtypes, sub-subtypes, and circulating and unique recombinant forms (CRFs/URFs). An unanswered question is why some rare subtypes never reached epidemic levels despite their age. Several studies identified the role of HIV-1M accessory genes nef and vpu in virus adaptation to human hosts and subsequent spread. Other reports also pointed out the pivotal role of gag in transmissibility, virulence, and replication capacity. In this study we characterized the HIV-1 gag gene of 148 samples collected in different localities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) between 1997 and 2013. We used nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the whole gag gene. PCR products were sequenced either by Sanger method or by next generation sequencing on Illumina MiSeq or iSeq100 platforms. Generated sequences were used for subsequent analyses using different bioinformatic tools. Phylogenetic analysis of the generated sequences revealed a high genetic diversity with up to 22 different subtypes, sub-subtypes, CRFs. Up to 15% (22/148) URFs were identified, in addition to rare subtypes such as H, J, and K. At least two amino acid motifs present in the gag gene have been shown to modulate HIV-1 replication, budding, and fitness: the P(T/S)AP and the LYPXnL motifs. Structural analysis revealed the presence of P(T/S)AP in all the 148 sequences with the majority (136/148) bearing the PTAP. Three samples presented a duplication of this motif. The LYPXnL motif was identified in 38 of 148 sequences. There was no clear link between the frequency of these motifs and HIV-1M subtypes. In summary, we confirmed a high genetic diversity of HIV-1M in the DRC. We observed the presence of amino acid motifs important for viral replication and budding even in some rare HIV-1 subtypes. Their impact on viral fitness needs be further evaluated by in vitro studies.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the genetic diversity and structural features of the HIV-1 gag gene from patient samples.

We investigated the genetic diversity and\nprevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) followed by phylogenetic\nanalysis in 270 HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve individuals from Croatia\nin the period 2019--2022. The results of this research confirmed a high\noverall prevalence of TDR of 16.7%. Resistance to nucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside RTIs (NNRTIs), and\nprotease inhibitors (PIs) was found in 9.6%, 7.4%, and 1.5% of persons,\nrespectively. No resistance to integrase strand-transfer inhibitors\n(INSTIs) was found. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 173/229\nsequences (75.5%) were part of transmission clusters, and the largest\nidentified was T215S, consisting of 45 sequences. Forward transmission\nwas confirmed in several clusters. We compared deep sequencing (DS) with\nSanger sequencing (SS) on 60 randomly selected samples and identified\nadditional surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) in 49 of them.\nOur data highlight the need for baseline resistance testing in\ntreatment-naïve persons. Although no major INSTIs were found, monitoring\nof SDRMs to INSTIs should be continued due to the extensive use of\nfirst- and second-generation INSTIs.\n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1. Study Population\n\nThis study was conducted at the Department for Immunological and\nMolecular Diagnostics at UHID. Data collection and analysis were\nperformed on HIV-1 RNA plasma samples collected from newly diagnosed HIV\npatients over a four-year period during the diagnostic process and\nclinical follow-up at UHID. All newly diagnosed treatment-naïve PLHIV\nover 18 years who entered clinical care at UHID in the period between\nJanuary 2019 and December 2022 with plasma viraemia \\> 1000 HIV-1 RNA\ncopies per ml were included in this study. A total of 270 persons met\nthe inclusion criteria. Further epidemiological and demographic data on\nthe patients were supplied by the Reference Centre for HIV/AIDS.\n\n### 2.2. RNA Extraction, Amplification, and Sequencing\n\nAt least 500 μL of the patient's plasma samples were concentrated at\n20,000 g and 8 °C for 1 h. A portion of the supernatant was removed, and\nthe remaining 140 μL was used for RNA extraction using a QIAamp Viral\nRNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's\nprotocol.\n\nAmplification of the HIV-1 *pol* gene was performed for two regions in\ntwo separate reactions: (1) sequencing of the HIV-1 protease and partial\nsequencing of the reverse transcriptase gene; and (2) sequencing of the\nHIV-1 integrase gene.\n\nThe first round of amplification was performed by using the SuperScript\nIII One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum *Taq* (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,\nCA, USA) and a region-specific primer set while nested PCR was carried\nout using AmpliTaq Gold™ DNA Polymerase with Gold Buffer and MgCl ~2~\n(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with an inner primer set.\nNested PCR amplicons were purified and sequenced with a BigDye\nTerminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,\nMA, USA) with a set of four primers for both sequencing regions to\nobtain bidirectional sequences ( Supplementary Table S1 ).\n\n### 2.3. Genotyping and Drug Resistance Mutations Analysis\n\nSequences were aligned and compared with the reference strain HIV-1 HXB2\n(GenBank number K03455 ) by using SnapGene software 7.0 (\nwww.snapgene.com (accessed on January--October 2023).\n\nPrimary resistance to antiretroviral drugs was defined as the presence\nof ≥1 mutation placed on the WHO surveillance for drug resistance\nmutations (SDRM) list. Clinically relevant resistance to NRTIs, NNRTIs,\nPIs, and INSTIs was evaluated with the Stanford University HIV Drug\nResistance Database, Genotypic Resistance Interpretation Algorithm\nversion 9.5 \\[ 35 \\] and the IAS Drug Resistance Mutation list \\[ 36 \\].\nA Stanford score of 15 to 29 predicts low-level resistance and a score\nof 60 or above predicts high-level resistance \\[ 35 \\].\n\nHIV-1 strains were defined as resistant if carrying at least one SDRM.\nThe overall prevalence was defined as the percentage of patients with\nSDRMs. The prevalence of TDR for the different drug classes (NRTI,\nNNRTI, PI, and INSTI), was defined in the same matter.\n\nHIV-1 subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) were determined\nusing the Rega HIV-1 Subtyping Tool version 3.0., COntext-based\nModelling for Expeditious Typing (COMET), and the jumping profile Hidden\nMarkov Model (jpHMM) \\[ 37 , 38 , 39 \\].\n\n### 2.4. Deep Sequencing Analysis\n\nA total of 60 samples that were previously sequenced by SS were randomly\nselected and subjected to NGS. Previously extracted RNA was reverse\ntranscribed with SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for\nRT-PCR (Invitrogen) and UNINEF primers \\[ 40 \\]. Precisely, the whole\nHIV-1 protease region, part of the reverse transcriptase region ( K03455\nnumber for the gene-specific position 2189--3753), and the integrase\nregion ( K03455 number for the gene-specific position 4180--5200) were\nsequenced on the Illumina platform using MiniSeq (Illumina, San Diego,\nCA, USA). Four separate multiplex PCR reactions using ALLin Taq DNA\nPolymerase (highQu, Kraichtal, Germany) were made for each sample with\n22 primer pairs that span the target region ( Supplementary Table S2 ).\nAmplicons for each sample were then pooled and purified with Agencourt\nAmpure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). Sequencing\nlibraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit\nfor Illumina (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA, USA), according to the\nmanufacturer's protocol. The library concentrations and purification\nwere measured with an Agilent High Sensitivity Kit (Agilent\nTechnologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) on Bioanalyzer 2100. Libraries were\nsequenced on MiniSeq using the MID output 300 cycles reagent kit\n(paired-end; 151 + 151). Raw reads were trimmed using the cutPrimer tool\nto remove the synthetic primer sequences used in the multiplex PCR\nreactions. Trimmed data in the form of FASTAQ files were analysed using\nthe HyDRA Web tool ( http://hydra.canada.ca/ (accessed on July--October\n2023) according to the HyDRA Web User Guide \\[ 41 \\]. Data were analysed\nwith the following settings: sensitivity threshold (5%), default target\ncoverage (10,000 reads), default filtering settings (length cut-off: 30;\nscore cut-off: 30; minimum variant quality: 30; minimum read depth: 50)\n\\[ 41 \\]. The frequencies of DRMs were interpreted using the HIVdb\nalgorithm version 9.5 \\[ 35 \\].\n\n### 2.5. Phylogenetic Analysis\n\nA total of 229/270 (84.8%) PR and RT sequences were subjected to\nphylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic trees were constructed for the most\nfrequent subtypes so the final dataset consisted of 191 subtype B\nsequences, 28 BD recombinant sequences, and 10 subtype A1 sequences. The\ndataset was supplemented with ten sequences of high similarity for each\nsample sequence by using the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool)\ndatabase \\[ 42 \\]. The ElimDupes tool available at the Los Alamos\ndatabase ( https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/ (accessed on July--October 2023)\nwas used to remove duplicate sequences \\[ 8 \\].\n\nMultiple sequence alignment for all datasets was performed in ClustalX\nv.2.1 and edited in AliView v.1.27 \\[ 43 , 44 \\].\n\nTo rule out clustering bias due to the presence of drug resistance\nmutations (DRM), phylogenetic trees were constructed with the exclusion\nof 43 codons that are DRM sites, resulting in a final sequence size of\n858 bp. The following major drug resistance mutations, according to the\nIAS list, were removed: PR: 23, 24, 30, 32, 46, 47, 48, 50, 53, 54, 73,\n76, 82, 83, 84, 85, 88, 90; RT: 41, 65, 67, 69, 70, 74, 75, 77, 100,\n101, 103, 106, 115, 116, 151, 179, 181, 184, 188, 190, 210, 215, 219,\n225, 230.\n\nMaximum likelihood trees for all dataset groups were constructed in\n*Mega* v.10.2.6 \\[ 45 \\] under 1000 bootstrap replicates with the\nbest-fitting nucleotide substitution model (GTR+I+G) for each dataset\nselected according to Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Two\nsequences of subtype A1 were used to root the subtype B (accession\nnumbers OR606275 and OR606276 ) and the B-D recombinant (accession\nnumbers OR606048 and OR613874 ) trees, and two sequences of subtype B\n(accession numbers OR606211 and OR606184 ) were used to root the subtype\nA1 tree.\n\nTransmission clusters (TCs) were identified in the maximum likelihood\ntrees using *ClusterPicker* v.1.2.3. \\[ 46 \\] with a genetic distance\nand bootstrap support threshold of 4.5% and 90%, respectively. Clusters\nwere defined as a group of three or more persons/sequences on the same\nbranch of the phylogenetic tree. Local TCs were defined as clusters\nconsisting of \\>75% of Croatian sequences, while mixed TCs were defined\nas clusters consisting of \\<75% of Croatian sequences. The final review\nand arrangement of the obtained phylogenetic trees was made in iTOL\nv.6.4.2 \\[ 47 \\].\n\n### 2.6. Statistical Analysis\n\nDescriptive statistics were used to summarize the main features of the\ndata. Values were described by percentages and frequencies or median\nwith first and third quartiles (Q1, Q3). The association between the\nselected variables was analysed by Pearson's chi-squared test or\nFisher's exact test for categorical data and by the Mann--Whitney test\nfor continuous data. Statistical significance was defined as *p* \\< 0.05\ntwo-sided. All data were analysed using the statistical R software\nversion 2.13.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).\n\n\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. Study Population\n\nA total of 280 newly diagnosed treatment-naïve persons entered the\nCroatian Reference Centre for HIV/AIDS (86 in 2019, 58 in 2020, 68 in\n2021, and 68 in 2022) from January 2019 to December 2022. Ten people did\nnot meet the inclusion criteria, so the final data set consisted of 270\npersons, providing coverage of 96.4%. The study group consisted\nprimarily of men (254/270, 94.1%) with only 16/270 (5.9%) women making\nit to the final analysis. The median age at HIV diagnosis was 38 years\nand the main acquisition risk was MSM (231/270, 85.6%) followed by\nheterosexual contact (32/270, 11.9%). At the time of genotypic\nresistance testing, the median CD4 T cell count was 284 cells/μL (IQR\n95--460) and the median plasma HIV-1 RNA level was 5.0log10 copies/mL\n(IQR 4.4--5.5). Characteristics of newly diagnosed PLHIV in the period\n2019--2022 are shown in Table 1 .\n\nMore than eight different HIV-1 genotypes and CRFs were identified\nwithin the cohort, with subtype B being the most common (73.3%,\n198/270), followed by subtype A1 (4.4%, 12/270); the other genotypes\nwere CRF 12_BF (1.5%, 4/270), CRF01_AE (1.5%, 4/270), subtype C (1.1%,\n3/270), subtype F1 (1.1%, 3/270), and CRF06_CPX (0.7%, 2/270). A\nsignificant number of sequences were defined as recombinants, and\naccording to the REGA Subtyping Tool, the most frequent were B-D (10.7%,\n29/270), followed by A1-C (1.5%, 4/270) and F1-B (1.1%, 3/270)\nrecombinants ( Supplementary Table S3 ).\n\n### 3.2. Prevalence of TDR and SDRMs\n\nHIV drug resistance analysis was performed on the viral sequences of 270\npersons covering the RT/PR and IN regions. The IN region for six people\nfailed to amplify.\n\nThe overall prevalence of SDRMs was estimated at 16.7% (45/270) (\nSupplementary Table S4 ).\n\nA total of 42/270 (15.6%) persons were identified with one drug class\nmutation, one person had mutations associated with resistance to two\ndrug classes, and two individuals harboured triple class resistant virus\n(SDRM NRTI + NNRTI + PI).\n\nResistance to NRTI was the most common (9.6%; 26/270), followed by NNRTI\n(7.4%; 20/270) and PI (1.9%; 5/270).\n\nAmong the NRTI mutations, T215S was the most frequent (8.1%, 22/270)\nfollowed by L210W (1.5%, 4/270). Mutations K103N (3.7%, 10/270) and\nK101E (3.3%, 9/270) were the most frequent NNRTI mutations followed by\nL100I (1.1%, 3/270). PI mutations V32I, I47V, and I85V were each\ndetected in two samples (0.7%). No major INSTI mutations were\nidentified; however, the integrase resistance associated accessory\nmutation L74I was found in 7 (2.6%) integrase sequences, of which 5 were\nclassified as non-B subtypes.\n\nAll identified SDRMs were clinically relevant according to the\nInternational AIDS Society (IAS) list 2022, except T215S, T215D, T215E,\nK219R, and T69D. Mutation I85V was not listed as a major or accessory\nDRM on the Stanford drug resistance mutation list. One individual\nharboured non-polymorphic accessory mutation A98G, and although it is\nnot included on the WHO SDRM list, it is clinically relevant. The\nestimated prevalence of TDR to the selected antiretrovirals according to\nthe Stanford scoring system is shown in Supplementary Figure S1 .\n\nMutations E138A and E138K, which are clinically relevant according to\nthe IAS list 2022 but are not included on the WHO SDRM list, were\ndetected in 12 (4.4%) and 9 (3.3%) samples, respectively. E138A was\nidentified in six subtype B sequences and six subtype A1 sequences (\nSupplementary Table S5 ).\n\nThe majority of persons carrying SDRMs associated with any drug class\nwere MSM infected with subtype B (66.7%, 30/45), while the others were\nMSM of subtype A1 (1/45), B-D recombinants (6/45), and CRF 39_BF (1/45).\nFive persons were infected with subtype B and one with CRF12_BF through\nheterosexual contact. One person carrying SDRM of unknown transmission\nrisk was infected with subtype B.\n\nAdditionally, we explored the association between SDRMs and the\ndemographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of persons\nincluded in this study. Statistical analysis revealed that there were no\nsignificant associations between the SDRMs in the study population and\nage, transmission risk group, plasma viraemia, CD4+ T-cell count,\ngender, or subtype ( Supplementary Table S6 ).\n\n### 3.3. Deep Sequencing Analysis\n\nA total of 60 persons were subjected to this part of the study where we\ncompared patterns of SDRMs detected by SS and DS. To compare the results\nof the two sequencing methods, we considered a 5% and 15% threshold for\nDS and SS, respectively.\n\nIn 8/60 (13.3%) samples, no SDRMs were detected by any method. SDRMs\nwere detected by DS in 52 samples (86.7%) and by SS in 20 samples\n(33.3%). A total of 31 and 72 SDRMs were identified by SS and DS,\nrespectively. In detail, 49 SDRMs, including 44 NRTI-associated, 1\nNNRTI-associated, 1 PI-associated, and 3 INSTI-associated SDRMs were\nidentified by DS but missed by SS. Of those 49 SDRMs, 39 were identified\nat frequency \\<15%, and 7 of them were identified at frequency \\>15%.\nAlthough a threshold of 5% was considered for DS analysis, in one sample\nwe reported a mutation with frequency \\<5% because it was identified by\nSS as well. These discrepancies in mutation frequencies are likely\ncaused by the inherent stochasticity of the PCR process as well as the\nimperfect removal of the synthetic primer sequences from the raw reads.\n\nFurthermore, eight SDRMs were detected only by SS and missed by DS,\nincluding two NRTI-associated, three NNRTI-associated, and three\nPI-associated SDRMs. The reason for these discrepancies is likely caused\nby filtering a portion of total NGS reads due to their poor mapping\nquality, which consequently resulted in insufficient coverage of the\ntarget region that contains SDRMs detected by SS.\n\nComplete mutation concordance when both SS and DS identified the same\npattern of SDRMs was observed in 8/52 (15.4%) samples. Partial\nconcordance was identified in 7/52 (13.5%) samples where DS identified\neither additional mutations or SS identified mutations that were missed\nby DS. Complete divergence was observed in 34 samples (65.4%) when\ndifferent patterns of SDRMs were detected by SS and DS or when only DS\ndetected additional mutations. These discordant results mostly refer to\nsamples where DS detected T215S as a single mutation or in combination\nwith other mutations at frequencies \\<15% (28 samples) or \\>15% (5\nsamples) ( Supplementary Table S7 ).\n\n### 3.4. Phylogenetic Analysis\n\nPhylogenetic analysis was performed on sequences of the most prevalent\nsubtypes. In accordance with that, maximum likelihood trees were\nconstructed separately for 191 sequences of subtype B, 28 B-D\nrecombinant sequences, and 10 sequences of subtype A1. Phylogenetic\nanalysis was not performed for the other subtypes, recombinants, or CRFs\ndue to an insufficient number of sequences. The dataset for subtype B\nand B-D recombinants was supplemented with sequences from the period\n2014--2017 and non-Croatian sequences as background sequences. That\ndataset enabled the identification of active as well as newly formed\nclusters. Namely, active clusters were defined as a group of sequences\nfrom the old (2014--2017) and new (2019--2022) periods, while the newly\nformed clusters consisted only of sequences from the new period\n(2019--2022).\n\nFor the analysis of cluster size, we defined clusters with 10 persons or\nmore as large and clusters with less than 10 persons as small. Based on\nthe defined settings for TCs, a total of 40 TCs with sequences in the\npresent study were determined by phylogenetic analysis, precisely 30/40\n(75.0%) of subtype B, 7/40 (17.5%) of B-D recombinants, and 3/40 (7.5%)\nof subtype A1. In addition, we identified 14 transmission pairs\nconsisting only of sequences from the study period or in combination\nwith a background sequence.\n\nWe described transmission clusters in relation to gender (male vs.\nfemale), age, stage of HIV diagnosis (acute vs. non-acute), plasma\nviraemia, CD4 count, transmission risk (MSM vs. non-MSM), HIV subtype (B\nvs. non-B), and SDRMs. For the majority of the selected demographic,\nepidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data, no statistically\nsignificant association between persons observed in TCs as compared to\npersons outside TCs was found, except for age ( *p* \\> 0.001). Namely,\nindividuals of a younger age were more likely to be identified in TCs (\nTable 2 ).\n\nThe subtype A1 phylogenetic tree revealed that local sequences were part\nof three mixed clusters. Namely, two mixed clusters containing one local\nsequence each, which indicates a separate introduction of these strains\ninto the country, and one cluster containing six local sequences was\nidentified for subtype A1 ( Supplementary Figure S2 ).\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of the B-D recombinants revealed that 15 Croatian\nsequences from the present study were part of three newly formed local\nclusters (two local and one mixed). Another seven sequences from the\npresent study were part of three local active clusters and one mixed\ncluster containing sequences from the period 2014--2017. Sequences with\nSDRMs T215S ( *n* = 2) and I85V ( *n* = 2) were part of two local\nclusters. In addition to that, two transmission pairs with Croatian and\nnon-Croatian sequences with a support threshold of \\>0.9 were identified\nas well ( Supplementary Figure S3 ).\n\nPhylogenetic data of subtype B accounted for the largest proportion of\nthe analysed cohort and included 191 sequences from the present study\n(new dataset) and 536 background sequences. A total of 173/536 (32.3%)\nbackground sequences were Croatian sequences from the period 2014--2017\n(old dataset).\n\nPhylogenetic analysis for subtype B revealed that 74.9% (143/191) of\nsequences were a part of 16 local TCs with Croatian sequences (old and\nnew datasets) and 14 mixed TCs with non-Croatian sequences with a\nsupport threshold of \\>0.9. In detail, we identified 8 TCs (26.7%) with\nup to 5 persons, 15 TCs (50.0%) with 5 to 15 persons, and 7 TCs (23.3%)\nwith ≥16 persons. Overall, we identified 14 small clusters and 16 large\nclusters with sizes ranging from 3--45 persons. All identified clusters\nwere active, with 18 TCs among them expanding throughout the study\nperiod, while 12 were newly formed. Among the newly formed TCs, three\nwere local and nine included non-Croatian sequences. In addition, the\nphylogenetic analysis identified 12 transmission pairs with bootstrap\nsupport \\>0.9 containing Croatian sequences from the study period (\nFigure 1 ). Ten TCs with ≥5 Croatian sequences and their characteristics\nare presented in Table 3 .\n\nFigure 1\n\nMaximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the Croatian HIV-1 subtype B\nsequences from the old (2014--2017) and new (2019--2022) datasets and\nbackground sequences. Branches of Croatian sequences from the new\ndataset are coloured according to the transmission risk: (MSM: men who\nhave sex with men---red; heterosexual---blue). Branches of sequences\nfrom the old dataset are coloured green, while branches of all\nbackground sequences are coloured black. All identified surveillance\ndrug resistance mutations (SDRMs) are positioned on the tree along with\nthe corresponding sequences. For SDRMs T215S, T215S  +  L210W, K101E,\nand K103N that formed local transmission clusters (TCs), above each\ncluster, the corresponding SDRMs are noted. TCs with \\>75% of Croatian\nsequences (local clusters) are highlighted in light pink, while TCs with\n\\<75% of Croatian sequences (mixed clusters) are highlighted in light\nblue.\n\nOne sequence (accession number OR606232 ) seems to be unassigned, even\nthough it has been classified as subtype B by the Rega HIV-1 Subtyping\nTool, version 3.0.\n\nOnly one subtype B sequence carrying SDRMs was not included in the\nphylogenetic analysis. A total of 33 subtype B sequences carrying SDRM\nwere part of the TCs. Forward transmission throughout the period\n2019--2022 was determined in several clusters: (1) T215S ( *n* = 19),\nwith its sub-cluster T215S + L210W ( *n* = 4), (2) K101E ( *n* = 9), and\n(3) K103N ( *n* = 5). One TC was newly formed, consisting only of\nsequences from present study and two of them were expanding clusters\nconsisting of sequences from the new and old datasets.\n\nA comparison of the clinical, demographic, and molecular characteristics\nof these TCs consisting only of sequences from the new dataset\n(2019--2022) is given in Table 4 .\n\nT215S remained the most common SDRM, determined in clusters as in the\nprevious study. Namely, 45 sequences from the old and new datasets\nformed one large cluster with SDRM T215S, with a sub-cluster T215S +\nL210W expanding throughout the period of the new dataset. One sequence\nfrom the present study with SDRMs M41L + T215Y was identified in one\nlocal cluster consisting of sequences from the old and new datasets but\nthey did not share that SDRM pattern.\n\nOne sequence with SDRM pattern L100I + K103N did not form a cluster with\nany of the sequences, indicating an independent route of infection with\nno evidence of transmission.\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nIn order to characterize the HIV epidemic in Croatia by analysing HIV-1\ndiversity, TDR, and transmission clusters, we combined virological,\nclinical, molecular, and epidemiological data from 270 newly diagnosed,\ntreatment-naïve persons with HIV who enrolled in clinical care at the\nReference Centre for HIV-AIDS at UHID in the period 2019--2022. More\nthan 90% of treatment-naïve PLHIV that entered clinical care in the\nstudy period were included in this nationally representative study where\nwe continued the longitudinal monitoring of TDR in Croatia.\n\nThe majority of the study population was men (94.1%) and the most\nprevalent age group was 18--35 years. Most of the patients originated\nfrom and reported Croatia as the country of infection and were included\nin the MSM risk group (94.8% and 85.6%, respectively). The\ncharacteristics of the study group are in agreement with the reports of\nour last nationwide study \\[ 31 \\]. Our study cohort consisted of \\>50%\nof late presenters with a median CD4 count of 284 cells/μL and it is\nworth mentioning that a high prevalence of very late presenters (38.5%)\nwas identified among them. According to the European Late Presenter\nConsensus Working Group, late presentation for HIV care refers to\nindividuals presenting for care with a CD4 count below 350 cells/µL, or\nwith an AIDS-defining event regardless of the CD4 cell count, while very\nlate presenters (VLP) are characterized by presenting a CD4 count lower\nthan 200 cells/μL or an AIDS-defining event, regardless of the CD4 cell\ncount \\[ 48 \\]. The data of two large European cohort studies in the\nperiod 2010--2016 and the ECDC data show that even in high-income\ncountries such as in the European region, late presentation accounts for\n36.9 to 64.2% of all HIV diagnoses \\[ 49 , 50 \\].\n\nIn this study, we reported the prevalence of SDRMs in Croatia in the\nperiod 2019--2022. The prevalence of SDRMs was estimated at 16.7% over\nthe study period. The HIV-1 epidemic in Croatia is characterized by a\nhigh prevalence of TDR, which was reported in our last two nationwide\nstudies \\[ 22 , 31 \\]. Although, a decreasing trend for TDR was observed\nover time (22% in the period 2006--2008 vs. 16.4% in the period\n2014--2017), these numbers are still higher than the average of other\nEuropean countries and even countries from the same region \\[ 23 \\]. The\nEuropean Society for Translational Antiviral Research (ESAR) is\nresponsible for monitoring the prevalence of TDR in Europe through the\nSPREAD program, and according to its last study, which included a\ndataset from 2008--2010, the overall prevalence of TDR was estimated to\nbe 8.3% \\[ 23 \\]. The data on TDR have not been updated since 2016, but\nin a more recent study it was shown that during 2011--2019, the TDR\nprevalence in Europe increased to 12.8% \\[ 51 \\]. TDR differs in\ndifferent regions of the world and can change with the availability and\nintroduction of new treatment regimens. Namely, the prevalence of TDR\nfor the period 2014--2019 was 14.2% in North America, followed by 9.1%\nin Latin America and the Caribbean, 8.5% in Europe, 6.0% in sub-Saharan\nAfrica, and 4.1% in southeast Asia \\[ 23 , 52 \\]. In the Balkan region,\nthe numbers for TDR vary from 14.8% reported in Romania, 8.8% in Serbia,\nand 7.8% in Greece to 2.4% in Slovenia \\[ 24 , 25 , 28 , 53 \\].\n\nThe surveillance drug resistance list consisting of non-polymorphic\nHIV-1 DRMs to monitor TDR was generated by an expert panel in 2009 and\nwas adopted by WHO and other institutions, and since then, it has been\nused to standardize monitoring of TDR in different countries \\[ 54 , 55\n\\]. In our study, TDR to NRTI was the most common (9.6%), with revertant\nT215S being the most frequent (8.1%) as in the study of Oroz et al. \\[\n31 \\]. SDRMs T215C/D/S are revertants of the primary zidovudine (AZT)\nresistance mutations T215Y/F that have continued to spread in drug-naïve\npersons and among Croatian patients since the early 90 s \\[ 56 \\].\n\nIn addition, we identified a rare mutation T69D in a male person\ninfected with CRF 39_BF, for whom Brazil was reported as the likely\ncountry of infection. T69D is a non-polymorphic NRTI-selected mutation\nthat reduces susceptibility to didanosine (ddI) and possibly d4T \\[ 57\n\\].\n\nResistance to NNRTIs has increased globally since 2013 in ART-naïve\nadults \\[ 52 \\]. Consistent with the previous study, the prevalence of\nSDRMs to NNRTI remained fairly the same, observed in 20 persons (7.4%).\nThe most frequent NNRTI was K103N, identified in 10 persons, followed by\nK101E, found in 9 persons. K103N is the most commonly transmitted\nnonpolymorphic NNRTI-drug-resistance mutation seen in people receiving\nnevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV), but when found in individuals\nbefore starting the WHO-recommended first-line regimen tenofovir\n(TDF)/lamivudine (3TC)/(EFV), it is associated with an increased risk of\nvirological failure \\[ 58 \\].\n\nBased on the results of the ATLAS and FLAIR clinical trials, long-acting\ninjectable cabotegravir and rilpivirine treatment (CAB/RPV LAI) has\nrecently been approved for use in virologically-suppressed patients \\[\n59 , 60 , 61 \\]. Since CAB/RPV LAI are currently being implemented\nacross Europe, risk factors for confirmed virological failure, including\nHIV-1 subtypes A1/A6 as well as rilpivirine-associated resistance,\nshould be carefully considered in various populations and geographic\nregions \\[ 60 , 62 \\].\n\nThe 2022 update of the International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) on\ndrug resistance mutations lists 16 mutations associated with decreased\nsusceptibility to rilpivirine (RPV) (K101E/P, E138A/G/K/Q/R, V179L,\nY181C/I/V, H221Y, F227C, M230I/L, and Y188L) \\[ 36 \\]. In this study, we\nidentified mutations E138A and E138K in 10 (3.7%) and 9 (3.3%) samples,\nrespectively. Mutation E138A occurs as a natural polymorphism,\nespecially in non-B subtypes \\[ 23 \\], and in the present study, E138A\nwas found in six subtype B and six subtype A1 sequences. E138K is a\nnon-polymorphic mutation selected in a high proportion of persons\nreceiving RPV, and in combination with K101E or the NRTI-resistance\nmutation M184I, it is sufficient to cause VF on a first-line\nRPV-containing regimen \\[ 63 , 64 , 65 , 66 \\].\n\nThe HIV Drug Resistance Stanford database defines E138A as a polymorphic\nmutation weakly associated with reduced susceptibility to etravirine\n(ETR) and RPV \\[ 35 \\], whereas the French HIV Resistance database\n(ANRS) defines E138A viruses as fully resistant to RPV \\[ 67 \\]. E138A\nwas not included in the surveillance drug resistance mutation (SDRMs)\nlist recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the\nsurveillance of transmitted HIV drug resistance \\[ 54 \\], but some\nresearchers have taken this mutation into account when monitoring\nNNRTI-drug resistance in treatment-naïve HIV-1 patients \\[ 14 , 68 , 69\n, 70 \\]. The higher prevalence of NNRTI-associated E138A and K103N\nmutations is inconsistent with previous reports \\[ 71 , 72 \\].\n\nFewer cases of SDRMs to PI were observed in the present study (1.5%)\nthan in the previous (2.5%) study \\[ 31 \\]. SDRMs to PI were identified\nin two persons with triple class resistance as well as in one person\nwith single and double class resistance. In addition, we identified two\npersons with triple class resistance infected with subtype B and B-D\nrecombinant with mutation patterns T215D, L100I, K103N, V32I, I47V, F53L\nand T215E, L100I, K103N, V32I, I47V, respectively.\n\nINSTIs, especially second-generation inhibitors, are a favourable\nfirst-line regimen recommended for ART-naïve PLHIV by the ART guidelines\n\\[ 73 \\]. TDR to INSTIs was first described in 2011 \\[ 74 , 75 \\], and\nto this date, a very low prevalence of TDR to INSTIs was reported \\[ 76\n, 77 , 78 , 79 \\]. The data on TDR resistance to INSTIs are limited,\nalthough some studies reported the absence or very low level of TDR in\nthe IN region \\[ 80 , 81 , 82 , 83 \\]. The first large study on\nresistance to INSTIs was conducted by the European SPREAD study where\nthe presence of INSTI-resistant variants in Europe (2006--2007) was\nanalysed before the introduction of INSTIs. A few years back,\nsurveillance of INSTI resistance was only recommended for patients with\nevidence of TDR to other drug classes and there was no obvious benefit\nof baseline TDR testing to INSTI in persons who entered clinical care \\[\n84 \\]. However, the situation has changed over the years, with\nsecond-generation integrase inhibitors such as dolutegravir being\nrecommended for first-line HIV treatment regimens following an increase\nin pre-treatment drug resistance to NNRTI-based regimens globally \\[ 85\n, 86 \\].\n\nResistance testing for INSTI was introduced in Croatia in 2015, and in\nthe beginning, was performed only on selected patients. Today,\nresistance testing to INSTIs in Croatia is performed on all newly\ndiagnosed HIV-infected persons. To this day, only two studies have been\npublished on resistance to INSTI in Croatia, regarding treatment-naïve\nand experienced patients, respectively \\[ 31 , 87 \\]. The present study\nis to date the largest cohort of ART-naïve persons with available\nresistance data on INSTI. The current study found no SDRMs in the IN\nregion, which is in concordance with other European countries that\nreported a similar absence or very low levels of SDRMS to INSTIs \\[ 88 ,\n89 , 90 , 91 , 92 , 93 \\]. Although no major INSTI mutations were found\nin this study, we identified a high prevalence of polymorphism S230N\nfound in 50 patients (18.9%), which is not associated with reduced INSTI\nsusceptibility. In addition, the integrase resistance associated\naccessory mutation L74I was found in seven patients and was more common\nin non-B subtypes. In the Stanford Resistance Database \\[ 35 \\], L74I is\nreported in combination with other integrase mutations with a prevalence\nof 3% to 20%, depending on subtype, but it is not listed on the IAS-USA\ndrug resistance mutations list \\[ 36 \\]. L74I has a minimal effect on\nINSTI susceptibility but can contribute to reduced susceptibility to\neach of the INSTIs when it occurs in association with primary INSTIs\nmutations \\[ 94 , 95 , 96 \\].\n\nAlthough no prevalence of resistance to integrase inhibitors was\nobserved, as expected, the study population consisted of a high\nproportion of late presenters, so the level of SDRMs to INSTI could be\nunderestimated due to a loss of DRM-possessing viruses in an actively\nreplicating viral pool, as suggested in a previous study \\[ 97 \\].\n\nOur sequence analysis confirmed that the majority of infections (73.3%)\nwere classified as subtype B, which is common in most western European\ncountries \\[ 23 \\] and countries of the Balkan region \\[ 98 \\], except\nfor Romania and Albania, where the most prevalent subtypes are F1\n(80.3%) and A1 (56.1%) \\[ 99 , 100 \\]. In previous nationwide studies\nreported by Oroz et al. \\[ 31 \\] and Grgic et al. \\[ 22 \\], subtype B\ninfection accounted for 91.3% and 89.0% of all new HIV infections,\nrespectively, so there was a slight decline of subtype B in favour of\nnon-B subtype infections in recent years. Subtype A1, subtype C, subtype\nF, CRF12_BF, and CRF01_AE were observed in \\>1% of the cohort. We also\nreported a significant number of different recombinant forms. In the\npresent study, 42 sequences were classified as recombinants, and the\nmajority of them were recombinants of subtype B and D identified in 29\nindividuals. In order to explore the transmission network of those\nsequences, we included 28 sequences of B-D recombinants in a separate\nphylogenetic analysis. Given that the majority of our cohort consisted\nof subtype B sequences, our phylogenetic analysis mainly focused on the\nsubtype B transmission network.\n\nPhylogenetic interference for subtype B sequences that consisted of new\n(2019--2022) and old (2014--2017) datasets as well as background\nsequences revealed 30 TCs (16 local TCs with Croatian sequences from the\nold and new datasets and 14 mixed TCs with non-Croatian sequences). All\nclusters were active, and newly formed clusters (53.3%) were somewhat\nmore represented than the expanding clusters (46.7%). Among the newly\nformed TCs, 25% were local and 75% were mixed clusters, indicating a\ncross-border transmission during the study period regardless of the\nongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The recent trend of increased risk factors,\nsuch as travelling abroad for chem-sex parties, is linked to\ncross-border transmission and was reported by some studies \\[ 101 , 102\n\\]. Since the origin of the background sequences was not available we\ndid not explore the geographic relationships between the clustered\nsequences.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis revealed that a total of 143/191 (74.9%) persons\nwere part of TCs, of which \\>50% were found in local TCs. The findings\nin our study are comparable with studies from other western and central\nEuropean countries, where HIV-1 infection is concentrated among MSM\ninfected with subtype B, but the proportion of clustered sequences was\n\\<60% \\[ 4 , 103 , 104 , 105 , 106 , 107 \\]. Less clustering was\nobserved in the present study than in the previous (74.9% vs. 86%), but\nit should be taken into consideration that fewer sequences were\nsubjected to the TC analysis than in the previous study due to fewer\nsubtype B infections.\n\nA total of 39/45 (86.7%) persons carrying SDRMs were observed in TCs\nwith forward transmission confirmed in 4 local clusters. We identified\none large, expanding T215S cluster with its sub-cluster T215S + L210W,\none expanding K101E cluster, and one newly formed K103N cluster. The\nprevious study identified a T215S cluster of 53 persons as the largest\nlocal SDRM cluster in Croatia \\[ 31 \\]. Phylodynamic analysis suggested\nthat this TC could be one of the earliest clusters in the country, with\nan estimated tMRCA in the year 1992. The largest local cluster\nidentified in the present study was also T215S, expanding throughout the\nstudy period. T215 revertants are one of the most common NRTI mutations\nfound in treatment-naïve persons \\[ 23 , 108 \\] and the high prevalence\nof T215S revertants in the Croatian HIV-1 cohort is likely due to this\nonce highly prevalent therapy in the country. Along with T215S, we found\none local K103N cluster where all people participating were MSM. Another\nrather large TC identified in this study was the K101E cluster\nconsisting of 21 sequences of different transmission risk groups from\nthe old and new datasets.\n\nIn the previous nationwide study, Oroz et al. identified one local TC\nwith a triple class resistance pattern with an origin back in 2008 \\[ 31\n\\]. In the present study, we identified two persons with triple class\nresistance with a similar pattern (T215D, L100I, K103N, V32I, I47V,\nF53L/T215E, L100I, K103N, V32I, I47V), but since they were not part of\nthe phylogenetic analysis, possible transmission was not determined.\n\nWhen combining the socio-demographic data of persons included in this\nanalysis with the results of the phylogenetic inference, we found that\ntransmission in clusters in Croatia involved young MSM infected with\nsubtype B, which highlights the importance of continued education on HIV\nprevention among that risk group and other persons at risk in order to\nreduce the risk of infection and minimize the transmission of the virus.\n\nThere are several explanations for the high TDR reported in our study.\nFirstly, the comparison of prevalences between different studies is\nchallenging due to the different algorithms used to identify TDR\nmutations. The WHO list for TDR surveillance has not been updated since\n2009 and tends to overestimate the importance of polymorphisms,\nrevertant mutations, and mutations only affecting the activity of drugs\nthat are no longer prescribed, and it does not take into account some\nimportant mutations that implicate currently used ARV \\[ 109 \\]. TDR is\nsignificantly lower (7.8%) when a Stanford mutation score is set at ≥60\nto identify the mutations with a high impact on drug susceptibility.\nSecondly, the main reason for the high TDR reported in our study is the\nlarge TC of MSM with SDRM T215S, which according to Oroz et al. dates\nback to 1992, and the relatively common K101E cluster, which dates back\nto 2008 \\[ 31 \\]. It should be emphasized that the current resistance\nprofiles do not compromise the current therapy, that is, the drugs that\nare used in treatment today.\n\nTo evaluate DS for identifying low abundance variants and to compare the\nresults with SS, we randomly selected 60 samples. This is the largest\ncomparison between these two methods conducted in Croatia so far. HIV-1\nminority variants exist in \\<15% of the entire HIV-1 viral population \\[\n110 \\] and DRMs in HIV-1 minority variants could compromise the\neffectiveness of ART treatment, especially for NNRTI-based regimens \\[\n111 \\]. A significant number of resistant variants in initial infection\ncan pass under the radar of the standard level of detection (\\>15%),\nespecially in late presenters \\[ 112 , 113 \\]. DS identified an\nadditional 49 SDRMs and the most frequent SDRMs identified by DS and\nmissed by SS was T215S. Complete and partial concordance between the two\nmethods was observed in 15.4% and 13.5%, respectively. In the majority\nof samples (65.4%), SS and DS disagreed but the discrepancies mostly\nreferred to samples where DS detected T215S as an additional mutation.\nOur results confirmed that disagreement between the two platforms is\npossible, as was reported by other studies \\[ 114 \\]. The major\nlimitations of our DS approach are the stochasticity of PCR itself; an\nadditional step of primer removal that can introduce errors, i.e.,\ndifferences in frequencies and mask alternative bases that complicate\nthe analysis; and the heterogeneous amplification efficiency of small\nPCR fragments that results in uneven coverage and a potential lack of\nminimum coverage. Regardless of these problems, our results show the\nvalue of this approach and that it is obtaining additional information.\n\n## 5. Conclusions\n\nThe results of our study give insight into the transmission dynamics of\nan HIV epidemic in Croatia that is locally driven by young MSM infected\nwith subtype B. We confirmed a high prevalence of SDRMs of 16.7% as well\nas forward transmission of resistance strains. Besides TDR associated\nwith NRTIs, the emergence of SDRMs to NNRTIs as well as the higher\nincidence of non-B subtypes observed in this study suggest important\nchanges in the pattern of primary resistance and viral diversity. The\nmajority of identified mutations were clinically relevant, which makes\nbaseline HIV resistance testing in Croatia of unquestionable importance.\nAlthough analysis of the clinical significance of SDRMs showed a\nfavourable virological background for INSTI-based treatment since no\nSDRMs to INSTI were observed, surveillance of TDR to INSTI should be\ncontinued in terms of ascertaining the role of polymorphic and\nnon-polymorphic mutations in the development of resistance. In addition,\nwe explored the performance of DS in detecting minority HIV-1 variants\nand demonstrated a valuable tool for HIV drug resistance assessment with\nan emphasis on the importance of standardization between the two\nmethods, especially in terms of the very well-established threshold for\ndrug resistance. Our findings demonstrate the importance of continuing\nto monitor SDRMs and transmission clusters in Croatia in order to\nfacilitate enhanced HIV prevention efforts.\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThis study was supported by the Croatian Science Foundation grant\nIP-2019-04-9702.\n\n## Data Availability Statement\n\nAll data analysed in this study are included in this published article\nand its Supplementary Information file .

We determined the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity in Bulgaria during 2012--2020 using polymerase sequences from 1053 of 2010 (52.4%) antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals. Sequences were analyzed for DRM using the WHO HIV SDRM list implemented in the calculated population resistance tool at Stanford University. Genetic diversity was inferred using automated subtyping tools and phylogenetics. Cluster detection and characterization was performed using MicrobeTrace. The overall rate of SDRMs was 5.7% (60/1053), with 2.2% having resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 1.8% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 2.1% to protease inhibitors (PIs), and 0.4% with dual-class SDRMs. We found high HIV-1 diversity, with the majority being subtype B (60.4%), followed by F1 (6.9%), CRF02_AG (5.2%), A1 (3.7%), CRF12_BF (0.8%), and other subtypes and recombinant forms (23%). Most (34/60, 56.7%) of the SDRMs were present in transmission clusters of different subtypes composed mostly of male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC), including a 14-member cluster of subtype B sequences from 12 MMSC and two males reporting heterosexual contact; 13 had the L90M PI mutation and one had the T215S NRTI SDRM. We found a low SDRM prevalence amid high HIV-1 diversity among ART-naive patients in Bulgaria during 2012--2020. The majority of SDRMs were found in transmission clusters containing MMSC, indicative of onward spread of SDRM in drug-naive individuals. Our study provides valuable information on the transmission dynamics of HIV drug resistance in the context of high genetic diversity in Bulgaria, for the development of enhanced prevention strategies to end the epidemic.\n\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the prevalence of surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) and HIV-1 genetic diversity using sequences from ART-naive individuals. It does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing or data.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 36016383\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be transmitted via parenteral, sexual, or vertical exposure routes. The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals. This retrospective study examines genetic sequences and clinical parameters like CD4+ T cell counts and viral load to understand the epidemiological and genetic characteristics of HIV-1 in the pediatric population in Rio de Janeiro.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 36146776\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: Monitoring HIV-1 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs) is important for disease surveillance. Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing. It focuses on the analysis of HIV-1 sequences and the identification of recombinant forms and drug resistance mutations.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 35283836\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Methods:\nWe analyzed 1,276 Ethiopian HIV-1 subtype C polymerase (pol sequences), including 144 newly generated sequences, collected from different parts of the country from 1986 to 2017. We employed state-of-art maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylodynamic analyses to comprehensively describe the evolutionary dynamics of the HIV-1 epidemic in Ethiopia. We used Bayesian phylodynamic models to estimate the dynamics of the effective population size (N) and reproductive numbers (Re) through time for the HIV epidemic in Ethiopia.\nResults:\nOur analysis revealed that the Ethiopian HIV-1 epidemic originated from two independent introductions at the beginning of the 1970s and 1980s from eastern and southern African countries, respectively, followed by epidemic growth reaching its maximum in the early 1990s. We identified three large clusters with a majority of Ethiopian sequences. Phylodynamic analyses revealed that all three clusters were characterized by high transmission rates during the early epidemic, followed by a decline in HIV-1 transmissions after 1990. Re was high (4–6) during the earlier time of the epidemic but dropped significantly and remained low (Re < 1) after the mid-1990s. Similarly, with an expected shift in time, the effective population size (N) steadily increased until the beginning of 2000, followed by a decline and stabilization until recent years. The phylodynamic analyses corroborated the modeled UNAIDS incidence and prevalence estimates.\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing or data. The focus is on the molecular epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the HIV-1 epidemic in Ethiopia, as well as the analysis of HIV-1 pol sequences.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 36298841\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: In an effort to evaluate the accuracy of HIV-1 phylogenies based on genomes of increasing length, we developed a comprehensive near-full-length HIV-1 genome RT–PCR assay and performed a comparative evaluation via phylogenetic analyses. To this end, we conducted comparative analyses of HIV-1 phylogenies derived based on HIV-1 PR/RT (2253–3359 in the HXB2 genome) and pol region (2253–5250 in the HXB2 genome) sequences isolated from 134 HIV-1-infected patients in Cyprus (2017–2019). The HIV-1 genotypic subtypes determined using six subtyping tools (REGA 3.0, COMET 2.3, jpHMM, SCUEAL, Stanford, and Geno2pheno) were compared to investigate the discrepancies generated among different tools. To evaluate the accuracy of defined HIV-1 phylogenies, the samples exhibiting at least one discrepant subtyping result among different subtyping tools in both PR/RT and pol regions or only in the pol region (n = 38) were selected for near-full-length HIV-1 genome (790–8795 in HXB2 genome) sequencing using a newly developed RT–PCR/sequencing assay. The obtained sequences were employed for HIV-1 genotypic subtype determination and subjected to comparative phylogenetic-based analyses. It was observed that 39.6% of the 134 samples presented discrepancies in the PR/RT region, while 28.4% presented discrepancies in the pol region. REGA 3.0 produced the fewest discrepancies collectively in both regions and was selected for subsequent subtyping and comparative phylogenetic analyses of near-full-length HIV-1 genome sequences. The analyses of near-full-length HIV-1 genome sequences identified 68.4% of the 38 ‘discrepant samples’ (n = 26) as belonging to uncharacterized recombinant HIV-1 strains, while 21.1% were circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) (n = 8) and 10.5% belonged to pure group M subtypes (n = 4). The findings demonstrated a significant reduction of 11.2% in discrepancies when pol region sequences were used compared to PR/RT region sequences, indicating that increased nucleotide sequence lengths are directly correlated with more consistent subtype classification. The results also revealed that if the discrepancy in pol region subtyping results persists, then there is a high likelihood (89.5%) that the query sequence is a recombinant HIV-1 strain, 68.4% of which belong to uncharacterized recombinant HIV-1 strains. The results of this study showed that REGA 3.0 presented the best performance in subtyping recombinant HIV-1 strains, while Stanford performed better in defining phylogenies of pure group M subtypes. The study highlights that, especially in populations with polyphyletic HIV-1 epidemics resulting in a high prevalence of recombinant HIV-1 strains, neither PR/RT nor pol region sequences are reliable for the determination of HIV-1 genotypic subtypes in samples showing discrepancies among different subtyping tools, and only near-full-length or full-length HIV-1 genome sequences are sufficiently accurate.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the phylogenetic analysis and subtyping of HIV-1 sequences from patient samples. There is no mention of in vitro drug susceptibility testing or data related to drug resistance assays in a laboratory setting.\nAnswer: No"}

We searched the PubMed, Embase, and\nCochrane databases to identify studies that reported DTG\nresistance-associated mutations (RAMs) emerging under selection\npressure. Our review showed that RAMs conferring resistance to DTG were\nrare in 2-drug and 3-drug regimens used in real-world cohorts,\ncorroborating data from clinical trials. The potency of DTG in\nmaintaining virologic suppression was demonstrated, even in cases of\npre-existing resistance to companion drugs in the regimen. Estimates of\nDTG RAMs depended on the population and certain risk factors, including\nmonotherapy, baseline resistance or lack of genotypic testing, treatment\nhistory and prior virologic failure, and suboptimal treatment adherence.\nThe RAMs detected after virologic failure, often in heavily\ntreatment-experienced individuals with prior exposure to integrase\nstrand transfer inhibitors, were G118R, E138K, G140A/C/R/S, Q148H/K/R,\nN155H, and R263K. Overall, these data highlight the durable\neffectiveness and high barrier to resistance of DTG as part of\ncombination antiretroviral therapy in a wide variety of settings.\n\n\n## 2. Methods\n\n### 2.1. Literature Review\n\nWe performed a comprehensive search of the National Center for\nBiotechnology Information PubMed, Embase (ProQuest), and Cochrane\ndatabases for all English-language papers as well as databases and\ncongress abstract books for all English-language congress presentation\nabstracts, using the search strings listed in Tables S1--S3 , last dated\n25 July 2023. A post hoc search was performed to include presentations\nfrom 2 additional congresses through 20 October 2023.\n\nPapers and abstracts were reviewed in multiple stages. First, duplicate\npublications were excluded, and the remaining publications were filtered\nby relevant study type (real-world evidence study, case study, or\nsystematic review/meta-analysis \\[inclusive of observational studies\\]).\nCase studies; systematic reviews; and cohort studies that did not\nidentify risk factors for treatment-emergent resistance to DTG (such as\nreporting use of DTG monotherapy; lack of viral load testing; or\nindividuals with prior VF, suboptimal adherence, or with extensive\ntreatment experience) were excluded. The remaining studies were then\nincluded in subsequent rounds of review if they discussed drug\nresistance, then direct or likely INSTI RAMs, then confirmed/likely\nclinical failure of any INSTI regimen to treatment-emergent resistance\nmutations. Finally, publications were further filtered by confirmed\nresistance to DTG and INSTI RAMs. A manual post hoc search of congress\nmaterial titles was performed during full-text screening to determine\nwhether any content was published but not identified in the database\nsearch. Congress materials linked to published articles, whether\nidentified in the database search or the manual post hoc search, were\nexcluded in favor of peer-reviewed published articles. If multiple\npublications had potential overlap of cohort populations, outcomes from\nthe study with the larger N and/or newer or more relevant data were\nused; however, all potential overlap may not have been identified.\n\n### 2.2. Data Extraction\n\nData were extracted independently by 4 individuals using standardized\nspreadsheets for manuscripts and congress abstracts. Discrepancies were\nhandled by jointly reviewing full-text articles, and studies deemed to\nbe linked to one another (i.e., reporting on the same cohort) were\nflagged. Study characteristics included region/country, type, design,\nand setting; regimen type; treatment duration; and follow-up period.\nCohort population information included total number of individuals\nincluded, number who were treatment-naive or treatment-experienced, and\nnumber with baseline resistance mutations. Information related to DTG\ntreatment failure included number of \"blips\" on DTG-based regimens\n(single measures of 50--200 copies/mL), number of individuals with\nconfirmed VF on DTG-based regimens, study definition of VF, rates of\nadherence, number of individuals with DTG-based treatment-emergent\nresistance mutations, type of mutation(s) present, and class of mutation\nresistance.\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. Treatment-Emergent Resistance by Regimen\n\nThe proportions of people living with HIV who experienced VF on\nDTG-based therapy and developed treatment-emergent integrase mutations\nby study and regimen are shown in Table 1 . While the definition of VF\nvaried, many included 1 or 2 consecutive measurements of \"detectable\"\nHIV-1 RNA \\[ 31 , 32 \\], or 1 or 2 consecutive measurements of HIV-1 RNA\n\\> or ≥50 copies/mL \\[ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 \\],\n\\>200 copies/mL \\[ 40 , 42 , 43 \\], \\>400 copies/mL \\[ 37 , 44 \\], ≥500\ncopies/mL \\[ 41 \\], and/or \\>1000 copies/mL \\[ 45 , 46 \\] as part of\nstudy-defined VF criteria. Many did not explicitly define VF criteria \\[\n47 , 48 , 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61\n, 62 \\]. Real-world data by regimen are described in further detail in\nthe following sections.\n\n#### 3.1.1. Dolutegravir/Lamivudine/Abacavir (DTG/3TC/ABC)\n\nTwo large cohort studies described VF and emergent resistance with\nDTG/3TC/ABC. One multicenter study in France evaluated RAMs in people\nliving with HIV and on first- or second-line INSTI-based ART from 2019\nto 2022 \\[ 33 \\]. Of the 3219 individuals receiving DTG-based regimens\nin the analysis, 179 (5.6%) experienced VF and 24 (0.75%) had\ntreatment-emergent INSTI RAMs (DTG/3TC/ABC, 11/1709 \\[0.64%\\]; DTG +\n3TC, 6/644 \\[0.93%\\]; DTG + RPV, 7/866 \\[0.81%\\]): G140S, Q148H, E92K,\nand N155H. Additionally, 7 individuals failing first-line DTG-based\nregimens had emergent M184V/I mutations and 14 failing second-line\nDTG-based regimens had emergent NRTI ( *n* = 7, M184V) and NNRTI ( *n* =\n3, E138A; *n* = 1 each, M230L, K101E, Y181C, V179L) mutations at VF.\n\nIn a Canadian database study of 928 individuals who started INSTI-based\nregimens between 2012 and 2014, 392 were on a DTG-based regimen with a\n3TC + ABC or TDF + FTC/3TC backbone. During the first year of follow-up,\n65 (16.6%) were \"not suppressed\" (rebound after suppression, lack of\nsuppression within 6 months, or consecutive blips); of these, 3 (4.6%)\nwere receiving DTG + 3TC + ABC and developed emergent INSTI mutations (\n*n* = 1, T66I; *n* = 2, R263K). Emergent NRTI mutations (M184V/I) were\ndetected in 4 individuals, including 2 with R263K mutations. In this\nstudy, suboptimal adherence (defined as \\<80% adherence to ART regimen)\nwas associated with a significant (2.5-fold) likelihood of developing\nemergent resistance \\[ 43 \\]. Emergent drug resistance was detected in\npeople with an apparent ≥95% ART prescription fill history, and the\nauthors speculated that the high viral load (\\>10,000 copies/mL)\nobserved in \\~50% of individuals at time of emergent drug resistance may\nindicate that treatment interruption or inconsistent ART adherence\noccurred. Overall, VF rates remain low across cohorts using DTG + 3TC +\nABC in real-world settings.\n\n#### 3.1.2. Dolutegravir/Lamivudine (DTG/3TC) or Dolutegravir/Rilpivirine (DTG/RPV)\n\nTwo single-center studies evaluated the effectiveness of switching to\nDTG-based 2-drug regimens. A retrospective review of data and\nprescription records for 561 people living with HIV who switched to or\ncontinued a DTG-based 2-drug regimen (DTG + 3TC, RPV, or FTC) between\nJanuary 2015 and October 2021 reported that 6 (1.1%) individuals\nexperienced VF: 4 using a DTG/3TC single-tablet regimen, 1 using a DTG +\n3TC multi-tablet regimen, and 1 using a DTG + RPV multi-tablet regimen\n\\[ 42 \\]. One case of VF was attributed to treatment non-adherence. Most\nindividuals (90%) did not have integrase resistance testing performed\nbefore starting DTG-based therapy. Treatment-emergent integrase (T66A,\nG118R, E138K) and reverse transcriptase (M184V, K103N) mutations were\ndetected in 1 individual (0.2%) after VF on a DTG-based regimen (either\nprevious TDF/3TC/DTG regimen or DTG + 3TC multi-tablet regimen at VF) \\[\n42 \\]. Another study of a cohort in Spain reported outcomes for 358\npeople living with HIV switching to DTG + 3TC before August 2019, which\nincluded 17 (4.7%) with a pre-existing M184V resistance mutation. Of the\n13 (3.6%) who experienced VF at week 144, none had pre-existing M184V\nand 1 had treatment-emergent INSTI (R263K) and NRTI (M184V) RAMs;\nadditionally, 1 had treatment-emergent M184V when treatment was changed\ndue to VF at Month 24 \\[ 39 \\].\n\nThe French Dat'AIDS multicenter cohort reported INSTI resistance\noutcomes in treatment-experienced, virologically suppressed individuals\nwho switched to DTG/RPV ( *n* = 799) and DTG + XTC ( *n* = 575; *n* =\n488 \\[84.9%\\] with 3TC) between January 2014 and September 2018.\nOverall, 464 (33.8%) had a history of prior VF \\[ 37 \\]. After a median\nfollow-up of \\~20 months, VF was reported in 30 (3.8%) individuals\nreceiving DTG/RPV and 15 (2.6%) receiving DTG + XTC. Of 23 individuals\nwith genotypes available at VF, 2 receiving DTG/RPV had\ntreatment-emergent NNRTI (1 with E138A and L100I; 1 with E138K and\nK101E) and INSTI RAMs (L74I and N155H, respectively, although\npolymorphic L741I alone does not reduce DTG susceptibility and N155H\nalone has minimal effect on DTG susceptibility). The low incidence of\ntreatment-emergent resistance with DTG + 3TC and DTG/RPV is consistent\nwith systematic literature reviews of their use in real-world settings\n\\[ 64 , 65 \\].\n\n#### 3.1.3. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate/Lamivudine/Dolutegravir (TLD)\n\nTwo multicenter studies described the transition from older ART regimens\nto TLD in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In Tanzania in March\n2019, eligible children ( *n* = 92) and adults ( *n* = 45) with\nhigh-level viremia (viral load ≥1000 copies/mL) on ART were surveyed for\nprevalence and patterns of acquired RAMs \\[ 62 \\]. Mutations conferring\nresistance to INSTIs, NNRTIs, and NRTIs were detected in 5.8%, 62.8%,\nand 44.5% of all individuals, respectively. Among the 82 individuals\nreceiving DTG-based regimens, 4 (4.9%) had at least 1 major INSTI RAM (\n*n* = 2, E138K; *n* = 2, G118R; *n* = 1, Q148K; *n* = 1, G140A; *n* = 1,\nT66A; *n* = 1, R263K). The 3 individuals with major INSTI RAMs with\nreverse transcriptase--protease sequences available also had multiple\nNNRTI mutations and mutations that conferred resistance to 3TC and TDF.\nRAMs could not be confirmed as treatment-emergent at VF, as historical\nor baseline resistance was not available or reported. In 2018, Malawi\ntransitioned 750,000 ART-experienced individuals to TLD in the absence\nof viral load testing. A prospective observational study of a subset of\nindividuals 1 year after this transition reported that 163/1892 (8.6%)\nwere viremic (HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL) at baseline; 89 of them were\nsuccessfully genotyped \\[ 41 \\]. At baseline, 42 (47.2%) individuals had\ndual 3TC and TDF resistance, 11 (12.4%) had resistance to 3TC alone, and\nnone had INSTI resistance. Two individuals (out of 1838 with ≥2 viral\nload tests, or 0.1%) experienced VF and DTG resistance (R263K and G118R)\nat month 6 of treatment. Both were viremic and resistant to 3TC and TDF\nat baseline, suggesting an incidence of INSTI resistance of 4.7% (2/42)\namong individuals with 3TC and TDF resistance who were potentially\nreceiving only 1 fully active agent (DTG).\n\nA study based on database searches investigated 113 treatment-naive\nindividuals with failure of first-line TLD therapy in Brazil \\[ 31 \\].\nSeven individuals (6.2%) had major INSTI RAMs at VF; of these\nindividuals, 4 harbored the DTG-specific R263K substitution. In\naddition, 2 people with R263K also had reverse transcriptase mutations\n(K70E and M184V). Overall, 13 (11.5%) individuals had RAMs selective for\ntenofovir and/or 3TC ( *n* = 9, M184V; *n* = 4, K70E and M184V) \\[ 31\n\\]. A single-hospital study in Nigeria in 2021 showed that among 4263\npeople living with HIV and on a DTG-based regimen for at least 6 months,\n281 (6.6%) had a viral load \\>1000 copies/mL. From this group,\nresistance testing was completed in 33 individuals on TLD, 1 of whom was\nknown to have vertically acquired HIV and had detectable INSTI RAMs \\[\n46 \\]. In addition to multiple INSTI RAMs, including E138K, G118R, T66A,\nand R263K, this individual showed high-level resistance to NNRTIs and\nNRTIs. Of individuals with resistance testing, 24 (72.7%) had NNRTI\nRAMs, 17 (51.5%) had NRTI RAMs, and 4 (12.1%) had PI RAMs.\n\nIn LMICs, the risk of emergent resistance may be higher due to\ninfrequent viral load monitoring. A study of 716 people living with HIV\nwho switched to TLD in Mozambique between August 2021 and February 2022\nidentified VF in 216 individuals and successfully obtained genotypes\nfrom 167 \\[ 45 \\]. Intermediate- to high-level DTG resistance was\nobserved in 35/167 (21.0%) individuals and occurred more frequently in\nthose with viremia (19.4%) or lack of viral load testing (40.5%) before\nthey switched to TLD. In this study, the INSTI mutations detected were\nG118R, G140A/C/R/S, Q148H/K/R, N155H, Y143C/H/R, and R263K. Moreover,\n10/35 (28.6%) demonstrated resistance to each drug in the regimen \\[ 45\n\\].\n\nThe results from the DTG RESIST study, which includes multiple cohorts\nthat are part of the ART Cohort Collaboration and the International\nepidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (Europe, North America, South\nAfrica), highlight the importance of genotypic resistance testing,\nparticularly in individuals with prior treatment experience \\[ 48 \\].\nAmong 599 people living with HIV included in the analysis, 86 (14.4%)\ndeveloped at least 1 major or minor INSTI RAM, and 20 (3.3%) had \\>1\nINSTI RAM. While 563 (94.0%) individuals retained full DTG\nsusceptibility, 17 (2.8%) and 6 (1.0%) showed intermediate- and\nhigh-level resistance, respectively. The most frequently detected INSTI\nRAM was R263K ( *n* = 10). Factors from this analysis associated with\nDTG resistance included DTG monotherapy, DTG + 3TC 2-drug therapy, and\nNRTI backbone resistance. There was a strong association between DTG and\nNRTI resistance in sensitivity analyses of individuals with only 3TC and\nTDF resistance. Furthermore, evaluation of individuals with available\nhistorical genotypes suggested that prior resistance to the NRTI\nbackbone was associated with an increased likelihood of\ntreatment-emergent DTG resistance \\[ 48 \\].\n\n### 3.2. Risk Factors for Treatment-Emergent Resistance\n\nOur review of INSTI RAMs highlighted several factors associated with\nresistance development, including suboptimal adherence, DTG monotherapy,\nlack of viral load testing, prior VF, and extensive treatment\nexperience.\n\n#### 3.2.1. DTG Monotherapy\n\nThe efficacy and high barrier to resistance of DTG have prompted\ninvestigation into the possibility of its use as monotherapy. Three\npublished reports of 2 cohorts treated with DTG monotherapy describe VF\noutcomes with resistance testing. These single-center European studies\nincluded individuals with extensive prior ART experience and suppressed\nviremia for at least 6 months before switching to DTG monotherapy. In\none study (N = 28), 3 people living with HIV with previous exposure to\nfirst-generation INSTIs RAL or EVG experienced VF during 24 weeks of DTG\nmonotherapy. Treatment-emergent DTG resistance (E138K, Q140A, Q148R, *n*\n= 1; N155H, *n* = 1) was detected in 2 individuals \\[ 63 \\]. A\nsubsequent report of this study included 61 people living with HIV who\nwere on DTG monotherapy for a median of 100 weeks, and no additional\ncases of VF or INSTI resistance were observed \\[ 40 \\]. In a separate\nstudy of 31 individuals with 24 weeks of follow-up, there was 1 case of\nVF with DTG resistance (Q148H, G140S) and a minor PI-related mutation\n(A71V) \\[ 49 \\]. Although these real-world studies show a relatively low\nincidence of INSTI resistance, it is worth noting that DTG monotherapy\ndemonstrated inferiority to combination ART at a 48-week follow-up in a\nrandomized non-inferiority trial, with treatment-emergent INSTI RAMs\ndetected in 3/95 (3.2%) participants receiving DTG monotherapy (S230R,\nR263K, N155H) \\[ 66 \\]. Overall, the risks of monotherapy appear to\noutweigh any potential benefits.\n\n#### 3.2.2. Prior Virologic Failure\n\nBased on data from a large Italian cohort in the ARCA database, RAMs\nwere evaluated in 107 INSTI-experienced viremic people living with HIV\n\\[ 51 \\]. Of 13 people receiving DTG-based regimens, 1 (7.7%) had an\nR263K mutation before INSTI treatment; 3 (23.1%) had major\ntreatment-emergent INSTI RAMs at VF (2 each with N155H, G140S, and\nQ148H; and 1 each had Y143C/H/R and E138A).\n\nA 6-year retrospective study in Germany included 655 (2017--2018), 710\n(2019--2020), and 667 (2021--July 2022) samples from individuals with\nviremia taking second-generation INSTIs \\[ 61 \\]. Approximately half of\nthe samples from individuals with historical resistance data had\nprevious NRTI and/or NNRTI RAMs. Emergence of INSTI resistance was rare,\nwith no major INSTI RAMs detected in the 3% of samples with VF. Among\nindividuals using DTG-based regimens (N not reported), new INSTI RAMs\ndeveloped in 4 individuals at VF (R263K) and were detected in 4\nadditional individuals at VF without historical resistance results to\nconfirm treatment emergence (R263K, *n* = 2; G118R, *n* = 2; T66I, *n* =\n1; E138K, *n* = 1). Furthermore, reverse transcriptase RAMs developed in\n2 individuals at VF (K70E, K101E) and were detected in 4 additional\nindividuals at VF (M184V/I, *n* = 4; L210F, *n* = 1; K103R, *n* = 1; and\nV179I, *n* = 1) without historical context to confirm emergence.\n\n#### 3.2.3. Heavily Treatment-Experienced Populations\n\nIn the multicenter COPEDOL study in France, 459 people living with HIV\nwith treatment failure on prior ART were treated with DTG-based regimens\nfor 24 months \\[ 38 \\]. Individuals had prior exposure to an average of\n7 ART regimens ( *n* = 150 \\[32.7%\\] with previous INSTI exposure), and\nof 311 individuals with genotyping analysis, \\~25% had only 1 fully\nactive ARV available. In this HTE population, 94 (21.4%) cases of VF\nwere reported in 440 individuals, 5 of whom developed INSTI RAMs;\nhowever, a G140A/C/S mutation was detected at study inclusion in 1 of\nthese 5.\n\nFirst-generation INSTIs (RAL and EVG) have a relatively low barrier to\nresistance, and people living with HIV with prior exposure to these\ndrugs can develop RAMs that also confer resistance to DTG \\[ 12 \\]. In a\nretrospective multicenter cohort study of 467 individuals who\nexperienced VF while on a DTG-based regimen in France and Italy, 58\n(12.4%) had at least 1 major INSTI RAM \\[ 35 \\]. INSTI RAMs were more\nfrequent in individuals with first-generation INSTI experience (21.2%;\n*n* = 46) compared with INSTI-naive individuals (3.9%; *n* = 9). Of the\n9 INSTI-naive individuals with INSTI RAMs at VF, 2 had NRTI RAMs\n(M184V), and 1 had NNRTI RAMs (K103N and E138G). Among RAMs specifically\nassociated with DTG resistance, R263K and G118R had a prevalence of\n\\<2%. An Italian PRESTIGIO database analysis of 190 people living with\nHIV with INSTI resistance from first-generation INSTI exposure reported\nthat, of 142 individuals with available baseline resistance data, 105\n(73.9%) had ≥1 major INSTI mutation \\[ 36 \\]. Moreover, 48 individuals\n(25.3%) experienced VF with twice-daily DTG + OBT, 16 of whom had\nfollow-up resistance testing, which showed minimal evolution of\nmutations. Presence of Q148H/K/N/R and G140A/C/S at baseline plus 1 or\nmore INSTI RAMs was associated with a significantly shorter time to VF.\nNevertheless, this study suggests the benefit of DTG + OBT in a\npopulation with few treatment options.\n\nA study evaluated resistance in people living with HIV-1 subtype C who\nexperienced VF on DTG and/or RAL-based ART in public health facilities\nin Botswana, where HIV-1 subtype C is dominant \\[ 44 \\]. Plasma samples\nfrom 34 individuals were sequenced and 11 (32.4%) had INSTI RAMs; of\nthese, 8 had treatment failure on a DTG-based regimen at resistance\nsampling. The most frequently detected RAMs among those failing on a\nDTG-based regimen were E138K ( *n* = 5), S147G ( *n* = 3), Q148R ( *n* =\n3), and N155H ( *n* = 2; full list in Table 1 ), with NRTI, NNRTI,\nand/or PI RAMs also present. In a separate South African cohort of 43\npeople living with HIV and on third-line ART ( *n* = 34 \\[79.1%\\] with\nRAL exposure and *n* = 4 \\[9.3%\\] with DTG exposure), 3 (7.0%)\nindividuals demonstrated intermediate- to high-level DTG resistance at\nVF \\[ 52 \\]. One individual had multiple RAMs (T66A, E138K, Y143R,\nS147G, Q95K, and T97A), while the other 2 had previous exposure to RAL\nand had mutations conferring cross-resistance to DTG.\n\nAmong the congress abstracts and posters reviewed, 3 studies reported a\ncombined prevalence of INSTI resistance of 9.4% (130/1376) among HTE\npeople living with HIV or those with prior exposure to first-generation\nINSTIs and/or multi-class resistance, with resistance testing available\nat VF \\[ 45 , 55 , 57 \\]. Three studies of INSTI-experienced individuals\nand/or those with prior VF demonstrated a combined prevalence of 15.9%\n(10/63) for mutations conferring DTG resistance in individuals on\nDTG-based regimens with resistance testing available at VF, though\nanother study reported resistance in 2 individuals on DTG-based regimens\nout of 147 total individuals using INSTIs (1.4%) \\[ 56 , 58 , 60 \\].\nThese studies together indicate that even in people living with HIV who\nare HTE, emergence of mutations that confer major resistance to DTG is\nlow compared with resistance to other drug classes.\n\n#### 3.2.4. Suboptimal Adherence\n\nIntermittent treatment adherence can increase the likelihood of\nmutations developing, as the drug would be present but with insufficient\npressure to fully suppress replication \\[ 67 \\], but it is challenging\nto determine rates of adherence among people living with HIV in clinical\ncohorts. In a Spanish cohort of 307 people living with HIV who were\nprescribed DTG, 3 individuals discontinued due to VF, 1 of whom\ndeveloped DTG resistance \\[ 59 \\]. In another Spanish cohort of 33\npeople living with HIV, 1 individual with previous VF on a RAL-based\nregimen experienced VF with DTG monotherapy; although no INSTI RAMs were\ndetected at VF, the individual developed G118R 24 weeks into the study,\nwhich confers resistance to DTG \\[ 50 \\]. Investigators from these\ncohorts attributed DTG resistance selection and/or VF to suboptimal\nadherence; however, other risk factors such as prior VF with a\nfirst-generation INSTI and DTG monotherapy may have additionally\ncontributed to emergent drug resistance in these cases.\n\nIn another cohort of 174 people living with HIV with INSTI resistance, 4\nout of 5 individuals with DTG resistance mutations were non-adherent to\ncurrent or previous DTG-based treatment \\[ 47 \\]. Detected INSTI\nresistance mutations were R263K, E157Q, and S230R. In addition to\nnon-adherence, the authors speculated that the presence of NRTI or NNRTI\nresistance mutations (e.g., M184V and K103N, respectively) may have also\ncontributed to the development of DTG resistance. Another study\nsimilarly found infrequent VF ( *n* = 13) among a cohort of 358 people\nliving with HIV who switched to DTG/3TC, and only 1 individual (0.3%;\n1/358) developed the intermediate-level INSTI resistance mutation R263K\n\\[ 39 \\]. The authors speculated that VF may have occurred due to\nsuboptimal adherence.\n\nLarger analyses have shown similar findings. Among 955 people living\nwith HIV in Ukraine and Poland, multiple INSTI RAMs (E138K, Q148R, and\nR263K) were detected in 1 individual with suspected suboptimal adherence\nafter intermittent TLD exposure \\[ 54 \\]. In a large analysis of 1892\nindividuals who transitioned to TLD, 0.8% experienced VF with suspected\nsuboptimal adherence, 2 (0.1%) of whom had DTG resistance (R263K and\nG118R) after 6 months of treatment \\[ 41 \\].\n\n### 3.3. Treatment-Emergent Resistance in People Living with HIV-2\n\nA database search of 319 people living with HIV-2 from the Spanish HIV-2\nnational register identified 10 individuals who had experienced\ntreatment failure on a RAL-based regimen and had an available integrase\nsequence through December 2015 \\[ 53 \\]. Among these, 9 had INSTI RAMs\nand 5 switched to a DTG-based regimen. After a median duration of 14\nmonths, 3 individuals who had switched to a DTG-based regimen\nexperienced virologic rebound with emergent Q148K/R ( *n* = 2) and G118R\n( *n* = 1) RAMs \\[ 53 \\]. This study provides an evaluation of the DTG\nresistance barrier in the context of HIV-2, for which treatment options\nare more limited, with baseline INSTI RAMs.\n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nHere, we conducted a comprehensive review of VF and treatment-emergent\nRAMs among people living with HIV receiving DTG-based regimens in\nreal-world settings, using publications and congress data from 2013 to\n2023. Published reports of real-world evidence are consistent with data\nfrom DTG clinical trial programs showing that development of mutations\nconferring resistance to INSTIs in individuals receiving DTG-based\n2-drug and 3-drug regimens is infrequent. Risk factors associated with\ngreater likelihood of emergence of DTG resistance include DTG\nmonotherapy, previous VF on first-generation INSTIs, switching of\ntreatment-experienced individuals in the absence of viral load and/or\ngenotypic resistance testing, and suboptimal ART adherence. These\nfactors suggest that despite the effectiveness of DTG-based regimens in\nmany different populations, clinical vigilance regarding patient\nhistories, frequency of viral load testing, and adherence counseling is\nrequired for selection of the appropriate ART regimen. Moreover,\ncontinued monitoring of emergent resistance is necessary in large\nreal-world cohorts.\n\nHistorical or baseline resistance information is not always available in\nreal-world settings at treatment initiation or switch. Randomized\ncontrolled trials of a DTG 2-drug regimen for treatment simplification,\nincluding TANGO and SALSA, used baseline resistance and prior VF as\nexclusion criteria \\[ 24 , 68 \\]. In contrast, 2 studies that assessed\nuse of DTG/3TC (STAT, N = 131) and DTG + 3TC (DOLAVI, N = 88) in a\ntest-and-treat setting reported that a relatively high proportion of\nindividuals initiating treatment achieved virologic suppression (76.3%\n\\[100/131\\] and 86.4% \\[76/88\\] by Snapshot algorithm, respectively)\nover 48 weeks \\[ 20 , 69 \\]. Both studies required baseline resistance\ntesting at study entry, but results were not available until week 4 in\nSTAT, and 84.1% of individuals started same-day treatment in DOLAVI. In\na retrospective analysis of the TANDEM sub-cohort of treatment-naive\nadults initiating DTG/3TC (N = 126), high suppression rates (\\>83%) were\nobserved regardless of test-and-treat status after a median 1.3-year\n(test-and-treat, *n* = 61) or 1.2-year (not test-and-treat, *n* = 62)\nfollow-up \\[ 70 \\]. Though 71.9% of the Spanish REDOLA cohort study (N =\n135) initiated DTG/3TC without a baseline resistance test, high\nvirologic suppression rates (intention-to-treat missing = failure\nanalysis, 85.2% \\[115/135\\]; per-protocol analysis, 96.6% \\[115/119\\])\nwere reported at week 48. Of note, 1 individual with M184V detected in\ntheir baseline resistance test achieved virologic suppression by week 6\n\\[ 71 \\]. A meta-analysis of people living with HIV who switched to\nDTG + 3TC reported low estimated proportions with VF based on data from\nreal-world cohorts at weeks 24, 48, and 96 regardless of the presence of\npre-switch M184V/I mutations (with M184V/I: 0.01, 0.03, and 0.04,\nrespectively; without M184V/I, 0.00, 0.02, and 0.02, respectively),\nwhich were consistent with estimated proportions with VF in participants\nwith historical M184V/I from interventional studies (0.00, 0.00, and\n0.00, respectively) \\[ 72 \\]. Rates of VF were also infrequent 24 weeks\nafter first-line initiation of DTG + 3TC ( *n* = 106) or DTG + TDF/XTC (\n*n* = 108) without baseline resistance testing in the randomized phase 4\nD2ARLING trial, where no RAMs were observed at VF for the 1 participant\ntaking DTG + TDF/XTC who experienced VF \\[ 73 \\]. Findings from these\nstudies and low prevalence of pre-treatment INSTI resistance show that\nDTG-based regimens result in similar treatment outcomes when\npre-treatment resistance testing is not available; however, caveats may\narise if other risk factors are present (e.g., previous VF).\n\nIn general, INSTI mutations were infrequently detected at VF across\nstudies identified in this review, even in cohorts where individuals had\nprevious VF and/or historical mutations. VF rates ranged from 1% to 60%\namong the 16 lead studies reporting VF outcomes \\[ 33 , 36 , 37 , 38 ,\n39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 45 , 46 , 49 , 50 , 53 , 58 , 59 \\] for\nindividuals on DTG-based regimens (excluding 8 lead studies with 100% VF\nrates due to study design \\[ 31 , 32 , 35 , 44 , 48 , 52 , 60 , 62 \\],\ni.e., resistance analyses in populations failing treatment); of note,\nthe highest rates (50% and 60%) were observed in cohorts with N ≤ 5 \\[\n53 , 58 \\]. These results are consistent with other real-world studies\n\\[ 69 , 70 , 71 \\] reporting low VF rates and/or infrequent INSTI RAM\ndevelopment in people receiving DTG-based treatment and reinforce the\nhigh barrier to resistance observed in interventional studies in\nART-naive and ART-experienced individuals \\[ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19\n, 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 27 , 73 \\]. However, models from a large\n(N = 669) Italian cohort of suppressed-switch individuals receiving\nDTG + 3TC showed that previous VF on an INSTI-based regimen was\nassociated with an increased risk of future VF (adjusted hazard ratio,\n5.51; 95% CI, 1.15--26.50) \\[ 74 \\], and results from the VIKING-3 trial\nshowed that participants with Q148 + ≥2 mutations had 96% lower odds of\nsuppressing within 24 weeks compared with those without Q148 mutations\n\\[ 26 \\]. Thus, although DTG-inclusive regimens are recommended by\nguidelines for individuals with VF \\[ 1 , 3 , 6 \\], including with\nlimited INSTI resistance detected (e.g., due to VF with RAL or EVG, as\nin VIKING-3), it is important to consider an individual's treatment\nhistory.\n\nWe also evaluated studies of DTG-based ART regimens for HTE individuals\nwith few treatment options. Since the introduction of INSTIs, the\nprevalence of HTE people living with HIV has decreased from 7.5% in 2006\nto \\<1% in 2012 through 2017 \\[ 75 \\]. Though this decreased prevalence\nlikely reflects the improvement of ART regimens and increased options\nfor treatment over the last several decades, HTE people can still harbor\nmulti-class resistance that could potentially include INSTI RAMs \\[ 76\n\\]. Higher prevalence of RAMs was observed in specific groups, such as\nthose who failed and had virus with RAMs to first-generation INSTIs.\nStill, DTG + OBT was effective in treating people with ≥1 INSTI mutation\nat baseline, and where VF did occur in this population, patterns of RAMs\nhad sometimes not evolved significantly. Higher incidence of\ntreatment-emergent resistance was also noted in studies of smaller\ncohorts with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 and previous exposure to RAL.\nThis frequently corresponded with detection of certain RAMs, such as\nQ148H/K/N/R, which was shown in controlled trials to reduce\nsusceptibility to DTG when present with at least 2 other mutations \\[ 75\n\\]. The DTG resistance mutation R263K was detected in some cases of VF,\nbut frequency was low. As real-world evidence suggests, treatment of\nthis unique group of individuals requires a thorough evaluation of the\nreasons for prior VF and RAM profiles as well as an understanding of ARV\nmechanisms of action and pathways to resistance.\n\nReal-world cohort data suggest that intermittent, suboptimal treatment\nadherence is a relatively common contributing factor to the emergence of\nmutations conferring resistance to DTG. Adherence is difficult to\nestimate from cohort studies, with most relying on subjective\nmeasurements such as self-reporting and provider evaluations \\[ 77 \\].\nEven more objective measures such as electronic monitoring and pill\ncounting have challenges, where the latter can generate inaccurate\nestimates of adherence due to factors such as surplus medication or the\nassumption that a dose removed from its container is equivalent to an\nindividual taking the medication. In the phase 3 GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2\nstudies, a post hoc analysis showed that rates of virologic suppression\nwere lower among those with more suspected missed doses \\[ 78 \\].\nImportantly, the 1 participant in the GEMINI studies who developed an\nemergent INSTI RAM (R263R/K) had a previous elevated viral load\nattributed to treatment non-adherence \\[ 19 \\]. Real-world data showed\nthat suboptimal adherence may increase the risk of RAM selection,\nparticularly in individuals with prior VF and INSTI exposure. Factors\nsuch as persistent low-level viremia (ranging from \"detectable\" HIV-1\nRNA levels up to \\<1000 copies/mL) may point toward intermittent ART\nuse. Indeed, analyses from a cohort of 240 adults receiving DTG/3TC\nindicated a significant association between adherence and odds of\nachieving and maintaining HIV-1 RNA \\<50 or \\<200 copies/mL ( *p* \\<\n0.0001) over 681 person-years of follow-up and that \\<80% adherence (by\nproportion of days covered) was associated with poorer virologic\noutcomes \\[ 79 \\]. Although suboptimal adherence is generally defined as\n\\<80% adherence to treatment \\[ 80 , 81 \\], recent studies have not\ndetermined a specific proportion of missed doses to correlate with\nresistance development, especially as drug resistance mutations are less\nlikely to develop with longer periods of treatment non-adherence due to\ninsufficient drug pressure \\[ 67 \\]. While DTG-based regimens have\ndemonstrated \"forgiveness\" in their ability to maintain suppression\ndespite suboptimal adherence in clinical trials, to avoid the risk of\nemergent RAMs, emphasis should be placed on patient counseling and\nimplementation of objective measures in addition to self-reporting.\n\nConsidering that most recommended regimens are daily single-tablet oral\nmedications for individuals without prior treatment experience or VF,\nadherence is expected to improve as regimens become more convenient. A\nsystematic literature review of ART adherence in real-world\nobservational study settings reported that in 9/11 publications\nevaluating the association between number of tablets in the regimen and\nadherence to treatment, use of single-tablet regimens was associated\nwith significantly higher adherence compared with multi-tablet regimens\n\\[ 82 \\]. Furthermore, 13/18 studies showed that higher adherence was\nassociated with greater virologic suppression. Though these findings\nsupport the high barrier to resistance of DTG-based regimens, people\nliving with HIV should be encouraged to maintain optimal adherence\n(i.e., \"every dose, every day\").\n\nIn accordance with the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database \\[ 83 , 84\n\\], we found that in cases of VF on DTG-based therapy with RAM\nemergence, the common major mutations detected were at residues G118,\nE138, G140, Q148, and in some cases R263. These mutations were often\ndetected in HTE individuals and those with prior INSTI exposure or lack\nof sufficient backbone activity. While substitutions at one of these\npositions alone, such as E138, does not significantly decrease\nsusceptibility to INSTIs, they have a greater effect when detected in\ncombination \\[ 85 , 86 \\]. The concurrent presence of the Q148H/K/R and\nG140A/C/S mutations, for example, contributes significantly to the\nreduction of susceptibility to multiple INSTIs, including DTG \\[ 87 \\].\nFurthermore, mutations outside of the integrase gene that may affect\nINSTI efficacy have recently been reported, such as those at the 3′PPT\n\\[ 88 , 89 , 90 \\]. While these have been detected in vitro from passage\nexperiments using DTG and rarely in individuals taking INSTI-containing\nregimens, further studies are needed to evaluate their impact and\nmonitor for novel resistance mutations. However, because this review\nonly identified studies that detected and reported integrase mutations,\nthe overall incidence of treatment-emergent INSTI resistance cannot be\nassessed.\n\nIn summary, the use of DTG-based 2- and 3-drug regimens in real-world\nsettings over the last decade has allowed people living with HIV to\nachieve or maintain virologic suppression with low incidence of emergent\nresistance. Risk of VF and treatment-emergent resistance to INSTIs are\nassociated with an individual's prior treatment history, virologic\nstatus and baseline genotype, and adherence to ART. Careful treatment\nselection and frequent viral load and genotypic testing is required for\nHTE populations.\n\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThis research was funded by ViiV Healthcare.\n\n## Data Availability Statement\n\nNo new data were created or analyzed in this study.

Recently, WHO has emphasized the need to fast-track the transition to dolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral (ARV) treatments. However, continued surveillance of INSTI resistance is recommended. In this study, clinical, epidemiological, and virological features associated with INSTI resistance diagnosed in Spain were analyzed. Samples collected between 2008 and 2021 from HIV-1-infected patients were analyzed in integrase, protease, and reverse transcriptase using Sanger population sequencing. ARV drug resistance was evaluated with the Stanford University HIVdb program. Among 2,696 patients, 174 (6.5%) had INSTI resistance, all of them to first-generation INSTIs, and 71 (2.6%) had also resistance to second-generation INSTIs. Of these, only 5 individuals were exposed to DTG as the only INSTI, in whom resistance development was associated with poor treatment adherence and/or resistance to other ARV classes. Of newly HIV-1-diagnosed individuals, 0.92% harbored INSTI-resistant viruses, with low prevalences maintained along time, and only one had low-level resistance to DTG. Persons who inject drugs, age over 39 years, resistance to other ARV classes, and longer time from diagnosis were associated with INSTI resistance (p < 0.001). Non-subtype B INSTI-resistant viruses lacked the Q148H + G140S resistance pathway and showed lower INSTI resistance levels than subtype B viruses. In conclusion, INSTI resistance is uncommon and associated with long-term infections, older age and additional resistance to other ARV drug classes, and is rare in newly diagnosed HIV-1 infections. Our results also support the preferential use of DTG-containing regimens in first-line treatments, although surveillance of INSTI resistance is encouraged.\"\nRationale: The paper focuses on the analysis of drug resistance mutations and their prevalence in patient samples, but it does not mention conducting in vitro drug susceptibility tests.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 37112915\nQuestion ID: 16\nQuestion: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\nEvidence: Most patients (52.4%) were NNRTI-experienced in the DTG plus RPV group, and (42.2%) had INSTI in the DTG plus 3TC group.

A similar case from South Africa has been described, of a treatment experienced patient who developed resistance to DTG after taking DTG 50 mg once a day with rifampicin, instead of the recommended twice daily dosing. Rifampicin is an inducer of the UGT1A1 and CYP3A4 pathways by which DTG is metabolised, resulting in reduced serum DTG concentrations.

We compared the effectiveness\nof DTG versus the previously recommended ritonavir-boosted lopinavir\n(LPV/r) regimen for second-line treatment in South Africa.\n\n### Methods\n\nIn this retrospective observational cohort study, we used routinely\ncollected, de-identified data from 59 primary health-care facilities in\neThekwini Municipality, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We included people\nliving with HIV aged 15 years or older with virological failure (defined\nas two consecutive viral loads of ≥1000 copies per mL at least 56 days\napart) on first-line NNRTI-based ART containing tenofovir disoproxil\nfumarate (TDF) and who switched to second-line ART. Our primary outcomes\nwere retention in care and viral suppression (\\<50 copies per mL) at 12\nmonths after starting second-line treatment. We used modified Poisson\nregression models to compare these outcomes between second-line regimens\n(zidovudine \\[AZT\\]/emtricitabine or lamivudine \\[XTC\\]/DTG;\nTDF/XTC/DTG; and AZT/XTC/LPV/r).\n\n### Findings\n\nWe included 1214 participants in our study, of whom 729 (60%) were\nfemale and 485 (40%) were male, and whose median age was 36 years (IQR\n30--42). 689 (57%) were switched to AZT/XTC/LPV/r, 217 (18%) to\nAZT/XTC/DTG, and 308 (25%) to TDF/XTC/DTG. Compared with AZT/XTC/LPV/r\n(75%), retention in care was higher with AZT/XTC/DTG (86%, adjusted risk\nratio \\[aRR\\]=1·14, 95% CI 1·03--1·27; adjusted risk difference\n\\[aRD\\]=10·89%, 95% CI 2·01 to 19·78) but similar with TDF/XTC/DTG (77%,\naRR=1·01, 0·94--1·10; aRD=1·04%, --5·03 to 7·12). Observed retention in\ncare was lower with TDF/XTC/DTG than with AZT/XTC/DTG, although in\nmultivariable analysis evidence for a difference was weak (aRR=0·89,\n0·78--1·01, p=0·060; aRD=--9·85%, --20·33 to 0·63, p=0·066). Of 799\nparticipants who were retained in care with a 12-month viral load test\ndone, viral suppression was higher with AZT/XTC/DTG (59%; aRR=1·25,\n1·06--1·47; aRD=11·57%, 2·37 to 20·76) and higher with TDF/XTC/DTG (61%;\naRR=1·30, 1·14--1·48; aRD=14·16%, 7·14 to 21·18) than with AZT/XTC/LPV/r\n(47%).\n\n### Interpretation\n\nThese findings from routine care support further implementation of\nWHO\\'s recommendation to use DTG instead of LPV/r in people living with\nHIV who experience virological failure while receiving first-line\nNNRTI-based ART.\n\n### Funding\n\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n### Translation\n\nFor the isiZulu translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials\nsection.\n\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study design and participants\n\nWe did a retrospective observational cohort study with de-identified,\nroutinely collected data from South Africa\\'s ART programme in 59 of\napproximately 100 public sector primary health-care clinics in the\neThekwini Municipality of the KwaZulu-Natal province. The study was\napproved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of the University\nof Kwazulu-Natal (BE646/17), the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Health\nResearch Ethics Committee (KZ_201807_021), the TB/HIV Information\nSystems Data Request Committee, and the eThekwini Municipality Health\nUnit.\n\nOur study population included all people living with HIV aged 15 years\nor older who were switched to a second-line ART between Dec 1, 2019, and\nNov 30, 2020. We used this baseline period of switching to second-line\ntherapy to allow a minimum follow-up duration of 12 months plus 90 days\nbefore the data cutoff on April 21, 2022. We included only people who\nwere previously receiving standard first-line regimens of TDF/XTC/EFV or\nTDF/XTC/NVP at the time of virological failure (defined as two\nconsecutive viral loads ≥1000 copies per mL at least 56 days apart) and\nwere switched to second-line regimens of AZT/XTC/LPV/r, AZT/XTC/DTG, and\nTDF/XTC/DTG. Thus, we excluded people who were switched to a four-drug\nregimen of AZT/3TC/TDF plus LPV/r or DTG (ie, participants co-infected\nwith hepatitis B) and those switched to abacavir-based second-line\nregimens.\n\n### Procedures\n\nSouth Africa\\'s ART delivery in public health-care clinics involves\nclinical assessment for pregnancy, viral load, CD4 count testing, and\nscreening for tuberculosis at baseline ART initiation and follow-up\nvisits. Based on the South African 2019 ART treatment guidelines, ^4^\nwhich were in use at the time of this study (from Dec 1, 2019, to April\n21, 2022), viral load was routinely taken at 6 and 12 months after ART\ninitiation and every 12 months thereafter, unless viraemia occurred. CD4\ncount was measured at ART initiation and 12 months thereafter and then\nonly repeated if clinically indicated (eg, viral load ≥1000 copies per\nmL). People living with HIV with a viral load of 1000 copies per mL or\nhigher were recommended to receive enhanced adherence counselling and a\nrepeat viral load testing after 2--3 months. For people receiving\nfirst-line regimens containing an NNRTI such as efavirenz \\[EFV\\] or\nnevirapine \\[NVP\\], virological failure was defined as two consecutive\nviral loads of 1000 copies per mL or higher 2--3 months apart. If\nvirological failure occurred, switching to second-line ART was\nrecommended. There was no routine testing for HIV drug resistance at the\ntime of first-line ART virological failure in this setting.\n\n### Data sources and data management\n\nWe used data from South Africa\\'s TIER.Net electronic database, which\ncontains demographics, clinical status, regimen, and clinic visit\ninformation of people receiving ART in public sector health-care\nclinics. ^9^ Data on intermediate outcomes such as the provision of\nadherence counselling and adverse events were unavailable in the\nTIER.Net electronic database and hence could not be analysed in this\nstudy. Data were de-identified by the South African National Department\nof Health\\'s TB/HIV Information Systems before access and analysis by\nthe study team.\n\n### Outcomes and exposures\n\nOur primary outcomes were retention in care and viral suppression at 12\nmonths after starting second-line treatment. Retention in care at 12\nmonths was defined as not being lost to follow-up or recorded in\nTIER.Net as either deceased or transferred out to another clinic (as we\ncould not access or link to data at other clinics to establish retention\nin care) by 365 days after starting second-line treatment. We defined\nloss to follow-up using the South African ART programme guidelines as\nbeing 90 days late for a scheduled visit. ^10^ Viral suppression was\ndefined as viral load lower than 50 copies per mL. We included one\nsecondary outcome for a post-hoc sensitivity analysis defining viral\nsuppression as viral load lower than 1000 copies per mL. Because viral\nloads are not always completed regularly in routine care, we defined the\n12-month window as the closest viral load to 365 days between 181 and\n545 days after starting second-line treatment and included only the\nviral loads of participants retained in care.\n\nThe primary exposure was the second-line ART regimen combination\n(AZT/XTC/DTG or TDF/XTC/DTG or AZT/XTC/LPV/r) that participants were\nswitched to after virological failure. Secondary exposures included\nparticipant baseline characteristics when starting second-line\ntreatment, such as age, gender, active tuberculosis, most recent viral\nload, most recent CD4 count, and time on ART.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nWe summarised participants\\' baseline demographic, clinical\ncharacteristics, and outcomes at 12 months follow-up. We conducted\nunivariable and multivariable modified Poisson regression with robust\nstandard errors adjusting for clustering by clinic ^11^ to determine the\nrisk ratios of retention in care and viral suppression at 12 months\nfollow-up. In the regression analyses, we compared outcomes with the two\nnewer DTG-based regimens (AZT/XTC/DTG and TDF/XTC/DTG) versus outcomes\nwith the previous standard of care (AZT/XTC/LPVr). We also ran these\nmodels comparing the two DTG-based regimens against each other\n(AZT/XTC/DTG *vs* TDF/XTC/DTG). We calculated risk ratios and risk\ndifferences for the primary outcomes from these models. In the\nmultivariable regression models, we adjusted for participant\ncharacteristics at baseline, namely age category, gender, active\ntuberculosis disease, and category for recent viral load. We excluded\nthe most recent CD4 count, time on ART, and the baseline time period of\nswitching to second-line treatment in the multivariable models, as\nincluding these variables resulted in out-of-bound predicted\nprobabilities greater than one. ^12^ Instead, we conducted sensitivity\nanalyses of the effect of the ART regimen on each outcome, adjusted for\nonly CD4 count, time on ART, and the baseline time-period of second-line\nswitch, to demonstrate evidence of minimal confounding of the\nassociation between ART regimen and the primary outcomes by these\nvariables. We conducted further sensitivity analyses excluding\nparticipants who changed their originally prescribed second-line regimen\nwithin 12 months after starting second-line treatment.\n\nAll exposure variables were complete except for the recent CD4 count at\nthe time of switching to second-line treatment, which was missing for\n163 participants. We did not impute missing CD4 counts as they might not\nbe missing at random (as people who are more immunocompromised with low\nCD4 counts might be more likely to have CD4 counts taken). Instead, we\ncreated a missing category in the CD4 variable and included them in the\nanalysis. We did all statistical analyses using R (version 4.2.0).\n\n### Role of the funding source\n\nThe funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection,\ndata analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.\n\n\n\n## Results\n\nFrom Dec 1, 2019, to Nov 30, 2020, 1672 people were recorded as\nswitching to second-line ART after virological failure while receiving\nfirst-line ART at the study clinics ( figure ). We excluded 302\nparticipants who were not previously receiving standard first-line\nregimens of TDF/XTC/EFV or TDF/XTC/NVP at the time of virological\nfailure and 156 who were not switched to standard second-line regimens\nof AZT/XTC/LPV/r or AZT/XTC/DTG or TDF/XTC/DTG. Of the remaining 1214\nparticipants included in this analysis, 689 (57%) were switched to\nAZT/XTC/LPV/r, 217 (18%) to AZT/XTC/DTG, and 308 (25%) to TDF/XTC/DTG\nsecond-line regimens.\n\nFigure\n\nFlow diagram of participants receiving care at 59 clinics in South\nAfrica\n\nART=antiretroviral treatment. AZT=zidovudine. DTG=dolutegravir.\nEFV=efavirenz. LPV/r=ritonavir-boosted lopinavir. NVP=nevirapine.\nTDF=tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. XTC=emtricitabine or lamivudine.\n\nOverall, the median age was 36 years (IQR 30--42), 729 (60%) were\nfemale, and 485 (40%) were male ( table 1 ). Almost all participants\npreviously received first-line TDF/XTC/EFV (n=1198, 99%). Age was\nsimilar between the three regimen groups, but there were more women in\nthe AZT/XTC/LPV/r group (n=460, 67%) than in the AZT/XTC/DTG (n=108,\n50%) and TDF/XTC/DTG (n=161, 52%) groups. The TDF/XTC/DTG group had more\nparticipants (n=155, 50%) with recent viral load at baseline lower than\n10 000 copies per mL than the AZT/XTC/DTG (n=80, 37%) and AZT/XTC/LPV/r\n(n=260, 38%) groups. Time from the most recent viral load to second-line\nswitch was a median of 50 days (IQR 28--95) in the AZT/XTC/LPV/r group,\n49 days (28--102) in the AZT/XTC/DTG group, and 34 days (0--79) in the\nTDF/XTC/DTG group. A higher proportion of participants in the\nAZT/XTC/LPV/r (n=264, 38%) and AZT/XTC/DTG (n=94, 43%) groups had the\nmost recent CD4 count of 200 cells per μL or less, compared with the\nTDF/XTC/DTG group (n=79, 26%).\n\n\nDuring follow-up, 121 participants (10%) changed their originally\nprescribed second-line regimen after a median of 158 days (IQR 84--234;\ntable 2 ). These regimen changes could be due to the ongoing transition\nto DTG-based second-line or to adverse reactions to originally\nprescribed regimens. By 12 months, 941 (78%) of 1214 were retained in\ncare, 80 (7%) had transferred out to another clinic, 16 (1%) were known\nto have died, and 177 (15%) were lost to follow-up. The proportion of\npatients retained in care at 12 months was 75% (n=518) in participants\nreceiving AZT/XTC/LPV/r, 86% (n=186) in those receiving AZT/XTC/DTG, and\n77% (n=237) in those receiving TDF/XTC/DTG ( table 3 ). After adjusting\nfor potential confounders, retention in care at 12 months was more\nlikely in participants receiving AZT/XTC/DTG than in those receiving\nAZT/XTC/LPV/r (adjusted risk ratio \\[aRR\\]=1·14, 95% CI 1·03--1·27,\np=0·012; adjusted risk difference \\[aRD\\]=10·89%, 95% CI 2·01 to 19·78,\np=0·016). Retention in care at 12 months did not differ between\nparticipants receiving TDF/XTC/DTG and those receiving AZT/XTC/LPV/r\n(aRR=1·01, 0·94--1·10, p=0·73; aRD=1·04%, --5·03 to 7·12, p=0·74).\nRetention in care was less likely in participants receiving TDF/XTC/DTG\nthan AZT/XTC/DTG, although evidence for a difference was weak (aRR=0·89,\n0·78--1·01, p=0·060; aRD=--9·85%, --20·33 to 0·63, p=0·066).\n\nOf 941 participants who were retained in care at 12 months, 799 (85%)\nhad a viral load done at a median of 357 days (IQR 293--418; table 2 ).\nOf participants with a viral load test at 12 months, viral suppression\n(\\<50 copies per mL) was higher in those receiving AZT/XTC/DTG (n=89,\n59%) and TDF/XTC/DTG (n=122, 61%) than AZT/XTC/LPV/r (n=209, 47%). Viral\nsuppression at 12 months was more likely in participants receiving\nAZT/XTC/DTG (aRR=1·25, 1·06--1·47, p=0·0093; aRD=11·57%, 2·37 to 20·76,\np=0·014) and in participants receiving TDF/XTC/DTG (aRR=1·30,\n1·14--1·48, p\\<0·0001; aRD=14·16%, 7·14 to 21·18, p\\<0·0001) than in\nparticipants receiving AZT/XTC/LPV/r ( table 4 ). Viral suppression at\n12 months was similar between participants receiving TDF/XCT/DTG and\nthose receiving AZT/XTC/DTG (aRR=1·04, 0·88--1·24, p=0·62; aRD=2·59%,\n--7·78 to 12·60, p=0·62). In a post-hoc sensitivity analysis presented\nas part of the supplementary results, viral suppression (defined as\n\\<1000 copies per mL) at 12 months was more likely in participants\nreceiving AZT/XTC/DTG (86%, aRR=1·19, 1·07--1·32, p=0·0013; aRD=13·22%,\n5·02 to 21·41, p=0·0016) and in participants receiving TDF/XTC/DTG (78%,\naRR=1·11, 1·01--1·22, p=0·033; aRD=7·63%, 0·50 to 14·77, p=0·036) than\nin participants receiving AZT/XTC/LPV/r (69%; appendix 2 p 2 ). Viral\nsuppression (\\<1000 copies per mL) at 12 months was similar between\nparticipants receiving TDF/XCT/DTG and those receiving AZT/XTC/DTG\n(aRR=0·93, 0·85--1·02, p=0·14; aRD=--5·58%, --13·12 to 1·95, p=0·15).\n\nAppendix 2 (pp 3--5) shows minimal confounding of retention in care and\nviral suppression outcomes by recent baseline CD4 count, time on ART,\nand baseline period of second-line switch. Results show that the\noutcomes of retention in care and viral suppression were consistent with\nthe primary analysis after excluding participants who changed their\noriginally prescribed second-line regimens within 12 months after\nstarting second-line treatment ( appendix 2 pp 6--8 ).\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this retrospective cohort study with routine data from 59 ART clinics\nin South Africa, we found that second-line DTG-based regimens\n(AZT/XTC/DTG and TDF/XTC/DTG) were associated with similar or better\nretention in care and better viral suppression than the previously\nrecommended second-line AZT/XTC/LPV/r regimen.\n\nWe evaluated retention in care at 12 months because drug tolerability is\nknown to affect adherence ^13^ and retention in care. ^14^ We saw higher\nretention in care with AZT/XTC/DTG than with AZT/XTC/LPV/r, consistent\nwith the favourable safety profile of DTG-based compared with\nprotease-inhibitor-based regimens for second-line treatment shown in the\nDAWNING ^5^ and NADIA ^15^ trials and generally reported during\nfirst-line ART. ^16^ ^,^ ^17^ ^,^ ^18^ Observed retention in care was\nlower with TDF/XTC/DTG (77%) than with AZT/XTC/DTG (86%), although in\nthe multivariable analysis the evidence for a difference between the two\nregimens was weak (aRD=--9·85%, p=0·066). We expected similar rates\nbetween the two regimens as TDF is slightly more tolerable than AZT.\n^19^ ^,^ ^20^ This observed difference could be a result of unmeasured\nconfounding. For example, people who received TDF/XTC/DTG after\nvirological failure might have been put on this regimen in error as part\nof the transition to first-line DTG or were more likely to have anaemia\n(a contraindication to AZT ^4^ ), which is not recorded in TIER.net.\nThey might, therefore, differ from those receiving AZT/XTC/DTG (eg, they\nmight not have received enhanced adherence counselling or those with\nanaemia might be less clinically well), which could explain the lower\nretention in care seen in this group. Hence, we caution against\ninterpreting our results to indicate superior retention with AZT than\nTDF during second-line ART. The NADIA trial showed low rates of adverse\nevents leading to second-line treatment discontinuation in the TDF-based\n(n=2, 1·0%) and the AZT-based (n=3, 1·0%) groups. ^15^\n\nThe DAWNING trial ^5^ is the only clinical trial directly comparing the\nefficacy of DTG versus LPV/r for second-line ART. The trial enrolled 624\npeople living with HIV aged 18 years or older with virological failure\nduring first-line treatment, who were randomly assigned to receive DTG\n(n=312) or LPV/r (n=312) second-line regimens plus two NRTIs, with at\nleast one being fully active based on results from HIV drug-resistance\ntesting. More participants reported high scores for medication adherence\nin the DTG-based group than in the LPV/r group (67% *vs* 56%), and fewer\nparticipants reported treatment-related adverse events in the DTG-based\ngroup than in the LPV/r group (16% *vs* 38%). ^5^ There were also fewer\nadverse events leading to treatment discontinuation in the DTG group\n(3%) than in the LPV/r group (6%), which might explain the improved\nretention in care that we noted with AZT/XTC/DTG versus AZT/XTC/LPV/r.\n^5^ In the primary intention-to-treat analysis of the DAWNING trial,\nviral suppression (viral load \\<50 copies per mL) at 48 weeks was higher\nin the DTG group (84%) than in the LPV/r group (70%; aRD=13·8%; 95% CI\n7·3--20·3), which is consistent with our findings. ^5^\n\nWe found four clinical trials assessing the efficacy of recycling TDF in\na second-line regimen. The NADIA trial used a 2 × 2 factorial design to\nrandomise people living with HIV who had virological failure during\nfirst-line treatment to receive either second-line DTG or second-line\nlopinavir-boosted darunavir with either TDF or AZT. ^6^ Recycling TDF\nfor second-line treatment was non-inferior to switching to zidovudine\nfor viral suppression (viral load \\<400 copies per mL) at 48 weeks. ^6^\nConsistent with results from the NADIA trial, we found no difference\nbetween TDF/XTC/DTG and AZT/XTC/DTG for viral suppression at less than\n50 copies per mL at 48 weeks. ^6^ The smaller single-arm ARTIST trial\ndone in 62 participants showed 74% of participants had viral suppression\n(\\<50 copies per mL) at 48 weeks with TDF/XTC/DTG during second-line\ntreatment. ^21^ Preliminary results from the VISEND ^22^ and D2EFT ^23^\ntrials also showed TDF/XTC/DTG as being non-inferior to LPV/r or\natazanavir in the VISEND trial and darunavir in the D2EFT trial. In this\nroutine-care setting of our study, TDF/XTC/DTG was associated with\nbetter viral suppression than AZT/XTC/LPV/r.\n\nViral suppression rates in these trials are generally higher than the\nrates we found in routine care, probably because of better treatment\nadherence and monitoring among participants in clinical trials. ^24^ But\ndifferences in cohort baseline virological failure and post-baseline\nviral suppression thresholds might also be responsible for the different\noutcomes. Although the DAWNING ^5^ trial used a viral suppression of\nless than 50 copies per mL, it included participants with a baseline\nviral load between 400 copies per mL and less than 1000 copies per mL,\nwhich is different to the guideline-defined threshold of 1000 copies per\nmL or higher used in our cohort. The NADIA ^6^ trial used a baseline\nviral load of 1000 copies per mL or higher, as we did, but viral\nsuppression was defined at less than 400 copies per mL. The VISEND ^22^\ntrial included participants with a baseline viral load of 1000 copies\nper mL or higher and used a viral suppression threshold of less than\n1000 copies per mL. The resulting viral suppression of less than 1000\ncopies per mL at 12 months (82% with TDF/XTC/DTG and 76% with AZT/3TC\nplus LPV/r or atazanavir/r) ^22^ in the VISEND trial was similar to what\nwe noted in our post-hoc sensitivity analysis with the same thresholds\n(78% with TDF/XTC/DTG, 69% with AZT/XTC/LPV/r, and 86% with\nAZT/XTC/DTG).\n\nAlthough clinical trials have assessed the use of second-line DTG\nregimens after virological failure with first-line NNRTI-based regimens,\nto the best of our knowledge, this is the first cohort study among\npeople living with HIV in a routine-care setting, where factors such as\noutcomes, clinical management, and participants probably differ from\nclinical trials. We used guideline-defined virological failure, viral\nsuppression, and retention in care and adjusted for the effects of\nbaseline characteristics when switching to second-line treatment. Our\nfindings support WHO\\'s recommendation of DTG for second-line ART in\nadults with treatment failure on first-line NNRTI-based regimens.\nAlthough the rollout of first-line DTG progresses well, a substantial\nproportion of people remain on non-DTG-based second-line ART. ^25^\nFurthermore, while the 2023 WHO HIV policy adoption and implementation\nupdate confirms that DTG is currently available in second-line regimens\nin 89 (77%) of 116 LMICs, only 47 (41%) countries have it as the main or\npreferred option, ^26^ which might explain why a significant number of\npeople remain on non-DTG-based second-line regimens. Our findings are\nrelevant as they provide further impetus for promoting changes to\nnational guidelines in these settings to accelerate the transition from\nLPV/r to DTG-based second-line regimens, which is likely to require\nseveral years. Our findings highlight the performance of DTG for\nsecond-line ART in routine care and implementation bottlenecks. Overall,\n12-month outcomes with all second-line regimens were poorer in this\nstudy than in clinical trials. Of the 1214 people in the cohort, about a\nthird (n=420, 35%) achieved programmatic retention in care and viral\nsuppression (\\<50 copies per mL) at 12 months, with 379 (47%) of 799\npeople retained in care still having viraemia on second-line treatment.\nHigh levels of ongoing viraemia on these second-line regimens could lead\nto the emergence of mutations responsible for DTG resistance. ^15^ ^,^\n^27^ Outcomes were also poorer in younger people and those with higher\nbaseline viral load, indicating that early viraemia during second-line\nART is probably due to ongoing poor adherence rather than resistance.\nThis finding highlights the need to improve interventions such as\nadherence counselling in the HIV care cascade during second-line\ntreatment, to better support medication adherence, as regimen choice is\nonly one factor for improving HIV treatment outcomes. Dedicated\nadherence clinics or community ART delivery programmes ^28^ and other\nevidence-based adherence support strategies, particularly among younger\npeople and those at higher risk of poor outcomes, could improve outcomes\nduring second-line treatment.\n\nFurthermore, WHO recommends the substitution of TDF, a common drug in\nmost first-line regimens in LMICs, with AZT when switching to\nsecond-line treatment to ensure having an active NRTI backbone because\nof limited resistance testing for selecting appropriate NRTIs. ^1^ ^,^\n^4^ However, based on results from the NADIA trial suggesting\nnon-inferiority of recycling TDF instead of switching to AZT and the\navailability of TLD as a fixed dose combination, TDF/XTC/DTG is\nconsidered an easily implementable regimen in most LMICs. ^7^ Our\nfindings have provided further assurance regarding these assertions with\nevidence from routine care. This finding is, therefore, also relevant to\nother resource-limited settings where resistance testing is not\nroutinely done to guide the selection of NRTIs for second-line\ntreatment.\n\nThe absence of resistance testing in our cohort means we could not\nclassify virological failures on the basis of drug-resistance mutations\nor ongoing poor adherence. Likewise, we could not determine the effect\nof pre-switch resistance on outcomes, but a substudy of the EARNEST\ntrial ^29^ showed that pre-switch NRTI resistance was rather associated\nwith viral suppression after switching to protease-inhibitor-based\nsecond-line ART. In subanalyses of the DAWNING ^27^ and NADIA ^15^\ntrials, there were a few cases of emergent resistance among people\nreceiving DTG second-line, but none in those receiving\nprotease-inhibitor-based regimes such as LPV/r second-line, which means\nthat among the significant proportion of people who did not suppress in\nour study, the likelihood of DTG-resistance might be higher in the DTG\ngroups than in the protease-inhibitor group.\n\nOur analysis had some potential limitations. First, we used data from\nonly one district in South Africa, which might limit the\ngeneralisability of the findings. Our sample size was similar to\nclinical trials but might not be large enough to detect smaller effect\nsizes. Second, we only assessed 12-month outcomes, and evaluating\nlonger-term follow-up will be important in future analyses. Third, in a\nnew era of DTG, clinicians and nurses might have selected specific\npeople living with HIV for DTG treatment who were more likely to have\nbetter outcomes, which might explain why a higher proportion of\nparticipants receiving TDF/XTC/DTG in our study had a baseline viral\nload lower than 10 000 copies per mL. We therefore adjusted for baseline\nviral load and other relevant baseline characteristics, but we cannot\nrule out potential unmeasured confounders. Fourth, we were unable to\ninclude the recent CD4 count, time on ART, and the baseline period of\nswitch to second-line treatment in the multivariable analyses as it led\nto overfitted models with predicted probabilities exceeding one.\nTherefore, we evaluated the impact of baseline CD4 count, years on ART,\nand the baseline period of switch to second-line treatment in\nsupplementary analyses, which showed minimal evidence of confounding of\nthe association between DTG use and the primary outcomes. Finally, the\nbaseline period of our study partly coincided with the COVID-19\npandemic, which might have disrupted access to HIV care. However, our\nresults showed that the observed primary outcomes were similar across\nthe baseline period categories with minimal evidence of confounding.\n\nDespite these limitations, our findings provide reassurance that in\nroutine-care settings, DTG can be used successfully in second-line\nregimens in a resource-limited setting such as South Africa. Further\nimpetus is required to ensure the availability of DTG in second-line\nregimens in LMICs, both for people who are failing first-line\nNNRTI-based regimens and for people on second-line LPVr-based regimens\nwho could also benefit from being transitioned to DTG.\n\n\n## Data sharing\n\nWe cannot publicly share the data used for this analysis because of the\nlegal and ethical requirements regarding the use of routinely collected\nclinical data in South Africa.

Eligible adults were enrolled between Jan 17 and May 11, 2019, at Ndunde and Milepa health centres, and between March 8 and May 11, 2019, at the Boma clinic. Viral load at the start of the TLD regimen was assessed retrospectively and measured at month 3, 6, and 12, and additionally at month 18 for those ever viraemic (viral load ≥50 copies per mL). Dolutegravir minimal plasma concentrations (Cmin) were determined for individuals with viraemia. Drug-resistance testing was done at the start of TLD regimen and at viral failure (viral load ≥50 copies per mL, followed by viral load ≥500 copies per mL; resistance defined as Stanford score ≥15).\nFindings: Of 1892 participants who transitioned to the TLD regimen, 101 (5·3%) were viraemic at TLD start. 89 of 101 had drug-resistance testing with 31 participants (34·8%) with Lys65Arg mutation, 48 (53·9%) with Met184Val/Ile, and 42 (40·4%) with lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumerate dual resistance. At month 12 (in the per-protocol population), 1725 (97·9% [95% CI 97·1–98·5]) of 1762 had viral loads of less than 50 copies per mL, including 83 (88·3% [80·0–94·0]) of 94 of those who were viraemic at baseline. At month 18, 35 (97·2% [85·5–99·9]) of 36 who were viraemic at TLD start with lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate resistance and 27 (81·8% [64·5–93·0]) of 33 of those viraemic at baseline without resistance had viral load suppression. 14 of 1838 with at least two viral load tests upon transitioning had viral failure (all with at least one dolutegravir Cmin value <640 ng/mL; active threshold), suggesting suboptimal adherence. High baseline viral load was associated with viral failure.\nRationale: The paper focuses on drug-resistance testing and viral load monitoring in patient samples but does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility assays.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 20029816\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: To examine the efficacy of these drugs in Cameroon, where diverse non-B HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant viruses predominate, the reverse transcriptase (RT) viral sequences in patient plasma were analyzed for the presence of mutations that confer drug resistance. Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon.\nRationale: The paper doest not mention in vitro drug susceptibility data or phenotypic data. It mentions clinical isolates and sequencing of plasma samples.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 37167996\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: Methods\nIn this multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial, we enrolled pregnant women aged 18 years or older with confirmed HIV-1 infection at 14–28 weeks of gestation. Women were enrolled at 22 clinical research sites in nine countries (Botswana, Brazil, India, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, USA, and Zimbabwe). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three oral regimens: dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate; dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; or efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Up to 14 days of the antepartum ART before enrolment was permitted. Women with known multiple gestation, fetal anomalies, acute significant illness, creatinine more than 2·5 times the upper limit of normal, or estimated creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL/min were excluded. Primary safety analyses were pairwise comparisons between ART regimens of the proportion of maternal and infant adverse events of grade 3 or higher up to 50 weeks post partum. Secondary efficacy analyses at 50 weeks post partum included comparison of the proportion of women with plasma HIV-1 RNA of less than 200 copies per mL in the combined dolutegravir-containing groups versus the efavirenz-containing group. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned participants with available data. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03048422.\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing. It focuses on clinical outcomes and genotypic resistance testing rather than in vitro susceptibility assays.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 31611857\nQuestion ID: 12\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\nEvidence: The viral load around the time of these visits was <40–75 copies (HIV-RNA) per ml. We included six HIV-1 subtype-B positive individuals on prolonged ART (\\> 15 years) from the SCOPE cohort in the study; 2 who initiated therapy during acute/early HIV infection (\\<6 months of infection before initiation of ART, AHI group) and 4 who initiated therapy during chronic HIV infection (\\>1 year of infection before initiation of ART, CHI group) ( Supplementary Table 1 ).\nRationale: The paper mentions that the participants had viral loads of <40-75 copies (HIV-RNA) per ml during  the study period, indicating effective viral suppression and not virological failure.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 38141637\nQuestion ID: 5\nQuestion: How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?\nEvidence: DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD are multicentre, double-blind, randomised, active comparator-controlled, phase 3 trials of first-line antiretroviral treatment in adults with HIV-1. Eligible participants (aged ≥18 years) were naive to antiretroviral therapy, had plasma HIV-1 RNA 1000 copies per mL or more at screening, had no known resistance to any of the trial drugs, and had creatinine clearance 50 mL per min or more. Of 1494 participants treated in the double-blind phase (1261 [84%] male and 233 [16%] female), 550 continued doravirine and 502 switched to doravirine in the extension. Using the FDA snapshot approach, HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL was maintained in 457 (83%) of 550 participants who continued doravirine and 404 (80%) of 502 participants who switched to doravirine. Protocol-defined virological failure and development of resistance were low, occurring mainly before week 96.\nRationale: The paper mentioned including 1494 participants, the eligibale paricipants had no know resistance to any of the trail drugs, and protocol definition includes virological failure and resistance. This means 1494 inviduals had samples obtained.\nAnswer: 1494"}

Diagnostic tests were positive for\ntuberculosis and HIV. The viral load was 437,927 cp/mL (Log = 5.64).\nAntiretroviral therapy was initiated with Tenofovir/Lamivudine and\nDolutegravir (TDF/3TC and DTG), the latter at a dose of 50 mg/day, as\nwas a regimen for tuberculosis. After 8 months, therapeutic failure was\nverified. Genotyping was requested, with detection of the *H51Y* and\n*E157Q* mutations in the integrase.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAttention when determining the antiretroviral therapy treatment regimen\nof HIV/TB coinfected patients is paramount. Poor adherence to\nantiretroviral therapy and follow-up may have contributed to treatment\nfailure and resistance.\n\n\n## Case report\n\nA 29-year-old male patient was admitted with a right cervical mass\nassociated with fever, dry cough, hyporexia, and myalgia for more than 2\nweeks, as well as neurological symptoms of headache and sudden\nhemiparesis. A chest examination revealed bilateral crepitations,\nrhonchi, and wheezes. No other findings were noted during the physical\nexamination. Cervical ultrasonography detected a large tumoral mass with\nipsilateral adenomegaly. Computed tomography of the chest showed\nfindings consistent with miliary TB or histoplasmosis. The MTB-RIF\n(GeneXpert ^®^ Cepheid) and the rapid test for HIV were both positive.\nThe baseline viral load (VL) was 437,927 cp/mL (Log = 5.64). A\ntherapeutic regimen for TB (Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, and\nEthambutol), ART (TDF/3TC/DTG), the latter at a conventional dose of 50\nmg/day, and empirical therapy against histoplasmosis were initiated. A\nreduction of the cervical lesion and control of the neurological and\nsystemic symptoms were observed, and the patient was discharged for\nfurther outpatient follow-up. In the next year, he returned to the\noutpatient clinic having used ART for 7 months, in addition to treatment\nfor TB and histoplasmosis, reporting vomiting, nausea, hyporexia, and\nparesthesias, with a VL = 12,182 cp/mL (Log = 4.08). He had poor\nadherence to ART and did not fulfill all prescriptions. He also failed\nto attend medical appointments and had challenging clinical follow-up.\nART was switched to TDF/3TC/EFZ, and genotyping was requested, which\nrevealed *H51Y* and *E157Q* mutations, which are associated with\nresistance to INIs, including DTG, and *K70E* and *M184V* mutations in\nthe reverse transcriptase genes. The patient was then treated with a\nrescue regimen of TDF/3TC/DRV600 mg/RTV100 mg, reaching a VL less than\n40 cp/mL, 6 months later.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nMutations following the use of first-line regimens with DTG, an\nantiretroviral drug with a high genetic barrier to resistance, are rare\nand clinically challenging to manage. The leading mutations related to\nthe use of DTG were *R263K* and *G118R* , with *H51Y* and *E157Q*\ngenerally representing secondary mutations. ^1^ The addition of the\n*H51Y* mutation has been shown to cause a further drop-in viral fitness\nbelow that conferred by *R263K* alone. ^2^ *E157Q* represents a rare\nmutation found in approximately 2.4% of untreated patients. ^3^ In a\ncase report, a patient with an isolated *E157Q* mutation presented\nfailure to a regimen using and, subsequently, DTG. ^4^ In Brazil, TB-HIV\ncoinfection is extremely prevalent. Rifampicin, which consists of a\nrifamycin with fundamental bactericidal action for the treatment of TB,\ninteracts with DTG by inducing the liver enzymes *UGT1A1* and *CYP3A* ,\nthus reducing the plasma concentrations of this drug. ^5^ The use of\nDTG, without adjustment, as well as protease inhibitor/ritonavir (PI/r)\nwith rifampicin, may pose risks to the virological control of these\npatients, including the possibility of viral resistance.\n\nOn the other hand, a recent clinical trial comparing once-daily DTG with\nTB treatment rather than twice-daily DTG in the same situation has\nseemed effective in patients with TB-HIV coinfection. ^6^ The Rifampicin\nand Dolutegravir Investigation of Novel Treatment dosing in Tuberculosis\n(RADIANT-TB) was a double-blind study and enrolled 108 individuals\ndisposed as once-daily DTG ( *n* = 55) and twice-daily DTG ( *n* = 53).\nNo resistance was identified after 19 months related to INI. His\nfindings suggested that twice-daily dolutegravir might be unnecessary in\npeople with HIV-associated tuberculosis. ^6^\n\nIn the present case report, the pharmacokinetic interaction between\nrifampicin and DTG, which was used at a low dose (50 mg/day), may have\ncontributed to subinhibitory tissue levels and the emergence of\nresistance mutations. Another important aspect was the patient's poor\nadherence and absence of correct follow-up, which could have also\ncontributed to the emergence of INI mutations in this case. Close\nattention must be paid regarding the antiretroviral treatment of\npatients coinfected with TB to avoid dosage inadequacies that could\nimpair the therapeutic response. Despite the absence of mutations\nidentified in single-dose DTG clinical trials, ^6^ this case report may\nemphasize the importance of continued vigilance for mutations in TB-HIV\ncoinfected patients receiving single-dose DTG.\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDocumented cases of emergent INI resistance mutations against first-line\nDTG are rare. Drug interactions, as well as poor adherence and absence\nof follow-up, may contribute to the emergence of INI mutations. More\nstudies are necessary to understand the safety and efficacy of\nonce-daily DTG in patients undergoing rifampicin treatment for\ntuberculosis.\n\n\n**Data availability:** Information regarding this case is available upon\nrequest.\n\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\n**Funding:** The author(s) received no financial support for the\nresearch, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 36578581\nQuestion ID: 12\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\nEvidence: \"In 8 (4.6%) of the 174 patients with INSTI resistance, DTG was the only INSTI used in the treatment regimen.

A similar case from South Africa has been described, of a treatment experienced patient who developed resistance to DTG after taking DTG 50 mg once a day with rifampicin, instead of the recommended twice daily dosing. Rifampicin is an inducer of the UGT1A1 and CYP3A4 pathways by which DTG is metabolised, resulting in reduced serum DTG concentrations.

This study undertakes a retrospective analysis of the\nepidemiological and clinical features of 195 HIV-positive cases in\nMeizhou, China, from May 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Western blotting\n(WB) confirmed and assessed these cases. Notably, the majority of cases\nemanated from socio-economic groups with comparatively lower levels of\neducation, with 80% being male. Strikingly, 90% of the cases were found\nto be in the middle to late stages of infection based on CD4+ T cell\ncounts. Among the 30 different serum antibody profiles examined,\nreactivity with seven bands (p24, p31, gp41, p51, p66, gp120, and gp160)\nemerged as the most commonly observed WB pattern. The absence of\nspecific bands, specifically p55 (17.44%), p39 (32.31%), and p17\n(25.64%) were most frequent, with the detection frequency of p17 bands\nsignificantly reduced among cases in the AIDS and middle stages. An\nanalysis of drug resistance genotypes indicated that, despite viral\nmutations conferring resistance to certain reverse transcriptase\ninhibitors, the first-line treatment regimen remained effective for\npatients in Meizhou. Notably, mutations resistant to protease inhibitors\nwere infrequent (2.7%), suggesting that incorporating protease\ninhibitors into the treatment regimen may enhance therapeutic outcomes\nfor local patients. These findings provide essential insights into the\nspecific epidemiological patterns, serum antibody profiles, and drug\nresistance genotypes of HIV-infected patients in Meizhou. Significantly,\nthis research contributes to the formulation of future treatment\nstrategies tailored to the local context.\n\n\n\n\n## 2. Materials and methods\n\n### 2.1. Study population and screening\n\nA total of 186257 serum samples from suspected patients, collected\nbetween May 2008 and December 2019, were obtained from Meizhou People's\nHospital. These samples underwent preliminary screening for HIV\npositivity, followed by confirmation through WB. This study was\nperformed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of\nHelsinki and approved by the Human Ethics Committees of Meizhou People's\nHospital and communicated through letter no. 2020-C-129.\n\n#### 2.1.1. Primary screening for HIV-positive samples\n\nAll samples were screened by using an HIV antibody/antigen enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Wantai Bio-Pharm) and HIV Ag/Ab Combo\nReagent Kit (Abbott Germany Limited Partnership, USA). The protocol was\nperformed according to the manufacturer's instructions. In the ELISA\ntest, 20μL of biotin-conjugate reagent and 100μL of the sample were\nadded to a microwell strip pre-coated with recombinant HIV antigen and\nanti-p24 monoclonal antibody. The ELISA plate was incubated for 60\nminutes at 37°C, followed by five washes. Next, 100 μL enzyme-labeled\nAb/Ag was added for further incubation at 37°C for 30 minutes. After\nfive washes, the substrate was added to the well for 30 minutes to allow\nfor colour development, and the reaction was terminated by adding a stop\nsolution. The optical density value of each well was measured using a\nmicroplate reader at a single wavelength of 450 nm or a dual wavelength\nof 450/630 nm. Chemiluminescence particle immunoassay was used to\nqualitatively detect the HIV p24 antigen and HIV-1/2 antibody (Abbott\ni2000SR, Abbott Laboratories, USA).\n\n#### 2.1.2. Confirmation of HIV-positive samples with western blot test\n\nThe WB test was performed to detect antibodies in serum using an HIV\nBlot 2.2 kit (11039-036, MP Biomedical Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, Singapore),\nfollowing the manufacturer's instructions. Working solutions were\nprepared and placed at the corresponding pipette positions in a TECAN\nautomated immunoblotting instrument. Nitrocellulose membrane strips\ncarrying antigens to HIV-1/2 were soaked in washing buffer at a\ntemperature between 22--28°C for 5 minutes, and then the liquid was\nremoved. Two millilitres of immunoblotting buffer and 20μL of the sample\nwere added to each strip, which was then placed in the TECAN automated\nimmunoblotting instrument for detection. The WB results were interpreted\naccording to the National AIDS Testing Technical Specification (Revised\nEdition 2015) of the China National Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention. The absence of a specific band or the presence of only the\np17 band was considered a negative test result for the sample, while the\npresence of two env bands and one gag (or pol) band was considered a\npositive test result. Samples with insufficient bands on the membrane\nstrip for a conclusive positive verdict were classified as uncertain\nspecimens.\n\n### 2.2. Flow cytometry analysis of CD4 ^+^ and CD8 ^+^ T cells\n\nBlood cells were stained with the leukocyte differentiation antigen\nCD3/CD8/CD45/CD4 detection kit (340499, BD Bioscience, USA). Briefly,\n10μL of fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies were mixed and\nincubated with 25μL of EDTA-K2 anti-coagulated blood for 15 minutes.\nErythrocyte lysis buffer (450μL) was added for another 15 minutes before\nthe samples were analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\n### 2.3. Analysis of drug-resistant genotypes in HIV-positive samples\n\nHIV-infected blood samples were sent to the Guangdong AIDS Prevention\nCenter for genotypic resistance testing. In brief, cDNA containing the\nprotease-reverse transcriptase (PR-RT) sequence of HIV-1 was amplified\nand subjected to high-throughput sequencing. Sequences were submitted to\nthe Stanford University HIV resistance database (\nhttp://hivdb.stanford.EDU ) for subtype identification, resistance loci,\nand drug sensitivity analysis.\n\n### 2.4. Statistical analysis\n\nData were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences\n(SPSS) software, version 21.0. The student's t-test was used to\ncalculate *p* values, with statistical significance set at *p* \\< 0.05.\n\n\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. HIV screening of serum samples in the Meizhou region\n\nOf the 186,257 samples screened, 210 (0.11%) were positive using ELISA,\nand 291 (1.94%) were positive using chemiluminescence immunoassay\n(CLIA). To eliminate false-positive results in preliminary screening,\n281 preliminary positive samples underwent further validation through\nwestern blotting, with 195 samples confirmed as positive (positive ratio\n= 69.40%). Among the 195 HIV-infected individuals, 157 (80.51%) were\nmale, and 38 (19.49%) were female ( **Table 1** ). Regarding age\ndistribution, 1 (0.51%) was diagnosed between 0 and 18 years, 32\n(16.41%) between 19 and 30 years, 55 (28.21%) between 31 and 45 years,\n54 (27.69%) between 46-60 years, 48 (24.62%) between 61 and 80 years,\nand 5 (2.56%) were over 80 years of age ( **Table 1** ). The youngest\npatient was 18 years old, and the oldest was 85. Of the HIV-infected\ncases, 151 cases (77.44%) were permanent residents of Meizhou, and 44\ncases (19.49%) came from other areas ( **Table 1** ). Students and\ngovernment personnel accounted for 5.13% (10 cases), farmers and workers\nfor 76.92% (150 cases), and others for 17.95% (35 cases) ( **Table 1**\n). The distribution of the 195 confirmed samples is presented monthly\nbased on the sampling period ( **Figure 1** ). A comparison of cases\nfrom May to December (5--12) in 2018 and 2019 showed a higher number of\nHIV-infected individuals in 2019. An analysis of monthly cases revealed\nthe highest incidence of HIV diagnoses in July of each year. The CD4 ^+^\nT cell numbers were further determined for 155 HIV- positive samples,\nfollowing which the cases were classified into different clinical stages\n( Liu et al., 2020 ): the primary infection stage (15 cases, 9.7%), the\nmiddle stage of infection (63 cases, 40.6%), and AIDS stage (77 cases,\n49.7%) ( **Supplementary Table S1** ). There was a significant\ndifference in the CD4 ^+^ T lymphocyte values at different clinical\nstages ( *p* \\< 0.01). The statistical results show that the majority of\nHIV-infected patients in Meizhou were in the middle of the AIDS stages\nof infection.\n\n### 3.2. Characteristics of Western blot profiles in HIV infection\n\nWB results of the 195 HIV-1 positive samples were analyzed and\nclassified into 30 types of patterns ( **Table 2** ). Reactivity with\nseven bands (p24, p31, gp41, p51, p66, gp120, and gp160) was the most\ncommonly observed WB pattern, with a proportion of 28.21% (55/195),\nwhile the complete 10-band pattern occurred in only 9.74% (19/195) of\nthe samples. Of the 195 samples, 133 were full band or sub-full band\n(over 7 bands) patterns, accounting for 67.99%. The percentage\ndistribution of the specific bands in the investigated samples is\npresented in **Figure 2** . The three envelope protein bands (gp160,\ngp120, and gp41) were the most prevalent, with ratios of 100%, 100%, and\n96.92%, respectively, followed by p66 (92.82%) and p24 (91.79%). In\ncontrast, p55 (17.44%), p39 (32.31%), and p17 (25.64%) were the most\nfrequently missing bands ( **Figure 2** ). The detection rates of p55\nand p39 were low in each clinical stage, while the p17 bands that were\nsignificantly lower in cases at the middle stages and AIDS stages of the\ninfection ( **Table 3** ).\n\n### 3.3. Drug resistance and genomics\n\nHIV-1 genetic mutation and drug resistance are major barriers to\nsuccessful antiretroviral therapy. To elucidate the HIV-1 genotype drug\nresistance characteristics in HIV-infected people of Meizhou, serum\nsamples from 37 untreated patients \\[29 men (78%); 8 women (22%)\\]\nobtained from Meizhou People's Hospital were included. The average age\nof the patients was 44 years (ranging from 7 to 80 years). The patients\nwere infected through various routes: heterosexual transmission (75.68%,\n28/37), homosexual transmission (8.11%, 3/37), mother-to-child\ntransmission (2.70%, 1/37), and unclear transmission (13.51%, 5/37). The\nmost prevalent HIV-1 subtype was circulating recombinant form CRF01_AE\n(64.86%, 24/37), followed by CRF07-BC (10.81%, 4/37), B+CRF01-AE (5.40%,\n2/37), CRF55-01B (5.40%, 2/37), B+C (5.4%, 2/37), A (2.70%, 1/37), B\n(2.70%, 1/37), and C (2.70%, 1/37). The initial antiviral treatment\nregimen consisted of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors\n(NRTIs) plus efavirenz (EFV)/nevirapine (NVP) in 31 cases (83.79%) or\nzidovudine (AZT)/lamivudine (3TC) plus EFV in 6 cases (16.21%). Pro-RT\ngene sequences from the samples were obtained and analyzed for drug\nresistance-related mutations. Among the 37 PCR-positive cases, 23\ncarried one or more drug-resistance mutations. The drug resistance\nmutations included 10 mutations for NRTIs, with M184V/I (15 cases) as\nthe main mutation site, 11 mutations for non-nucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), with K103KN (12 cases) as the main\nmutation site, and four resistant mutations for protease inhibitors\n(PIs) ( **Table 4** ). The RT inhibitor resistance rate was 62.16%\n(23/37) compared to 2.7% (1/37) for PIs, indicating that RT inhibitor\nresistance is the prevalent mutation in Meizhou. Moreover,\ncross-resistance between NRTIs and NNRTIs co-occurred in patients,\naccounting for 40.54% of drug-resistant mutations. Based on the\nmutations carried by each HIV-infected individual, their sensitivity to\nanti-HIV drugs used in clinical practice was further assessed (\n**Supplementary Table S2** ).\n\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nIn this study, serum samples collected from the HIV Confirmatory\nLaboratory of Meizhou People's Hospital Medical Laboratory Center (From\nMay 2008 to December 2019) were analyzed. Primary HIV screening by ELISA\nor CLIA revealed HIV-positive rates of 0.11% and 1.94%, respectively.\nELISA and CLIA are simple and high-throughput; however, they are\nassociated with relatively high false-positive outcomes ( Liu and Jiang,\n2004 ; Chen, 2012 ; Wu et al., 2018 ). More rigorous strategies, such as\nwestern blotting, are needed for verification. Herein, 195 samples were\nconfirmed as HIV-1 positive by western blotting, with no HIV-2 positive\nsamples being observed. Most HIV-1 infected patients were determined to\nbe in the middle and AIDS stages of the infection ( **Supplementary\nTable S1** ), and there were more men than women patients ( **Table 1**\n). The HIV-1 infected patients are mainly farmers and migrant workers (\n**Table 1** ), whose education level is generally low, and who may have\nless knowledge about AIDS prevention. It is particularly important to\nfurther enhance the coverage of AIDS prevention knowledge in the rural\npopulation. The highest detection rate of HIV-infected was in July (\n**Figure 1** ); nonetheless, the reason behind this observation remains\nto be further investigated. A contemporaneous comparison of\nHIV-diagnosed cases in 2018 and 2019 suggested an increasing trend in\nMeizhou ( **Figure 1** ). Therefore, HIV prevention and control in the\nMeizhou community cannot be relaxed. It is necessary to further improve\nthe coverage of HIV screening to achieve early detection and treatment.\nWB is the gold standard for confirming HIV infection and provides\ninformation on virus and host responses. The full WB pattern contains 10\nbands that are specific to HIV-1. However, the band patterns of WB vary\naccording to stages of the infection, prevalent viral strains, and\ncohorts, thus displaying significant regional characteristics. In this\nstudy, we observed 30 types of WB patterns from the 195 HIV-positive\nsamples ( **Table 2** ). Reactivity with seven bands (p24, p31, gp41,\np51, p66, gp120, and gp160) was the most commonly observed pattern with\na proportion of 28.21%, while the complete 10-band pattern occurred in\nonly 9.74% of the samples, which was different from other studies that\nreported the full pattern as the main outcome ( Sudha et al., 2006 ).\nEnvelope protein bands (gp160, gp120, and gp41), pol protein (p66), and\ngag protein (p24) were the most prevalent, which was consistent with the\nprevious studies ( Zhong et al., 2012 ; Xie and Chen, 2018 ). p55, p39,\nand p17 were the most frequently missing bands ( **Figure 2** ). The\nfrequencies of p55 and p39 bands were low in samples from every\ninfection stage ( **Table 3** ), but the p17 bands were only\nsignificantly lower in cases at the AIDS and middle stages of the\ninfection ( **Table 3** ). These results indicated that lack of antibody\nreactivity to p17 was associated with disease progression. HAART is the\nmost effective clinical treatment for AIDS ( Sattwika et al., 2023 ). In\nMeizhou, TDF/AZT +3TC+EFV/NVP is the most commonly adopted initial\ntreatment regimen, with the EFV+AZT/3TC regimen being less prescribed.\nBased on the drug-resistant genotype assay results, the main resistant\nHIV-1 strains in Meizhou were the CRF01-AE subtype, followed by the\nCRF07-BC subtype, which is consistent with the current situation in\nChina ( Huo et al., 2019 ).\n\nIn Meizhou, the resistance mutation of NNRTIs is the most prevalent,\nfollowed by that of NRTIs. Moreover, the cross-resistance of NRTIs and\nNNRTIs co-occurred in patients and accounted for 40.54% of\ndrug-resistant mutations, indicating that multidrug resistance is\nwidespread in the region. This may be related to the long-term use of\nfirst-line therapeutic drugs, resulting in the continuous accumulation\nof cross-drug-resistant mutant HIV-1 strains ( Ma et al., 2010 ).\nStudies have shown that the accumulation of thymidine analogue-resistant\nmutations causes almost all NRTI resistance ( Zha and Zha, 2006 ). In\nthe resistance mutations of NRTIs, the M184V mutation was most\nprevalent, followed by K65R ( **Table 4** ). It has been reported that\nthe M184V mutation causes significant resistance to 3TC but increases\nthe sensitivity to TDF and AZT ( Zuo, 2020 ). The K65R mutation was\nreported to produce moderate or high resistance to TDF and ABC ( Guo,\n2014 ). In this study, we observed that some patients simultaneously\nharboured mutations at the K65R and M184V sites; however, treatment with\nAZT was still appropriate, indicating that the first-line treatment\nregimen was efficacious for patients in Meizhou with this drug-resistant\nform of the disease. These results may explain why the HIV antiviral\ntreatment failure ratio due to resistant mutations in Meizhou (8.95%)\nwas much lower than the global data (40.30%--84.00%) ( Shen and Su, 2019\n). Compared with the high incidence of drug-resistant mutations in NRTIs\nand NNRTIs, resistant mutations in PIs were only found in one out of the\n37 cases ( **Table 4** ). These results suggest that patients in Meizhou\nwith drug-resistant HIV/AIDS may still be sensitive to PIs since\nresistance mutations rarely occur in response to this group of drugs.\nTherefore, when patients develop cross-resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs\nsimultaneously and the first-line treatment regimen ceases to be\nefficacious, second-line treatment may be adopted. The study of clinical\nand epidemiological characteristics of HIV patients is conducive to the\nestablishment of regional HIV transmission and epidemic identification\nstandards and early warning systems. At the same time, the correlation\nbetween serological characteristics and clinical drug resistance was\nanalyzed to provide useful information for clinical timely acquisition\nof HIV biological information and prediction of drug resistance (\nShchemelev et al., 2023 ). The analysis model of the correlation between\nserotype and drug resistance may provide new ideas for HIV epidemic\nprevention and identification analysis. By studying the laboratory\ndiagnosis and monitoring indicators and drug resistance of HIV infected\npeople in Meizhou city, we provide scientific clinical basis for AIDS\nprevention and treatment. Although the detection methods of HIV\ninfection are becoming more and more mature and diversified, there are\nstill some problems that need to be studied and solved. One of the\nprominent problems is the long incubation period of HIV-infected people\nand the different window periods of HIV detection methods. We combine\nthe characteristics of the regional HIV epidemic in the detection\npopulation and adopt appropriate detection methods to reduce the missed\ndetection rate of HIV-infected people. In the process of antiretroviral\ndrug treatment, clinical laboratory detection of drug resistance genes\nappears in various problems, we need to further explore, such as how\nlong the interval of drug resistance monitoring detection is\nappropriate, can timely understand the characteristics of HIV antiviral\nresistance, is conducive to HIV infected people to develop effective\ntreatment plans.\n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nIn summary, we explored the characteristics of clinical HIV infection in\nMeizhou, China, by retrospectively analyzing samples from HIV-infected\npeople obtained from May 2008 to December 2019. Most of the 195 positive\ncases were found to be male and, in the middle, and AIDS stages. They\nwere mainly from groups with relatively lower education levels. We found\nthat the most prevalent pattern was reactivity with seven bands (p24,\np31, gp41, p51, p66, gp120, and gp160), instead of the full-band pattern\nreported in other regions. The WB bands including p55, p39, and p17 were\nthe most frequently missing bands. We further observed decreased\ndetection of the p17 antibody in patients in the middle to the AIDS\nstage of the infection/disease. Most resistant mutations were related to\nNRTIs and NNRTIs; only one case carried a mutation resistant to PIs,\nsuggesting the presence of protease inhibitors in the treatment regimen\nwill work better in local patients. Our data described the specific\nepidemiological patterns, serum antibody profiles and drug resistance\ngenotypes of HIV-infected patients in Meizhou, and are of great\nsignificance for guiding local treatment strategies in the future.\n\n\n\n## Data availability statement\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the\narticle/ **Supplementary Material** .

Recombination may affect prevention efforts and interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-1 infection. Here, we characterized the epidemiology of HIV-1 CRFs and URFs in Israel. Partial pol sequences from treatment naïve patients diagnosed in 2010–2018 were assessed using the recombinant identification program (RIP), the recombinant detection program (RDP5), and using the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic method, using 410 reference sequences obtained from the Los Alamos database. CRFs and URFs were identified in 11% (213/1940) of all sequenced cases. The median age at diagnosis was 38 (30–47) years, 61% originated from Israel, and 82% were male. The most common were CRF02_AG (30.5%), CRF01_AE (16.9%), and the more complex forms CRF01_AE/CRF02_AG/A3 (10.8%) and B/F1 (7%). A significant increase in their overall proportion was observed in recent years (8.1% in 2010–2012, 20.3% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). This increase was most prominent in individuals carrying CRF02_AG (2.5% in 2010–2015, 9.8% in 2016–2018, p < 0.001). Men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most common risk group; however, those infected with the secondary recombinant CRF02_AG/A6 were mainly injecting drug users (IDUs). The most common resistance mutations were K103N (5/213, 2.3%) and E138A (18/213, 8.5%) in the reverse transcriptase. Only E138A was more frequent in the recombinants compared with the classic subtypes and was significantly associated with a specific secondary CRF, CRF02_AG/A4. We concluded that CRFs and URFs were mainly detected in Israeli-born MSM and that an increase in the overall proportion of such HIV-1 sequences could be observed in more recent years.\"\nRationale: The paper does not mention any in vitro drug susceptibility testing. It focuses on the analysis of HIV-1 sequences and the identification of recombinant forms and drug resistance mutations.\nAnswer: No\n\nPMID: 25956162\nQuestion ID: 12\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\nEvidence: Analysis of two cases of virological failure during raltegravir-based therapy showed that the accumulation and the rapid evolution of primary INSTI resistance-associated mutations coincided with the S119R mutation. To further assess the clinical significance of these results in the context of S119R and the INSTI resistance-associated mutations, we analyzed two cases of clinical and virological failure during RAL-based therapy using the clinical histories and the deep sequencing-based HIV-1 genotyping results of two individuals ( Fig. 3 ).\nRationale: The paper describes two cases of virological failure during raltegravir-based therapy, indicating that sequences were obtained from individuals experiencing virological failure.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 36016383\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"Abstract: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be transmitted via parenteral, sexual, or vertical exposure routes. The number of HIV-1 cases detected yearly in children and adolescents in Brazil did not decrease over the last decade, representing ~5% of total cases described in the country. In recent years, the HIV-1 diversity and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) are moving toward a marked increase. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the TDRM prevalence in 135 treatment-naïve HIV-1 vertically infected children and adolescents born in between 1993 and 2012. These children were assessed in either 2001–2007 or 2008–2012 when they were 0 to 17 years old. The individuals assessed in 2001–2007 (n = 38) had median CD4+ T cell counts of 1218 cells/mm3 (IQR: 738–2.084) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.18 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 3.88–4.08). The individuals (n = 97) evaluated in 2008–2012 showed median CD4+ T cell counts of 898.5 cells/mm3 (IQR: 591.3–1.821) and median HIV-1 plasma viral load of 4.69 log10 copies/mL (IQR: 4.26–5.33). A steady decrease in the median CD4 T+ cell counts was observed with age progression, as expected. The majority HIV-1 pol sequences (87%) were classified as pure HIV-1 subtypes (77% subtype B, 9% subtype F1 and 1.5% subtype C), while 13% of sequences were classified as recombinants (CRF45_cpx, n = 4; CRF28/29_BF1, n = 2; CRF02_AG, n = 1; CRF40_BF1, n = 1, CRF99_BF1, n = 1, URF_BF1, n = 8). The overall prevalence of TDRM was 14% (19/135), conferring resistance to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, 13/135–9.6%), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI, 8/135–5.9%), and protease inhibitors (PI, 2/135–1.5%). The main TDRM observed for NNRTI was the K103N (n = 8), while the mutations T215I/Y/D/E (n = 7) and M184V (n = 4) were the main TDRM for NRTI. Only two TDRM were observed for PI in one individual each (M46I and V82A). Most TDRM were found in the HIV-1 subtype B (84%) sequences. This study reveals an HIV-1 epidemic with high diversity and moderate prevalence of TDRM in the pediatric population of Rio de Janeiro, indicating the existence of possible problems in the clinical management of prophylactic therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission and future treatment options for the affected children.\"\nRationale: The paper doesn't provide experimental results on how effective different drugs are against HIV-1 strains isolated from the studied children and adolescents. Instead, it focuses on analyzing the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in treatment-naïve individuals.

The mean age of the participants was calculated to be 32.21 yr and over half of the patients (n=16) were male and the mean time of HARRT use was 47.69 months.  Standard first-line regimen in Iran is comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI);  drug resistance mutations for the 3 classes of ART (NNRTI, NRTI, and PI) were observed and 4 samples showed resistance to all of them.\nRationale: The paper mentions the patients got standard treatment, and the evidence indicates the presence of mutations associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, suggesting that individuals in the study had received these drug classes prior to sample sequencing.\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI\n\nPMID: 25694526\nQuestion ID: 6\nQuestion: From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?\nEvidence: \"Molecular epidemiological analysis was applied to data from 289 HIV-1-infected individuals followed at the reference hospital of the province of Minho, Portugal, at which isolated viruses had been sequenced between 2000 and 2012.

To elucidate INSTI resistance mechanisms, we propagated HIV-1\nin the presence of escalating concentrations of the INSTI dolutegravir.\nHIV-1 became resistant to dolutegravir by sequentially acquiring\nmutations in the envelope glycoprotein (Env) and the nucleocapsid\nprotein. The selected Env mutations enhance the ability of the virus to\nspread via cell-cell transfer, thereby increasing the multiplicity of\ninfection (MOI). While the selected Env mutations confer broad\nresistance to multiple classes of antiretrovirals, the fold resistance\nis \\~2 logs higher for INSTIs than for other classes of drugs. We\ndemonstrate that INSTIs are more readily overwhelmed by high MOI than\nother classes of antiretrovirals. Our findings advance the understanding\nof how HIV-1 can evolve resistance to antiretrovirals, including the\npotent INSTIs, in the absence of drug-target gene mutations.\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### HIV-1 acquires multiple mutations in the Env- and NC-coding regions during long-term propagation in DTG\n\nTo investigate how HIV-1 develops high-level resistance to INSTIs, we\ninfected the SupT1 T cell line with the HIV-1 NL4-3 clone ( *47* ) and\nserially propagated the virus in the presence of increasing\nconcentrations of DTG ( Fig. 1A ). The passaging experiment was\ninitiated at 0.1 nM DTG, which is less than the median inhibitory\nconcentration (IC ~50~ ) for wild-type (WT) NL4-3 in the context of\nspreading infection ( *46* ). After nearly 1 year of continuous\npassaging, we were able to increase the DTG concentration to 4.0 μM,\nwhich is \\>1000-fold the IC ~50~ . To identify the genetic changes in\nthe viral genome responsible for DTG resistance, we extracted genomic\nDNA from the infected cells at a number of time points and performed\nsequencing analysis of *gag* , *pol* , *env* , and *vpu* . At passage 7\n(8.0 nM DTG), we did not identify any mutations in these regions.\nHowever, upon continued propagation in 8.0 nM DTG (passage 19), we\nidentified an Env-K6N mutation in the signal peptide (SP) and the\nEnv-A541V mutation (HXB2 numbering) in gp41 HR1. We previously reported\nthat the Env-A541V mutation confers an \\~8-fold resistance to DTG in\nmulticycle spreading infection ( *45* , *46* ). After the emergence of\nEnv-A541V, we could gradually increase the DTG concentration. At passage\n23 (32 nM DTG), an additional Env mutation (Env-R298K in the gp120 V3\nregion) was acquired and two NC mutations (NC-N17S and G19S) were\ndetected. Later, we identified two additional Env mutations (Env-S162K\nin the gp120 V2 region and Env-Q363R in the gp120 C3 region) and two IN\nmutations (IN-D229E and IN-R224Q). These IN mutations are not reported\nas INSTI resistance mutations in the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance\nDatabase ( *48* ). We determined that these IN mutations do not confer\nmeasurable resistance to DTG (fig. S1A). At passage 46 (2000 nM DTG), we\nidentified the IN-R263K DTG resistance mutation at low frequency.\nConsistent with a previous report ( *49* ), IN-R263K conferred\nsignificant levels of resistance to DTG (fig. S1A). This analysis\nindicates that HIV-1 ~NL4-3~ sequentially acquires mutations in Env-,\nNC-, and IN-coding regions ( Fig. 1A ) during propagation in the SupT1 T\ncell line in the presence of escalating concentrations of DTG.\n\nFig. 1.\n\n**In vitro selection of drug-resistant variants.**\n\nLong-term passaging of ( **A** ) WT NL4-3 (culture 1), ( **B** ) WT\nCH185 (culture 1), and ( **C** ) CH185 Env-T541I (culture 2) in the\npresence of the INSTI DTG. ( **D** ) Long-term passaging of WT NL4-3\n(culture 1) in the presence of the NRTTI EFdA. SupT1 \\[(A) and (D)\\] or\nSupT1huR5 \\[(B) and (C)\\] T cell lines were infected with the indicated\nviruses to initiate the passaging experiments. At the time points\nindicated by the arrows, genomic DNA was extracted from the drug-treated\ncultures, and the Gag-, Pol-, and Env-coding regions were sequenced.\nMutations detected at frequencies greater than 25% in the bulk\nsequencing are shown. Mutations highlighted in bold are established\nresistance mutations to DTG (A) or EFdA (D).\n\nTo verify these results, we performed repeated passaging experiments\nwith WT NL4-3 in the presence of DTG (denoted as culture 2 and culture 3\nin fig. S2). We also initiated long-term propagation experiments with\nthe NL4-3 Env-A541V mutant, as this mutant is frequently detected early\nin selection experiments ( Fig. 1A and fig. S2, C and D) ( *45* , *46*\n). We again identified multiple Env and NC mutations, but no resistance\nmutations in IN, in the presence of \\>1000 nM DTG. All of the NL4-3\ncultures selected the Env-A541V mutation and Env mutations that disrupt\nN-linked glycosylation in the gp120 V1/V2 region (fig. S2, C and D).\n\nThe NL4-3 strain used in the experiments described above is a\nlaboratory-adapted, subtype B, CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolate. To extend our\ninvestigation to CCR5-tropic and primary HIV-1 isolates, we performed\nmultiple DTG selection experiments with the subtype C, transmitted\nfounder, CCR5-tropic isolate CH185 ( Fig. 1B and fig. S2) ( *50* ) and\nthe subtype B, CCR5-tropic NL(AD8) clone (fig. S2) ( *51* ). Selections\nwere performed in the SupT1huR5 T cell line, which expresses CCR5 ( *52*\n). As observed in the passaging experiments using the NL4-3 isolate,\nboth CH185 and NL(AD8) strains sequentially acquired mutations in Env-,\nNC-, and IN-coding regions. Despite the long-term passaging of NL(AD8)\nand CH185 in the presence of 500 to 20,000 nM DTG, we did not identify\nany reported INSTI resistance mutations in the IN-coding region ( Fig.\n1, B and C , and fig. S2B). NC-G19S was identified in all the viral\nstrains tested, suggesting that mutations in the NC domain may\ncontribute to INSTI resistance ( Fig. 1, A and B , and fig. S2A). As\nshown in fig. S2E, the HIV-1 variants that we tested in this study\nfrequently selected mutations in the outer domain of gp120 and at the\ngp120-gp41 interface. Mutations at amino acid positions Env-525,\nEnv-541, Env-547, Env-558, and Env-561 (HXB2 numbering) in the\ngp120-gp41 interface were identified in multiple viral strains. We\npreviously reported that mutations at Env-541 and Env-558 reduce\nsensitivity to DTG ( *45* , *46* ). We also detected multiple mutations\nin the matrix (MA)-, capsid (CA)-, and RT-coding regions, but these\nmutations did not confer resistance (fig. S2, A and B). Overall, these\ndata indicate that NC and Env mutations, rather than INSTI resistance\nmutations in IN, are predominantly selected independent of subtype and\nco-receptor usage upon HIV-1 propagation in the presence of DTG.\n\nNext, we examined whether an INSTI-resistant IN mutant acquires NC and\nEnv mutations during long-term passaging in the presence of high\nconcentrations of DTG. The IN-G118R mutation is often seen in\nindividuals experiencing virological failure on DTG-containing regimens\n( *49* ). We propagated this mutant in the SupT1 T cell line at a\nstarting concentration of 0.1 nM DTG and, over the course of nearly 1\nyear, escalated the DTG concentration to 2000 nM. The IN-G118R mutation\nwas stable over the course of the selection experiment. The IN mutant\nfirst acquired multiple Env mutations, followed by two NC mutations\n(NC-N8S and M46I) (fig. S2A). The first Env mutation acquired was\nEnv-A541V, which we previously reported can rescue defects imposed by\ndrug resistance mutations ( *45* ). Env-A541V rescued replication\ndefects imposed by IN-G118R and provided a replication advantage over WT\nin the presence of DTG (fig. S3). Together, these results suggest that\nmutations in NC, IN, and Env may cooperatively contribute to INSTI\nresistance in spreading infection.\n\n### HIV-1 more rapidly acquires resistance mutations in the drug-target gene in the presence of an RT inhibitor compared to the INSTI DTG\n\nThe data presented above indicate that HIV-1 predominantly acquires\nmutations in the Env- and NC-coding regions when propagated in the\npresence of the INSTI DTG. To investigate whether HIV-1 acquires\nmutations in these coding regions in the presence of another class of\nARV, we propagated WT NL4-3 in the presence of increasing concentrations\nof the nucleoside RT translocation inhibitor (NRTTI), islatravir\n\\[4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine (EFdA)\\] ( Fig. 1D ). We chose\nEFdA because it is highly potent and active against HIV-1 strains\nresistant to existing NRTIs ( *53* , *54* ). In contrast to our results\nwith DTG, NL4-3 rapidly acquired a target-gene (RT) mutation in the\npresence of a low concentration of EFdA ( Fig. 1D ); at passage 8 (1.0\nnM EFdA), the virus acquired the RT-M184I mutation, a primary RT\nmutation that confers modest levels of resistance to EFdA (fig. S1B) (\n*53* , *54* ). The virus also acquired Env-A336T at this time point. At\na later time point (passage 30, 64 nM EFdA), the virus additionally\nacquired multiple Env mutations along with two accessory RT mutations\n(RT-A114S and G335S) ( Fig. 1D and figs. S1B and S2). Two of the\nselected Env mutations (Env-T77I and N97D) are located at the gp120-gp41\ninterface, which we previously reported as the site of mutations that\ncan rescue replication-defective mutants and confer broad ARV resistance\n( *45* , *46* ). In another culture of NL4-3 in the SupT1 T cell line,\nthe RT-T165A mutation emerged after RT-M184I along with Env-S162R (fig.\nS2). The RT substitutions at residues 114 and 165 are accessory\nmutations that increase resistance to EFdA when coupled with RT-M184I/V\n(fig. S1B) ( *53* , *54* ). No NC mutations were identified in any of\nthe EFdA selection experiments ( Fig. 1D and fig. S2A), suggesting that\nthe emergence of NC mutations is specific to viral escape from INSTIs.\nThese results demonstrate that, consistent with a large number of\nprevious studies ( *3* , *53* , *54* ), HIV-1 can rapidly develop\nresistance to RT inhibitors by acquiring resistance mutations in RT. In\ncontrast, we find that escape from INSTIs can be driven by mutations\noutside the drug-target gene (IN), specifically in Env and NC.\n\n### Accumulation of multiple Env mutations leads to high-level resistance to DTG\n\nThe passaging experiments presented in Fig. 1 and fig. S2 indicate the\nacquisition of high-level resistance to DTG. On the basis of our\nprevious work with single Env mutations ( *45* , *46* ), we hypothesized\nthat the multiple Env mutations we identified are primarily responsible\nfor the high-level DTG resistance achieved in our selection experiments.\nTo test this hypothesis, we constructed an infectious NL4-3 molecular\nclone containing the heavily mutated Env derived from NL4-3 culture 1 in\nthe presence of 256 nM DTG ( Figs. 1A and ​ and2A). 2A ). The 7XEnv\\*\nclone contains seven Env mutations (V85A, S162K, R298K, and Q363R in\ngp120, and A541V, V693I, and G825E in gp41) and a mutation in the\nVpu/Env-SP--coding region (Vpu-V60L/Env-SP-K6N, denoted by \\*). We\nexamined the replication kinetics of this mutant in the presence or\nabsence of a range of DTG concentrations (0.03 to 3000 nM) by\ntransfecting SupT1 T cells with the WT NL4-3 and 7XEnv\\* molecular\nclones and monitoring virus replication by RT assay. Our previously\nreported Env-A541V mutant ( *45* , *46* ) was included as a control (\nFig. 2B ). Consistent with our previous analyses ( *45* , *46* ),\nEnv-A541V exhibited faster-than-WT replication kinetics in the absence\nof DTG and a replication advantage over WT in the presence of 3.0 nM DTG\n( Fig. 2B ). 7XEnv\\* exhibited similar replication kinetics as Env-A541V\nin the absence of DTG but displayed a replication advantage over both WT\nand Env-A541V in the presence of 3.0 nM DTG. Whereas replication of both\nWT and Env-A541V was blocked by 100 nM DTG, 7XEnv\\* could replicate in\nthe presence of 100 and 1000 nM DTG. To determine whether the viruses\nacquired additional mutations in the presence of high concentrations of\nDTG, we performed sequencing analysis of the viruses at the peak of\nreplication. We did not identify any changes in *gag* , *pol* , *env* ,\nor *nef* compared to the starting viruses.\n\nFig. 2.\n\n**The NL4-3 7XEnv\\* variant exhibits high-level DTG resistance in the\ncontext of spreading, multi-round infection but not in cell-free,\nsingle-round infection.**\n\n( **A** ) An infectious molecular clone with seven Env mutations (7XEnv)\nand a Vpu mutation (denoted by the \\*) derived from the long-term\npassaging experiment was constructed by transferring the *env* amplicon\nfrom NL4-3 culture 1 (passage 38, 256 nM DTG; Fig. 1A ) into pNL4-3. The\nlocations of mutations in Env are indicated: C1 and C3, first and third\nconserved domains of gp120, respectively; V2 and V3, second and third\nvariable domains of gp120, respectively; HR1, heptad repeat 1 of gp41;\nMSD, membrane-spanning domain; CT, cytoplasmic tail. ( **B** )\nReplication kinetics of the NL4-3 Env variants in the SupT1 T cell line\nin the absence or presence of DTG. Replication curves obtained in the\npresence of 0, 3, 100, and 1000 nM DTG are shown. Data are\nrepresentative of at least three independent experiments. ( **C** ) Fold\nchanges in IC ~50~ were calculated compared to that for the WT over a\nrange of DTG concentrations (0.01 to 3000 nM). IC ~50~ values were\ncalculated on the basis of the AUC of the replication kinetics.

( **F** ) Cell-cell fusion\nactivity of the NL4-3 Env variants. The transfected HEK293T cells were\ncocultured with TZM-bl cells in the presence of a cocktail of RPV and\nDTG to prevent productive infection of the TZM-bl cells. Data from at\nleast three independent experiments are shown as means ± SEM. \\* *P* \\<\n0.05, unpaired *t* test.\n\nBy calculating DTG IC ~50~ based on the area under the curve (AUC) of\nthe replication kinetics in the presence of 0.3 to 3000 nM DTG, we\ndetermined that 7XEnv\\* exhibited \\>2000-fold resistance to DTG ( Fig.\n2C ). As reported previously ( *45* , *46* ), A541V exhibited modest\n(\\~6-fold) resistance. These data indicate that accumulation of multiple\nEnv mutations leads to high-level resistance to DTG. To examine the\nimpact of the Vpu/Env-SP mutation in 7XEnv\\* on DTG sensitivity in a\nspreading infection, we also prepared the heavily mutated Env clone\ncontaining WT Vpu/Env-SP (denoted 7XEnv) (fig. S4). The Vpu/Env-SP\nmutation had only a subtle effect on the phenotype of 7XEnv\\* in\nspreading infection, indicating that the seven Env mutations present in\n7XEnv play the dominant role in conferring high-level INSTI resistance.\n\nPrevious studies reported that, under certain conditions, unintegrated\nviral DNA can express viral proteins ( *55* ), leading to DTG resistance\n( *14* , *16* ). To examine whether integration is required for the\nhigh-level DTG resistance conferred by the Env mutations, we examined\nthe replication of a catalytically inactive IN-D116N mutant ( *56* ) in\nthe context of WT or the Env-A541V or 7XEnv\\* mutants in the presence of\nDTG. We found that the IN-D116N--containing mutants did not exhibit any\nmeasurable viral replication in the absence or presence of DTG ( Fig. 2B\n). This finding indicates that unintegrated viral DNA does not\ncontribute to viral replication and DTG resistance in our experiments.\n\nWe previously reported that single Env mutations at the gp120-gp41\ninterface (e.g., Env-P81S and Env-A558T) enhance virus replication\ncapacity and confer ARV resistance in the context of a spreading\ninfection but not in single-cycle infectivity assays ( *45* , *46* ).\nThese mutations promoted cell-cell virus transmission at the cost of\ncell-free viral infectivity and Env-mediated fusogenicity ( *45* , *46*\n). To examine the effect of accumulation of multiple Env mutations on\ninfectivity and drug sensitivity in the context of cell-free viral\ninfection, we measured single-round, cell-free viral infectivity of\nEnv-A541V and 7XEnv\\* in the absence or presence of DTG in the TZM-bl\nindicator cell line ( Fig. 2, D and E ). 7XEnv\\* displayed impaired\ncell-free viral infectivity compared to WT NL4-3 ( Fig. 2D ). The Env\nmutations did not confer resistance to DTG in the context of\nsingle-round, cell-free viral infection ( Fig. 2E ). We also examined\nthe fusogenicity of 7XEnv\\* and Env-A541V using the TZM-bl cell line.\nThe fusogenicity of Env-A541V and 7XEnv\\* was significantly impaired\nrelative to WT ( Fig. 2F ). These results indicate that the high-level\nresistance to INSTIs conferred by 7XEnv is not due to enhanced cell-free\nviral infection but rather is likely due to increased cell-cell transfer\ncapacity (see below).\n\n### High-level Env-mediated INSTI resistance is independent of subtype and co-receptor usage\n\nTo examine whether the Env mutations selected in DTG in the context of a\nclinically relevant isolate ( Fig. 1, B and C , and fig. S2, C and D)\nconfer high-level resistance to INSTIs, we constructed infectious\nmolecular clones containing the Env mutations selected in the context of\nthe subtype C transmitted/founder strain CH185 ( Fig. 3A ). H4-14 is\nderived from the CH185 culture 1 in the presence of 4000 nM DTG ( Fig.\n1B ). This clone has two mutations in gp120 (Env-N145D and D322N) and\nfour in gp41 (T541I, S620N, T651I, and Y712C). H3-16 is derived from the\nCH185 Env-T541I culture 2 in the presence of 2000 nM DTG ( Fig. 1C ).\nThis clone has two mutations in gp120 (Env-N197D and A204T) and two in\nthe gp41 ectodomain (Env-A525T and T541I). Both clones harbor the\nEnv-T541I mutation in gp41 and mutations in N-linked glycosylation\nmotifs (Asn-X-Ser/Thr, where X is any amino acid) in the gp120 V1/V2\nregion (Env-N197D in H3-16 and Env-N145D in H4-14).\n\nFig. 3.\n\n**The heavily mutated CH185 Env variants exhibit high-level DTG\nresistance in the context of spreading, multi-round infection but not in\ncell-free, single-round infection.**\n\n( **A** ) Infectious molecular clones with the indicated Env mutations\nin the context of CH185. H3-16 and H4-14 clones were constructed by\ntransferring the *env* amplicons from CH185 culture 1 (passage 27, 1000\nnM DTG; Fig. 1B ) and CH185 Env-T541I culture 2 (passage 29, 800 nM DTG;\nFig. 1C ), respectively, into CH185. V1 and V3, first and third variable\ndomain of gp120, respectively; C2, second conserved domain; HR1 and HR2,\nheptad repeat 1 and 2 of gp41, respectively; FP, fusion peptide; DSL,\ndisulfide loop; CT, cytoplasmic tail. ( **B** ) Replication kinetics of\nthe CH185 Env variants in the SupT1 huR5 T cell line in the absence or\npresence of DTG. Replication curves obtained in the presence of 0, 3,\n100, and 3000 nM DTG are shown. Data are representative of at least\nthree independent experiments. ( **C** ) Fold changes in IC ~50~ were\ncalculated compared to that for the WT, based on the AUC of the\nreplication kinetics. ( **D** ) Single-cycle, cell-free viral\ninfectivity of the Env variants. RT-normalized virus stocks were used to\ninfect TZM-bl cells. Luciferase activity was measured at 48 hours after\ninfection. Relative infectivity is shown, normalized to 1 for WT CH185.\n( **E** ) DTG sensitivity in the context of cell-free infection. TZM-bl\ncells were exposed to 100 TCID ~50~ of WT or the Env mutants in the\npresence of various concentrations of DTG. ( **F** ) Cell-cell fusion\nactivity of the CH185 Env variants. The transfected HEK293T cells were\ncocultured with TZM-bl cells in the presence of a cocktail of RPV and\nDTG to prevent productive infection of the TZM-bl cells. Data from at\nleast three independent experiments are shown as means ± SEM. \\* *P* \\<\n0.05, unpaired *t* test.\n\nAs observed with the NL4-3 7XEnv\\* and 7XEnv ( Fig. 2 and fig. S4), in\nthe absence of DTG, the Env-T541I single mutant and the H3-16 and H4-14\nmultiple mutants exhibit a replication advantage over WT CH185 ( Fig. 3B\n). In the presence of 3 nM DTG, WT replication is blocked and that of\nEnv-T541I is severely suppressed. In contrast, the H3-16 and H4-14\nmutants can still replicate in 3000 nM DTG ( Fig. 3B ). Quantitative\nanalyses over multiple experiments indicate that the H3-16 and H4-16\nmutants exhibit a \\>4000-fold change in DTG IC ~50~ relative to the WT\nin spreading infections ( Fig. 3C ). As seen with the NL4-3--derived\nmutants, the CH185-derived Env mutants display reduced single-round,\ncell-free infectivity ( Fig. 3D ), and DTG sensitivity in the context of\ncell-free viral infection is not affected by the Env mutations ( Fig. 3E\n). The H3-16 and H4-16 mutants also exhibit reduced fusogenicity\nrelative to WT ( Fig. 3F ). These results indicate that the ability of\nmultiple Env mutations to confer high-level DTG resistance in\nmulti-round, spreading infections is independent of subtype and\nco-receptor usage.\n\n### Heavily mutated Env clones that are highly resistant to DTG exhibit broad but modest reductions in sensitivity to other classes of ARVs\n\nWe previously reported that single Env mutations provide a modest\nreplication advantage over WT virus in the presence of multiple classes\nof ARVs in spreading but not cell-free infections ( *45* ), and we show\nabove that Env mutants with multiple Env substitutions exhibit\nhigh-level resistance to DTG. To determine whether 7XEnv\\* is resistant\nto other classes of ARVs, we compared viral replication of WT NL4-3 with\n7XEnv\\* in multi-round, spreading infections in the presence of two\nother INSTIs (RAL and CAB), the NRTI emtricitabine (FTC), NNRTIs\nrilpivirine (RPV) and efavirenz (EFV), NRTTI EFdA, PIs darunavir (DRV)\nand nelfinavir (NFV), fusion inhibitor T-20, attachment inhibitor\n(conformational blocker) BMS-378806 (BMS-806), allosteric IN inhibitor\n(ALLINI) BI-224436 ( *57* ), and CA inhibitor LEN ( Fig. 4 ). We found\nthat 7XEnv\\* exhibits \\>400-fold and \\>2000-fold resistance to RAL and\nCAB, respectively, indicating that the heavily mutated Env confers\nhigh-level resistance to INSTIs other than DTG. 7XEnv\\* also exhibits\nbroad resistance to the RT inhibitors FTC (12-fold), EFdA (13-fold), RPV\n(4.2-fold), EFV (11-fold), the PIs DRV (5.7-fold) and NFV (11-fold), and\nthe capsid inhibitor LEN (3.5-fold). However, the fold resistance of\n7XEnv\\* to these non-INSTI classes of ARVs is markedly lower than for\nthe INSTIs. 7XEnv\\* does not exhibit resistance to the ALLINI BI-224436\ndespite the fact that this compound, like the INSTIs, targets IN (see\nDiscussion).\n\nFig. 4.\n\n**ARV sensitivity of the NL4-3 7XEnv\\* variant in the context of\nspreading infection.**\n\nFold resistance of 7XEnv\\* to multiple classes of ARVs. The SupT1 T cell\nline was transfected with WT NL4-3 or 7XEnv\\* proviral clones in the\nabsence or presence of a range of ARV concentrations. Virus replication\nkinetics were monitored by measuring RT activity. Fold changes in IC\n~50~ relative to WT were calculated. IC ~50~ values were calculated on\nthe basis of the AUC of the replication kinetics. IC ~50~ values were\ncalculated for INSTIs (DTG, RAL, and CAB), NRTI (FTC), NNRTI (EFV and\nRPV), NRTTI (EFdA), PI (DRV and NFV), entry inhibitors (T-20 and\nBMS-806), ALLINI (BI-224436), and CA inhibitor (LEN). Data from at least\ntwo independent experiments are shown as means ± SEM. \\* *P* \\< 0.05,\nunpaired *t* test.\n\n### Heavily mutated Env variants exhibit enhanced cell-cell transfer capacity\n\nAs shown above, the Env mutations selected in high concentrations of DTG\nconfer high-level resistance to INSTIs in the context of spreading but\nnot cell-free viral infection. This result suggests that the\naccumulation of Env mutations overcomes ARV inhibition by enhancing\ncell-cell transfer. To test this hypothesis, we compared cell-cell\ntransfer of WT NL4-3, Env-A541V, and 7XEnv by coculturing\nvirus-producing cells and uninfected target cells ( Fig. 5A ).\nVirus-producing SupT1 T cells were prepared by spinoculation, and target\nSupT1 cells were stained with a cell proliferation dye to distinguish\nthem from producer cells. One day after coculture, cells were stained\nwith fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)--conjugated anti-p24 Ab and\ninfected target cells were enumerated by flow cytometry. As shown in\nFig. 5B , this analysis demonstrated that productive infection of\nEnv-A541V and 7XEnv through cell-cell contact is 1.9- and 3.1-fold more\nefficient than that of WT NL4-3, respectively. To monitor the\ncontribution of cell-free viral infection in the coculture experiments,\nwe also seeded the virus-producing cells in a transwell apparatus that\nprevents cell-cell contact and thus allows only cell-free infection to\noccur. During the 24-hour time frame, the contribution of cell-free\ninfection was negligible ( Fig. 5B ). We also examined the efficiency of\ncell-cell transfer of the CH185 Env mutants under the same conditions.\nSimilar to what we observed with the NL4-3--derived mutants, the CH185\nmutants exhibited significantly enhanced cell-cell transfer, with\nincreases of 1.9-, 7.7-, and 14-fold relative to WT for Env-T541I,\nH3-16, and H4-14, respectively ( Fig. 5C ). Again, the contribution of\ncell-free infection to viral transfer was negligible, as demonstrated by\ntranswell experiments ( Fig. 5C ). Together with the results of Figs. 2D\nand ​ and3D, 3D , these data indicate that the Env mutants selected to be\nresistant to DTG exhibit highly proficient cell-cell transfer capacity\nat the cost of reduced cell-free infectivity.\n\nFig. 5.\n\n**The heavily mutated Env variants exhibit increased cell-cell transfer\ncapacity.**\n\n( **A** ) Experimental design of cell-cell transfer assay.\nVirus-producer SupT1 cells were spinoculated with the indicated viruses\n24 hours before the assay. Target SupT1 cells were labeled with cell\nproliferation dye. Before the coculture, the number of infected donor\ncells was normalized by intracellular p24-FITC signals. The donor and\nthe target SupT1 cells were cocultured at a 1:1 ratio in the absence or\npresence of ARVs. Twenty-four hours after coculture, intracellular p24\nantigen was detected by staining with FITC-conjugated anti-p24 Ab.\nVirus-producing cells were also seeded in a transwell insert to monitor\ncell-free viral infection.

Cell-cell transmission of 7XEnv\nwas nearly completely inhibited by RPV in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig.\n5E ), whereas even the highest concentration of DTG tested did not\ncompletely inhibit productive infection of 7XEnv ( Fig. 5D ). We noted\nthat the inhibitory effect of DTG on viral infection reached a plateau\nat concentrations above 10 nM DTG, indicating that the maximum\ninhibitory effect of DTG is reduced in the context of cell-cell\ntransfer.\n\nTo confirm that the p24 signals in the target cells are from de novo\nviral gene expression after viral DNA integration as opposed to p24\nsignal from incoming virus particles after viral transfer, we also\nperformed coculture experiments using pBR43IeG constructs, which express\nenhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) under control of an internal\nribosome entry site (IRES) after integration ( Fig. 5F ) ( *58* ).\nConsistent with the p24 staining results, the Env mutants produce more\neGFP-expressing cells after coculture compared to WT ( Fig. 5, G to I ).\nThe cells infected with the Env mutants also exhibit a higher eGFP\nsignal intensity compared to WT ( Fig. 5I ), suggesting that the Env\nmutations increase the number of productive infection events per cell.\nTogether, our data suggest that efficient cell-cell transfer conferred\nby the Env mutations results in higher levels of productive infection (a\nhigher MOI), leading to high-level resistance to INSTIs.\n\n### The Env mutations alter the conformational landscape and stability of Env trimers\n\nWe previously reported that Env-A541V reduces the sensitivity of NL4-3\nto NAbs recognizing the CD4-bound gp120 conformation, suggesting that\nthis mutation stabilizes the closed Env conformation ( *45* ). To\nexamine the impact of the accumulated Env mutations on Env conformation,\nwe compared the sensitivity of WT and 7XEnv NL4-3 to NAbs that\npreferentially recognize the CD4-bound conformation ( *21* , *59* ),\nspecifically 17b \\[which binds a CD4-induced (CD4i) epitope\\], 447-52D\n(which binds the V3 loop), and F105 \\[which recognizes the CD4 binding\nsite (CD4bs)\\] ( Fig. 6A ). 7XEnv was significantly more resistant to\n17b, 447-52D, and F105 than WT ( Fig. 6A ) and was less sensitive than\nWT to inhibition by soluble CD4 (sCD4) ( Fig. 6B ). To measure the\neffect of the Env mutations on CD4 and NAb binding, we performed binding\nassays with Env on the surface of 293T cells ( Fig. 6, C to E ).\nRelative to WT, 7XEnv exhibited an increased binding to\nCD4--immunoglobulin (Ig) ( *60* ) but reduced binding to VRC03,\nsuggesting that 7XEnv may sample a relatively open conformation in the\nunliganded state. We hypothesized that 7XEnv does not efficiently\nundergo CD4-induced conformational changes in the Env trimer, leading to\nless binding/neutralization by 17b. To test this hypothesis, we measured\n17b binding in the presence of increasing concentrations of sCD4. We\nfound that sCD4 could not sensitize 17b binding to 7XEnv compared to WT\n( Fig. 6E ), indicating that sCD4 does not efficiently trigger\nconformational changes in the mutant Env trimer.\n\nFig. 6.\n\n**Sensitivity of the heavily mutated Env variants to ligand binding and\nneutralization.**\n\nSensitivity of NL4-3 7XEnv to ( **A** ) NAbs recognizing the CD4-bound\nconformation and ( **B** ) sCD4.

To detect p24 in the\ncells, the transfected cells were fixed and permeabilized and then\nstained with FITC-conjugated anti-p24 Ab. ( **H** ) Cold sensitivity of\nthe CH185 Env mutants. RT-normalized viruses were incubated at 4°C for\nthe indicated times and frozen at −80°C. The viral aliquots were quickly\nthawed, and infectivity was measured using TZM-bl cells. Data from at\nleast three independent experiments are shown as means ± SEM. \\* *P* \\<\n0.05, unpaired *t* test.\n\nSeveral studies have reported that exposure to low temperatures causes\ngradual conformational changes in the Env trimer, leading to loss of\nfunction. Unstable Env trimers prone to open conformation are\ninactivated by exposure to cold ( *21* , *61* ). We therefore examined\nthe cold sensitivity of the 7XEnv mutant as a measure of their\nconformational stability. As shown in Fig. 6F , WT NL4-3 progressively\nlost infectivity after incubation at 4°C, whereas 7XEnv retained \\~50%\ninfectivity after 120 hours of incubation at 4°C.\n\nWe and others previously reported that Env mutations in primary isolates\nhave different impacts on Env conformation and neutralization properties\nrelative to laboratory-adapted strains ( *45* , *62* ). We found that\nmost of the Abs that recognize the CD4-bound conformation could not bind\nand neutralize subtype C CH185 Env. Therefore, we evaluated CD4-Ig\nbinding and cold sensitivity. Similarly to NL4-3 7XEnv, we found that\nthe H3-16 and H4-14 Env variants exhibit higher CD4-Ig binding ( Fig. 6G\n) and are resistant to cold inactivation ( Fig. 6H ) relative to WT.\nThese results suggest that the heavily mutated CH185 Env trimers have\nsimilar structural and functional phenotypes as 7XEnv.\n\nTo examine further the conformational dynamics of 7XEnv, we performed a\nsmFRET analysis of Env on the surface of virus particles ( Fig. 7 )\nusing fluorescent probes in the gp120 V1 and V4 regions ( *20* ). We\nexamined FRET states of unliganded Env, and Env treated with sCD4 or\ndodecameric CD4 (12XCD4) ( *63* ). smFRET analysis has previously shown\nthat the HIV-1 Env trimer can sample at least three distinct\nconformational states: low, intermediate, and high FRET (denoted as\nstates 1, 3, and 2/2A, respectively) ( Fig. 7A ), with state 1\nrepresenting a closed, ground-state configuration ( *19* , *20* , *22*\n). Our analysis indicated that 7XEnv showed increased populations of\nintermediate- and high-FRET intensity in the unliganded state relative\nto WT ( Fig. 7D ), suggesting that 7XEnv more extensively samples\npartially open conformations in the unliganded state compared to WT. As\nreported previously ( *20* , *63* ), treatment with sCD4 or 12XCD4\nshifted the WT conformation to higher-FRET states, whereas 7XEnv\nremained relatively unaffected ( Fig. 7, B and C to F ). These results\nindicate that 7XEnv is relatively insensitive to conformational\nremodeling after interaction with CD4. Together, our biochemical and\nsmFRET analyses demonstrate that the accumulation of Env mutations\nreduces CD4-induced conformational rearrangement of the Env trimer,\nwhich is necessary for viral entry in cell-free infection.\n\nFig. 7.\n\n**7XEnv displays an open conformation that is insensitive to soluble\nCD4.**\n\nHIV-1 NL4-3ΔRT virus particles containing WT ( **A** to **C** ) or 7XEnv\n( **D** to **F** ) were produced, labeled, and analyzed by smFRET. Virus\nparticles were incubated with soluble, monomeric CD4 \\[(B) and (E)\\] or\ndodecameric CD4 \\[(C) and (F)\\] at 100 μg/ml for 60 min before imaging.\nHistograms show the sum of *N* individual FRET trajectories ± SEM.\nFour-state Gaussian curve fitting was performed for each histogram, with\nFRET populations designated as follows: State 1, FRET ≈ 0.1\n(pretriggered, closed conformation); state 2, FRET ≈ 0.6 (necessary,\nintermediate conformation); state 2A, FRET ≈ 0.8 (alternate intermediate\nconformation); state 3, FRET ≈ 0.3 (fully CD4-bound, open conformation).\n\n### The Env mutations stabilize gp120-gp41 interactions\n\nTo gain insights into the mechanism of enhanced cell-cell transfer\nconferred by the accumulation of Env mutations, we incubated purified WT\nNL4-3 and 7XEnv virions with sCD4 at 37°C for 2 hours and then measured\nthe amount of particle-associated gp120 and p24 by Western blotting (\nFig. 8, A and B ). As we previously reported ( *45* ), the levels of\ngp120 associated with WT NL4-3 virus particles decrease in a\ndose-dependent manner as the sCD4 concentration increases. 7XEnv\nexhibits a reduced rate of gp120 shedding relative to WT ( Fig. 8, A and\nB ), indicating a stabilized gp120-gp41 interaction.\n\nFig. 8.\n\n**Effect of Env mutations on sCD4- or eCD4-Ig--induced gp120 shedding.**\n\n( **A** and **B** ) The indicated viruses were incubated with a range of\nsCD4 concentrations at 37°C for 2 hours and purified through a 20%\nsucrose cushion, and viral proteins were detected by Western blotting.\n(A) Representative gel for sCD4-induced gp120 shedding assay.

( **C** and **D** )\nThe indicated viruses were incubated with a range of eCD4-Ig\nconcentrations at 37°C for 2 hours and purified through a 20% sucrose\ncushion, and viral proteins were detected by Western blotting. ( **E** )\nSensitivity of the CH185 Env mutants to eCD4-Ig. TZM-bl cells were\nexposed to 100 TCID ~50~ of viruses in the presence of the indicated\nconcentrations of eCD4-Ig. Luciferase activity was measured at 48 hours\nafter infection. Data in the graphs from three independent experiments\nare shown as means ± SEM. \\* *P* \\< 0.05, unpaired *t* test.\n\nIt is known that Env glycoproteins from primary HIV-1 isolates tend to\nsample more closed Env conformations and are less prone to gp120\nshedding compared to Env from laboratory-adapted strains ( *45* , *64*\n). It has been shown that eCD4-Ig, a fusion of CD4-Ig and a CCR5\ncoreceptor-mimetic peptide, can more potently neutralize viral infection\nand promote the shedding of gp120 of primary HIV-1 isolates relative to\nsCD4 ( *65* ). To examine the rate of gp120 shedding induced by eCD4-Ig,\nwe incubated the CH185 Env variants with eCD4-Ig (0 to 100 μg/ml) at\n37°C for 2 hours ( Fig. 8, C and D ). We found that eCD4-Ig strongly\nreduces the level of gp120 associated with WT CH185 particles in a\ndose-dependent manner. In contrast, the CH185 Env mutants exhibit\nminimal gp120 shedding in the presence of up to eCD4-Ig (100 μg/ml),\nindicating that the Env mutations stabilize the gp120-gp41 interaction.\nThis is analogous to the stabilization of gp120/gp41 interactions seen\nabove with NL4-3 7XEnv ( Fig. 8, A and B ). Despite this lack of gp120\nshedding, eCD4-Ig efficiently neutralized the CH185 variants ( Fig. 8E\n); the heavily mutated Env variants (H3-16 and H4-14) were more\nsensitive to eCD4-Ig--induced neutralization than WT CH185, suggesting\nthat the heavily mutated Env may exhibit higher binding affinity with\neCD4-Ig compared to WT CH185. These results indicate that enhanced\ncell-cell transmission capacity of the selected mutants from genetically\ndistant viral strains (e.g., NL4-3 and CH185) is caused by analogous\nchanges in conformational landscapes and Env trimer stability.\n\n### Mutations in the zinc-finger domains of NC confer modest levels of INSTI resistance\n\nAs demonstrated above, multiple independent passaging experiments using\ndifferent viral strains in the presence of DTG led to the acquisition of\nmutations in NC ( Figs. 1 and 9A and fig. S2A). To examine the impact of\nthe NC mutations on DTG sensitivity, we introduced a panel of NC\nmutations obtained in our selection experiments into NL4-3 and measured\ntheir effect on susceptibility to INSTIs. We found that NC-N17S, G19S,\nG22E, N27I/K, G40E, and G43E mutations within the zinc-finger domains\nconfer modest (three- to fivefold) but statistically significant levels\nof resistance not only to DTG ( Fig. 9B ) but also to other INSTIs, RAL\nand CAB (fig. S5, A and B). With the exception of NC-G40E, the\nsingle-round, cell-free infectivity of the NC mutants is comparable to\nthat of WT ( Fig. 9C ). Although the fold resistance conferred by these\nNC mutations is lower than that conferred by the INSTI resistance\nmutation IN-G118R, INSTI resistance was increased when IN-G118R was\ncoupled with the NC-N8S/M46I mutations, which we identified during\npropagation of IN-G118R in the presence of DTG (Fig. 9B and figs. S2A\nand S5, A and B). These data indicate that NC mutations can\ncooperatively increase INSTI resistance in combination with INSTI\nresistance mutations in IN. NC mutations selected with DTG did not\naffect viral sensitivity to the NRTTI EFdA or NRTI RPV (fig. S5, C and\nD), indicating that the observed resistance is specific to INSTIs.\n\nFig. 9.\n\n**DTG sensitivity of the Gag-NC mutants.**\n\n( **A** ) Sequence of the HIV-1 NC domain. The NC mutations selected in\nthe presence of DTG are highlighted in red (within the zinc-finger\ndomains) or blue (outside the zinc fingers). ( **B** ) Fold change in\nDTG IC ~50~ of the NC mutants relative to WT.

Data from at least three independent experiments are\nshown as means ± SEM. \\* *P* \\< 0.05, one-way analysis of variance\n(ANOVA) and Tukey's multiple-comparison test or unpaired *t* test.\n\n### INSTI-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity can be overcome by high MOI\n\nThe data presented above indicate that heavily mutated Env clones\ndisplay markedly higher resistance to INSTIs than to other classes of\nARVs. This result, together with our observation that Env mutations\nconfer drug resistance by increasing the MOI of the infection through\nenhanced cell-cell transfer capacity, raises the possibility that the\nantiviral activity of INSTIs is more readily overcome by high MOI than\nthe antiviral activity of other classes of ARVs. To directly test this\nhypothesis, we used VSV-G--pseudotyped virus because such particles are\nhighly infectious, making it possible to readily achieve high MOI in\nsingle-round infection ( Fig. 10A ). As expected, the number of eGFP ^+^\ncells increased in proportion to viral input; eGFP median fluorescence\nintensity (MFI) also increased sharply at high MOI, suggesting that the\ninfected cells contain multiple copies of proviral DNA at high viral\ninput ( Fig. 10A ). To compare the impact of high MOI on viral\nsusceptibility to INSTIs versus other classes of ARVs, we titrated viral\ninput of VSV-G--pseudotyped HIV-1 eGFP reporter virus in the absence or\npresence of the INSTIs DTG, RAL, and CAB; the NNRTIs RPV and EFV; the\nNRTI FTC; the NRTTI EFdA; and the PI DRV. In the case of DRV, the drug\nwas used to treat the virus-producing cells, as PIs act at the\nmaturation step of the virus replication cycle. Next, we titrated drug\nconcentrations over a range of viral inputs and measured eGFP expression\nin the absence or presence of drugs. DTG potently inhibited viral\ninfection under low-MOI conditions; however, the efficacy of DTG was\nsubstantially reduced in an MOI-dependent manner ( Fig. 10B ). Under\nthese conditions, infection with virus encoding a catalytically inactive\nIN mutant (IN-D116N) did not result in any eGFP ^+^ cells ( Fig. 10B ),\nindicating that eGFP expression from unintegrated DNA does not\ncontribute to the loss of DTG susceptibility at high viral input.\nSimilar results were obtained with the two other INSTIs, RAL and CAB (\nFig. 10C ). In contrast to the results obtained with INSTIs, the NNRTIs\nRPV and EFV could completely inhibit viral infection independent of MOI\n( Fig. 10, C and D ). Consistent with previous studies ( *33* , *34* ),\nthe NRTI FTC and the NRTTI EFdA exhibited MOI-dependent viral inhibition\n( Fig. 10, E and F ). However, unlike DTG, high concentrations of FTC\nand EFdA could block viral infection under high-MOI conditions. The PI\nDRV blocked infection at all MOIs tested ( Fig. 10G ). We also tested\nthe CA inhibitor LEN and the ALLINI BI-224436. Infection was completely\nblocked by these inhibitors independent of MOI (fig. S6, A and B). These\ndata indicate that INSTIs are more readily overwhelmed by high MOI than\nother classes of ARVs.\n\nFig. 10.\n\n**Impact of MOI on the sensitivity of HIV-1 to ARVs.**\n\n( **A** ) The SupT1 T cell line was exposed to a range of\nVSV-G--pseudotyped eGFP reporter virus inputs in the absence of drugs.\neGFP MFI was markedly increased when SupT1 T cells were exposed to high\ninput of VSV-G--pseudotyped viruses.

The amount of dark virus was 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 times\nthe amount of eGFP reporter virus.

Data from at least three independent\nexperiments are shown as means ± SEM. \\* *P* \\< 0.05, unpaired *t* test.\n\nTo examine further the ability of high viral input to reduce the\nsensitivity of HIV-1 to INSTIs, we performed an abrogation assay by\ncoinfecting the SupT1 T cell line with VSV-G--pseudotyped eGFP reporter\nvirus and VSV-G--pseudotyped HIV-1 lacking a reporter (denoted as \"dark\nvirus\") in the presence of ARVs. The amount of eGFP virus was held\nconstant, while the amount of dark virus was increased ( Fig. 10H ). We\nobserved that as the input of WT dark virus increased, the inhibitory\neffect of DTG on reporter virus infection decreased ( Fig. 10I ). Mutant\ndark viruses harboring catalytically inactive IN (IN-D116N) or RT\n(RT-D186N) mutations, which do not affect GagPol incorporation into the\nvirion ( *56* ), did not affect the inhibitory activity of DTG ( Fig.\n10I ), indicating that reverse transcription and intasome formation are\nrequired for the dark virus to abrogate DTG-mediated inhibition of eGFP\nreporter virus infection. In contrast to the ability of WT dark virus to\novercome DTG inhibition of eGFP reporter virus infection, and consistent\nwith the high-MOI infection data ( Fig. 10D ), the NNRTI RPV was able to\ncompletely block eGFP reporter virus infection even in the presence of a\n10-fold excess of dark virus ( Fig. 10J ). Collectively, the data in\nFig. 10 indicate that the inhibitory activity of INSTIs is more\nvulnerable to high-MOI conditions than that of other classes of ARVs.\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nIn this study, we performed long-term propagation of HIV-1 in the\npresence of the INSTI DTG and the RT inhibitor EFdA. Independent of\nviral strain, in the presence of DTG, HIV-1 sequentially accumulated\nmultiple mutations in Env, the NC domain of Gag, and, on rare occasions,\nthe IN-coding region. In contrast, in the presence of the RT inhibitor\nEFdA, HIV-1 rapidly acquired resistance mutations in RT along with\nseveral mutations in Env. We found that the accumulation of Env\nmutations leads to broad resistance to multiple classes of ARVs.\nNotably, however, the fold resistance conferred by the heavily mutated\nEnvs is markedly higher for INSTIs than for other classes of ARVs and is\nassociated with highly efficient cell-cell transfer.\n\nTo gain insights into the mechanism by which the heavily mutated Envs\nselected at high concentrations of DTG enhance cell-cell transfer\ncapacity, we analyzed the impact of the Env mutations on Env function\nand conformation. We found that 7XEnv exhibits resistance to NAbs that\nbind CD4-induced epitopes. Relative to WT, 7XEnv displays a higher\nbinding affinity for CD4-Ig, but reduced affinities for 17b and 447-52D,\nwhich recognize CD4-induced epitopes, even in the presence of sCD4.\nsmFRET analysis suggests that 7XEnv samples more open conformations in\nthe unliganded state relative to WT but does not undergo the downstream\nconformational changes in response to CD4 binding. 7XEnv exhibits\nreduced sCD4-induced gp120 shedding, demonstrating that the gp120-gp41\ninteraction is stabilized by the Env mutations despite a higher affinity\nof 7XEnv for CD4. The CH185-derived Env mutants H3-16 and H4-14, like\nthe NL4-3--derived 7XEnv, exhibit increased CD4 binding but were more\nresistant to CD4-induced conformational changes than 7XEnv. H3-16 and\nH4-14 showed reduced cold inactivation, and reduced eCD4-Ig--induced\ngp120 shedding relative to WT. We speculate that the Env mutations that\nprovide high-level resistance to DTG in the SupT1 T cell line exhibit\nhigher energy barriers for CD4-induced conformational activation,\nresulting in impaired cell-free viral infection and fusion. In turn,\nbecause the binding affinity of mutant Env for CD4 is high, and the\npropensity for CD4-induced conformational change in Env is low, mutant\nEnv trimers on infected cells or budding virions may be able to stably\ninteract with CD4 on neighboring target cells and more efficiently form\nVSs compared to WT. Cryo--electron tomography studies of Env trimers\ninteracting with membrane-bound CD4 have revealed several stable\nCD4-bound conformational intermediates before activation ( *66* ).\nStable Env-CD4 interactions would promote the formation of strong VSs,\nleading to enhanced cell-cell transfer observed with the heavily mutated\nEnvs.\n\nIn addition to accumulating multiple Env mutations, we observed that in\nthe presence of high concentrations of DTG, independent of viral strain,\nHIV-1 consistently acquired mutations in the NC domain of Gag. NC\nmutations were not identified during propagation of HIV-1 in the\npresence of EFdA. The selected NC mutations confer modest levels of\nresistance to INSTIs but not to RT inhibitors. The effects of the NC\nmutations on conferring INSTI resistance are additive with IN mutations.\nThese results indicate that the selected NC mutations are INSTI-specific\nresistance mutations. Further study is needed to elucidate the mechanism\nby which mutations in NC reduce the susceptibility of HIV-1 to INSTIs.\n\nWe demonstrate that the Env variants selected in the presence of DTG\nexhibit multi-log resistance to INSTIs in spreading infections but more\nmodest (\\~10-fold) resistance to RT and PR inhibitors and \\~2- to 3-fold\nresistance to the entry inhibitor T-20 and the capsid inhibitor LEN. On\nthe basis of our model that the mechanism of Env-mediated drug\nresistance is linked to increased MOI conferred by enhanced cell-cell\ntransfer capacity, we investigated whether the antiviral activity of\nINSTIs is more readily overwhelmed by high MOI relative to that of other\nclasses of ARVs. These experiments were performed using\nVSV-G--pseudotyped eGFP reporter virus. We found that RT inhibitors, a\nPR inhibitor, LEN, and an ALLINI could completely block virus infection\neven at high MOI. In contrast, we found that INSTIs, while being very\npotent inhibitors at low MOI, are not capable of completely blocking\nvirus infection under high-MOI conditions. No eGFP signal was seen with\nthe catalytically inactive IN mutant IN-D116N, indicating that the eGFP\nsignal detected at high MOI in our assays is not produced by\nunintegrated viral DNA known to accumulate when integration is blocked (\n*56* , *67* ). Consistent with previous studies ( *33* , *34* ), the\nNRTI FTC and NRTTI EFdA require higher concentrations to inhibit viral\ninfection in the context of high MOI relative to an NNRTI, which is\nhighly effective against high-MOI conditions even at relatively low drug\nconcentrations (see slopes of the inhibition curves in Fig. 10, D to F\n).\n\nTo explore further the phenomenon of INSTI resistance conferred by high\nMOI, we devised an abrogation assay whereby cells were coinfected with a\nfixed amount of VSV-G--pseudotyped eGFP reporter virus and increasing\namounts of virus not encoding a fluorescent reporter (so-called dark\nvirus). This approach allowed us to confirm that the inhibitory activity\nof an INSTI, but not an RT inhibitor, could be overwhelmed by high MOI.\nDark virus bearing inactivating mutations in RT or IN was unable to\novercome INSTI antiviral activity, indicating that reverse transcription\nis required for the abrogating activity. Furthermore, because the\ncatalytically inactive IN mutant (IN-D116N) may not be able to form an\nintasome capable of INSTI binding ( *68* ), the results suggest that\nformation of a functional intasome is required for abrogation. We\nspeculate that under high-MOI conditions large numbers of functional\nintasomes in an infected cell can \"swamp out\" the ability of INSTIs to\ncompletely block all viral complexes. This phenomenon is illustrated in\nfig. S7 using the analogy of soldiers crossing a moat to capture a\ncastle; while most soldiers (viruses) are blocked by the moat (antiviral\ndrug), if enough soldiers attempt to cross the moat (high MOI), at least\none will be successful and take the castle (establish a productive\ninfection). In this study, high MOI is conferred by the increased\nability of the selected heavily mutated Envs to mediate cell-cell\ntransfer. In theory, however, mutations that greatly increase the\nefficiency of cell-free infection (infection by free virions) could\nenhance the efficiency of infection and also reduce the susceptibility\nof HIV-1 to INSTIs.\n\nWe speculate that the differential effect of MOI on RT inhibitors versus\nINSTIs is likely due to their different mechanisms of action. Reverse\ntranscription involves thousands of catalytic events per infection\ncycle, providing a large number of opportunities for RT inhibitors to\nblock productive infection; in contrast, each productive infection cycle\nrequires only a single integration event. INSTIs exhibit very slow\ndissociation rates from the intasome ( *69* ), perhaps allowing\nintasomes to \"soak up\" INSTIs present in the cell, reducing their\neffective concentration. Even a single intasome not bound to drug could\ncarry out successful integration, leading to a productive infection\nevent. Further analysis will be needed to fully decipher the\nmechanism(s) by which high MOIs, whether conferred by highly efficient\ncell-free or cell-cell infection, reduce the susceptibility of HIV-1 to\nINSTIs. It is important to note that while ALLINIs, like INSTIs, target\nIN, these two classes of inhibitors have very different mechanisms of\naction. INSTIs target integration itself (specifically, strand\ntransfer), whereas ALLINIs act primarily late in the replication cycle\nby inducing IN aggregation, thereby preventing IN from promoting the\npackaging of viral genomic RNA into the capsid during maturation ( *70*\n).\n\nThe results presented here and in our previous studies ( *45* , *46* )\nraise the key question of whether Env and/or NC mutations contribute to\nvirological failure in individuals treated with INSTI-containing\nregimens. A number of studies have reported INSTI failure in people\nliving with HIV in the absence of drug resistance mutations in IN ( *7*\n, *10* , *11* ). However, systematic evaluation of Env and NC mutations\nin these individuals has not been conducted. Analysis of Env mutations\nin patient-derived material is particularly challenging given the high\ndegree of sequence variation across Env ( *71* ) and the context\ndependence of Env mutations described here; i.e., different viral clones\nlead to distinct panels of mutations, making it difficult to draw\nconclusions based simply on viral genotyping. It will therefore be\nnecessary to perform labor-intensive phenotypic analysis of *env* genes\nderived from individuals failing INSTI-containing regimens.\nNevertheless, our data point to several features conserved across viral\nsubtypes that are associated with INSTI resistance: mutations at the\ngp120/gp41 interface and the V1/V2 region, increased stability of the\ngp120/gp41 interaction, and enhanced cell-cell viral transmission.\nAlthough the role of cell-cell transfer and the prevalence of multicopy\ninfection in PLWH remains a matter of debate, analyses thus far, to our\nknowledge, have not been performed in the context of INSTI failure.\nGiven our finding that the antiviral potency of INSTIs can be\noverwhelmed by high MOI, it appears plausible that INSTI therapy may be\nmore likely to drive the evolution of mutations that confer highly\nefficient cell-cell transfer relative to other drug regimens. On the\nbasis of our observations that Env mutations are able to rescue the\nreplication defects imposed by established drug resistance mutations in\nIN (fig. S3), we suggest that Env mutations, by facilitating more\nefficient virus replication, may increase the opportunity for the virus\nto acquire drug resistance mutations in IN. According to this\nhypothesis, Env mutations could serve as \"stepping stones\" on the path\nto achieving high-level resistance conferred by target-gene mutations.\nThus, moving forward, analysis of patient samples should include both\nsamples with, and without, resistance mutations in IN. We consider it\nunlikely that, in vivo, mutations in Env will confer the multi-log INSTI\nresistance observed here, as highly efficient cell-cell transfer would\nlikely lead to virus-induced cytopathic effect and detection of infected\ncells by the host immune system ( *44* , *72* , *73* ). However, even in\nthe absence of multicopy infection, mutations that increase the MOI\nwould likely contribute to the acquisition of drug resistance (as\nillustrated in fig. S7) particularly in the context of INSTI-containing\nregimens.\n\nIt is important to note that individuals on PI-containing regimens have\nalso been reported to experience virological failure in the absence of\nmutations in PR ( *8* , *9* , *13* ). Mutations in the CT of gp41 have\nbeen associated with PI resistance in vivo ( *12* ), and mutations in\nthe gp41 HR region analogous to the gp41 HR mutations reported here and\npreviously ( *45* , *46* ) were also associated with PI failure ( *8* ).\n\nIn summary, the findings of this study demonstrate the importance of\nmutations outside drug-target genes in resistance to ARVs and\ndemonstrate that INSTIs are particularly sensitive to high-MOI\nconditions. These data suggest that a full understanding of HIV-1 drug\nresistance will require exploring the contribution of mutations outside\ndrug-target genes to virological failure. As more-potent drugs with\nhigher genetic barriers to resistance are developed, it may become\nincreasingly important to identify and elucidate such unconventional\ndrug resistance pathways. We refer here to this phenomenon as drug\nepistasis, whereby a drug that targets the product of one gene leads to\nthe acquisition of mutations in another gene.\n\n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Cell lines\n\nHeLa, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T, and TZM-bl ( *74* ) cells were\nmaintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10%\nfetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C in 5% CO ~2~ .

Alpart (Emmune Inc., FL). BI-224436 ( *57* ) was a gift\nfrom A. Engelman (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA).\n\n### Plasmids\n\nThe full-length HIV-1 molecular clones pNL4-3 ( *47* ), pNL(AD8) ( *51*\n), and CH185 (previously denoted K3016, a gift from C. Ochsenbauer and\nJ. Kappes, University of Alabama) ( *50* ) were used in this study.\npBR-NL43-IRES-eGFP-nef ^+^ (pBR43IeG), a proviral clone that coexpresses\nNef and eGFP from a single bicistronic RNA, was obtained from F.\nKirchhoff (Ulm University Medical Center, Germany) through the NIH HIV\nReagent Program ( *58* ). pNL4-3 Env-A541V (Env-A539V, NL4-3 numbering)\nwas described previously ( *45* , *46* ). The pBR43IeG/KFS clone, which\ndoes not express Env, was described previously ( *45* , *46* ). The\nVSV-G--expressing plasmid, pHCMVG, was a gift from J. Burns ( *75* ).\nMutations in Gag-, RT-, and IN-coding regions were introduced into\npNL4-3--based plasmids by overlap polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\n### Preparation of virus stocks\n\nThe HEK293T and HeLa cell lines were transfected with HIV-1 proviral DNA\nusing Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). VSV-G--pseudotyped viruses were\nprepared by cotransfecting HEK293T cells with pBR43IeG KFS harboring\nWT-IN or IN-D116N, and pHCMVG, at DNA ratios of 10:1 or 5:1. At 48 hours\nafter transfection, virus-containing supernatants were passed through a\n0.45-μm membrane filter (Merck Millipore). The amount of virus in the\nsupernatant was quantified by RT assay. RT assays were performed as\ndescribed previously ( *45* ) with minor modifications. Briefly, after\nincubation of the virus supernatants with RT reaction mixtures, which\ncontained a template primer of poly(rA) (5 μg/ml) and oligo(dT)12--18\nprimers (1.57 μg/ml), in 50 mM tris (pH 7.8), 75 mM KCl, 2 mM\ndithiothreitol, 5 mM MgCl ~2~ , 0.05% NP-40, and 0.25 μCi of ^32^ P-dTTP\n(3′-deoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate) at 37°C for 3 hours, the mixtures\nwere spotted onto positively charged nylon membrane (MilliporeSigma).\nAfter washing the nylon membranes with 2× SSC buffer (300 mM NaCl and 30\nmM sodium citrate), levels of bound ^32^ P were measured on a Wallac\nMicroBeta ^2^ microplate counter (PerkinElmer). The 50% tissue culture\ninfectious dose (TCID ~50~ ) of the virus stocks was determined using\nTZM-bl cells. Briefly, 1.0 × 10 ^4^ TZM-bl cells were incubated with\nserially diluted virus stocks in the presence of diethylaminoethyl\n(DEAE)--dextran (30 μg/ml). At 48 hours after infection, luciferase\nactivity was measured using the Britelite plus reporter gene assay\nsystem (PerkinElmer) and GloMax Navigator microplate luminometer\n(Promega). TCID ~50~ was calculated according to the Reed-Muench method\n( *76* ).\n\n### Long-term passaging of HIV-1 in the presence of ARVs\n\nSelection of HIV-1 variants resistant to ARVs was performed by serial\npassaging of NL4-3 in the SupT1 (NL4-3 and derivatives) or SupT1huR5\n\\[NL(AD8) and CH185\\] T cell lines with increasing concentrations of DTG\nor EFdA. The culture supernatant was harvested on day 7 and used to\ninfect fresh cells for the next round of culture in the presence of the\nsame or increasing concentrations of the compounds. Dose escalation was\nperformed when a cytopathic effect was observed. At the indicated time\npoints, genomic DNA was extracted from infected cells using the DNeasy\nBlood and Tissue Minikit (Qiagen), and the Gag-, Pol-, Env-, and\nNef-coding regions were amplified by PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase\n(Takara Bio) and sequenced (Psomagen or Poochon Scientific) using\npreviously described primers ( *77* , *78* ).\n\n### Construction of infectious molecular clones containing Env mutants\n\nThe Env mutants were constructed by the overlap PCR method ( *79* ). For\n7XEnv\\*, the entire *env* region was amplified from genomic DNA from\nNL4-3--infected cells using the following primers ( *79* ): NL(6232)F\n(5′-AGCAGAAGACAGTGGCAATGAGAGTGAAG-3′) and EnvR\n(5′-TTTTGACCACTTGCCACCCATCTTATAGC-3′) (ref). A fragment encompassing the\nEco RI restriction site in pNL4-3 was amplified using NL(5284)F\n(5′-GGTCAGGGAGTCTCCATAGAA-TGGAGG-3′) and NL(6232)Rv\n(5′-CTTCACTCTCATTGCCACT-GTCTTCTGCT-3′). Another fragment encompassing\nthe Xho I restriction site in pNL4-3 was amplified using NL(8779)F\n(5′-GCTA-TAAGATGGGTGGCAAGTGGTCAAAA-3′) and NL(9045)R\n(5′-GATCTACAGCTGCCTTGTAAGTCATTGGTC-3′). Overlap PCR was performed using\nthese three PCR products and primers NL(5284)F and NL(9045)R. The\nchimeric *env* amplicon was cloned into pNL4-3 using Eco RI and Xho I\nrestriction sites. For 7XEnv, the Vpu-V60L/SP-K6N in 7XEnv\\* was mutated\nback to the WT sequence by overlap PCR. pBR43IeG 7XEnv was constructed\nusing Age I and Xho I restriction sites in WT pNL4-3 and 7XEnv. For\nCH185 heavily mutated clones (H3-16 and H4-14), the entire *env* regions\nwere amplified using K3016_env_startF (5′-AGTGGCAATGAGAGCGA-3′) and\nK3016_env_end R (5′-CATTTTATAGCAAAGCTGCT-3′). A fragment encompassing\nthe Pac I restriction site in pK3016 was amplified using K3016_Pac I_F\n(5′-GGAGCCAGTAGATCCTAAC-CTAGAG-3′) and K3016_env_startR\n(5′-TCGCTCTCATTG-CCACT-3′). Another fragment encompassing the Xho I\nrestriction site in pK3016 was amplified using K3016_env_end_F\n(5′-AGCAGCTTTGCTATAAAATG-3′) and K3016_Xho I_R\n(5′-CCCGGCGTGTCAATAATATCAC-3′). Overlap PCR was performed using these\nthree PCR products and primers K3016_Pac I_F and K3016_Xho I_R. The\nchimeric *env* amplicon was cloned into pCH185 using Pac I and Xho I\nrestriction sites. Constructed plasmids were verified by Sanger DNA\nsequencing (Psomagen).\n\n### Virus replication kinetic assays\n\nVirus replication was monitored in SupT1 cells as previously described (\n*45* ). Briefly, SupT1 cells were incubated with pNL4-3 clones (1.0 μg\nof DNA/1.0 × 10 ^6^ cells) in the presence of DEAE-dextran (700 μg/ml)\nat 37°C for 15 min. Transfected cells (1.5 × 10 ^5^ cells) were plated\nin 96-well flat-bottom plates and incubated at 37°C in the presence of\nvarious concentrations of ARVs. For CCR5-tropic viruses, SupT1huR5 cells\nwere used. Aliquots of supernatants were collected to measure RT\nactivity, and cells were split 1:3 every other day with fresh drug and\nmedium. IC ~50~ values were calculated on the basis of the AUC of the\nreplication kinetics. IC ~50~ was defined as the amount of inhibitor\nrequired to reduce the AUC by 50%.\n\n### Single-round, cell-free virus infectivity assays\n\nSingle-round infectivity assays were performed as previously described\nwith minor modifications ( *45* ). TZM-bl cells (1.0 × 10 ^4^ cells) in\n96-well plates were incubated with RT-normalized virus stocks produced\nin HeLa cells. For drug sensitivity assays, 100 TCID ~50~ of virus\nproduced in 293T cells was incubated with TZM-bl cells (1.0 × 10 ^4^\ncells) in the presence of various concentrations of drugs or NAbs with\nDEAE-dextran (30 μg/ml). At 48 hours after infection, luciferase\nactivity was measured using the Britelite plus reporter gene assay\nsystem (PerkinElmer) and GloMax Navigator microplate luminometer\n(Promega).\n\n### Cell-cell fusion assay\n\nHEK293T cells were transfected with HIV-1 proviral DNA as described\nabove. At 24 hours after transfection, serial dilutions of the\ntransfected HEK293T cells were cocultured with 1.0 × 10 ^4^ TZM-bl cells\nin the presence of a cocktail of RPV and DTG (1000 nM each) to prevent\nviral infection. At 24 hours after coculture, luciferase activity was\nmeasured as described above.\n\n### Cell-cell transfer assay\n\nVirus-producing cells were prepared by spinoculation (2500 *g* for 2.5\nhours). Target cells were labeled with 1.0 μM dye from the CellTrace Far\nRed Cell Proliferation kit (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours after\nspinoculation, virus-producing cells were cocultured with the same\nnumber of dye-labeled target cells in the absence or presence of DTG or\nRPV. The number of virus-producing cells was normalized by intracellular\np24 antigen before coculture. In parallel with coculture experiments,\nvirus-producing cells were seeded onto the insert of a transwell\n(Corning) with the labeled target cells in the lower chamber to measure\ncell-free viral infection. Twenty-four hours after coculture, the cells\nwere fixed and permeabilized, and then incubated with\nKC57-FITC--conjugated Ab to stain intracellular p24 antigen. For\ncell-cell transfer assay using eGFP reporter virus, 1.0 μM EFV was added\nto the culture 24 hours after coculture of virus-producing cells with\nthe target cells, and then the cultures were incubated for an additional\n24 hours. Samples were analyzed with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) flow\ncytometer.\n\n### Infection with VSV-G--pseudotyped eGFP reporter viruses\n\nThe SupT1 T cell line was incubated with VSV-G--pseudotyped eGFP\nreporter viruses over a range of viral inputs at 37°C for 2 hours. For\ncompetition experiments, the SupT1 T cell line was incubated with a\nfixed amount of VSV-G--pseudotyped eGFP reporter virus with varying\namounts of VSV-G--pseudotyped HIV-1 (dark virus). Following incubation,\nthe cells were washed and cultured in the presence or absence of drugs.\nForty-eight after infection, eGFP expression was monitored by flow\ncytometry using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were\nanalyzed by FCS Express Cytometry software 7 (De Novo Software) or\nFlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.).\n\n### Gp120 shedding assay\n\nThe gp120 shedding assay was performed as previously described ( *45* ).\nBriefly, concentrated viruses produced from HeLa cells were incubated\nwith sCD4 or eCD4-Ig at 37°C for 2 hours. Following incubation, the\nviruses were purified by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose\ncushions (60,000 *g* ) for 45 min at 4°C. The levels of\nvirion-associated gp160, gp120, and p24 were determined by Western\nblotting. Viral proteins were separated by SDS--polyacrylamide gel\nelectrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene disulfide membranes\n(Merck Millipore). After blocking the membranes with Azure Fluorescent\nBlot Blocking Buffer (Azure Biosystems), the membranes were probed with\n16H3 (1:10,000) and HIVIg (1:10,000) at 4°C overnight and then incubated\nfor 1 hour with species-specific AzureSpectra Fluorescent Secondary\nAntibodies (Azure Biosystems). After the final washes, bands were\ndetected by chemiluminescence with a Sapphire Biomolecular imager (Azure\nBiosystems). Quantification was performed using Image Studio Lite\n(LI-COR Biosciences) software.\n\n### Cold sensitivity assay\n\nCold sensitivity assay was performed as previously described with minor\nmodifications ( *21* ). Virus aliquots (100 to 200 TCID ~50~ ) were\nincubated at 4°C for different periods of time up to 120 hours.\nFollowing incubations, the viruses were stored at −80°C until infection.\nThe frozen aliquots were quickly thawed at 37°C and incubated with 1.0 ×\n10 ^4^ TZM-bl cells. Forty-eight hours after infection, luciferase\nactivity was measured as described above.\n\n### Ab binding assay\n\nHEK293T cells were transfected with pBR43IeG constructs as indicated\nabove. At 48 hours after transfection, the cells were detached with 5 mM\nEDTA--phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and washed with PBS. Cells (2.0 ×\n10 ^5^ ) were incubated with the specified Abs at a final concentration\nof 1.0 to 3.0 μg/ml at 37°C. After 30 min of incubation, the cells were\nwashed with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 647--conjugated goat\nanti-human IgG Ab (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For CH185 Env mutants,\nintracellular p24 was stained with FITC-conjugated anti-p24 Ab after Env\nstaining. The cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4%\nparaformaldehyde (Boston Biosciences). Fixed cells were analyzed with a\nFACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. Data were analyzed by FCS\nExpress Cytometry Software 7 (De Novo Software) and FlowJo software\n(Tree Star Inc.). The Alexa Fluor 647 signal was normalized by eGFP or\np24-FITC signals.\n\n### smFRET analysis of HIV-1 Env\n\nHIV-1 NL4-3ΔRT virus particles containing WT or 7X Env were produced,\nlabeled, and analyzed by smFRET as described previously ( *20* ).\nBriefly, HEK293T cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and transfected with\nNL4-3ΔRT plasmids encoding untagged and V1Q3/V4A1 peptide-tagged Env at\na 40:1 ratio. Each dish was transfected with a total of 10 mg of DNA\nusing PEI. Virus particles were harvested at 48 hours after\ntransfection, passed through 0.45-mm syringe filters, and pelleted\nthrough 15% sucrose cushions. Viruses were then labeled overnight at\nambient temperature with donor (Cy3) and acceptor (Cy5) fluorophores\nusing recombinant acyl carrier protein synthase (ACPS) and\ntransglutaminase enzymes. Viruses were then incubated with\n1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-\\[biotinyl(polyethylene\nglycol)-2000\\] (ammonium salt) (DSPE)--biotin lipid and purified using\ncontinuous 6 to 18% iodixanol gradients. Purified virus particles were\nimmobilized on streptavidin-passivated fused silica slides, placed in\nimaging buffer containing an enzymatic oxygen scavenging system and\ntriplet-state quenchers, and imaged on a custom-built prism total\ninternal reflection fluorescence microscope. For sCD4 experiments, virus\nparticles were incubated with sCD4 proteins at 100 μg/ml for 60 min at\nambient temperature before imaging. Particles were also imaged in the\npresence of sCD4 at the same concentration. smFRET data were analyzed in\nMATLAB using the SPARTAN analysis suite and custom MATLAB scripts ( *80*\n).\n\n\n**Funding:** Research in the Freed laboratory was supported by the\nIntramural Research Program of the Center for Cancer Research, National\nCancer Institute, NIH.

HIV susceptibility to DTG and RAL was determined using short-term resistance assays with TZM-bl cells, as described previously (8).\";  The addition of R262K to H51Y decreases HIV-1 susceptibility to DTG. To further characterize the R262K secondary substitution in the presence of H51Y, we performed resistance assays using TZM-bl cells and various concentrations of DTG or RAL ( Fig. 4 ), which generated EC 50 s for each virus as well as fold change (FC) values ( Table 2 ). Although the primary H51Y substitution did not confer resistance against DTG or RAL (FC values of 1.25 and 0.98, respectively), consistent with previous results ( 11 ), the addition of R262K did result in low-level but significant biochemical resistance to DTG but not to RAL (FC values of 1.9 and 0.92, respectively).\"\nRationale: The paper includes in vitro drug susceptibility data, specifically examining the susceptibility of HIV-1 to dolutegravir (DTG) and raltegravir (RAL) using short-term resistance assays with TZM-bl cells.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 25956162\nQuestion ID: 12\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\nEvidence: Analysis of two cases of virological failure during raltegravir-based therapy showed that the accumulation and the rapid evolution of primary INSTI resistance-associated mutations coincided with the S119R mutation. To further assess the clinical significance of these results in the context of S119R and the INSTI resistance-associated mutations, we analyzed two cases of clinical and virological failure during RAL-based therapy using the clinical histories and the deep sequencing-based HIV-1 genotyping results of two individuals ( Fig. 3 ).\nRationale: The paper describes two cases of virological failure during raltegravir-based therapy, indicating that sequences were obtained from individuals experiencing virological failure.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 38206187\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: \"We measured the phenotypic susceptibility to doravirine in site-directed mutants containing V106I, V106A, V106M, or Y188L mutations in a subtype B (NL4-3) and CRF02_AG genetic background, and in a subset of recombinant viruses with clinically derived RT-RNAse H coding region harboring V106I and no other major NNRTI RAMs. The methodology has been previously described by Malet et al [11]. Briefly, RT mutants of HIV-1 were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quikchange II XL mutagenesis kit (Agilent) using specific primers introducing the expected mutations into plasmids pNL4-3, pHXB2, and pCRF02_AG. After mutagenesis, all constructs were sequenced to verify the presence of the mutations and the plasmids were prepared using the NucleoBond midi preparation kit (Macherey Nagel). Viral stocks were obtained by transfecting 293-T cells with the mutagenized HIV-1 molecular clones or the linearized pNL4-3ΔRT-RNAseH vector together with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicon including the corresponding RT-RNAseH coding region from each clinical sample, as previously described [12]. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the viral supernatants were recovered, quantified through the evaluation of the expression of β-galactosidase in TZM-bl cells, and frozen at −80°C.\n\nIn vitro susceptibility to doravirine was determined through a TZM-bl cell-based assay previously shown to correlate well with the reference phenotypic Phenosense Assay [13]. Briefly, 10 000 TZM-bl cells/well were infected with the wild-type NL4-3 strain or NNRTI-resistant viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05 in the presence of 5-fold dilutions of doravirine (MedChemExpress) ranging from 1 μM to 0.512 pM. After 48 hours, cells were treated with Glo-Lysis buffer (Promega) and the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay (Promega), then relative luminescence units were measured through the GloMax Discover instrument (Promega) and elaborated with GraphPad software to calculate 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) values. Fold-change (FC) values were calculated with respect to the IC50 value obtained with the NL4-3 wild-type strain.  Background\nLimited data are available regarding the susceptibility of the reverse transcriptase V106I polymorphism to doravirine.\n\n Methods\nDoravirine susceptibility was measured in site-directed mutants (SDMs) containing V106A, V106M, and Y188L mutations in subtype B (NL4-3, HXB2) and CRF02_AG background and in new recombinant viruses with RT harboring V106I from clinical isolates.\n\n Results\nThe V106I subtype B was detected in 1523 of 26 428 sequences, showing a 3.2% in B and 2.6% in non-B subtypes, and was higher in subtype F (8.1%) and D (14.3%). Fold-changes (FC) in susceptibility for SDMs were below doravirine biological cutoff (3.0) for V106I, but not for V106A, V106M, and Y188L. Clinically derived viruses tested included 22 B (median FC, 1.2; interquartile range [IQR], 0.9–1.6) and 28 non-B subtypes (median FC, 1.8; IQR, 0.9–3.0). Nine (18%) viruses showed FC values equal or higher than the doravirine biological FC cutoff.\"\nRationale: The paper  describes the methodology used to measure the phenotypic susceptibility of various HIV-1 mutants to doravirine. This includes creating site-directed mutants with specific mutations (V106I, V106A, V106M, Y188L) in different genetic backgrounds (subtype B NL4-3 and CRF02_AG), as well as using recombinant viruses from clinical samples. The susceptibility was assessed using a TZM-bl cell-based assay across a range of doravirine concentrations, and IC50 values (50% inhibition concentration) were calculated to determine the drug's effectiveness against these mutants.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 25552724\nQuestion ID: 1\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\nEvidence: \"Two resistance selection studies performed in our laboratory with the investigative drugs MK-2048 and S/GSK139572 (DTG) yielded the G118R mutation in subtype C ( 20 ) and CRF02_AG ( 16 ) integrases, respectively.

Notably, viruses with these doravirine RAMs remained susceptible to rilpivirine and efavirenz. This contrasted with rilpivirine where acquisition of E138K, L100I and/or K101E resulted in >50-fold cross-resistance to all NNRTIs.

Lenacapavir (LEN) is a novel\ncapsid inhibitor that inhibits HIV-1 at multiple stages throughout the\nviral life cycle. ISL and LEN are being investigated as once-weekly\ncombination oral therapy for the treatment of HIV-1. Here, we\ncharacterized ISL and LEN *in vitro* to assess combinatorial antiviral\nactivity, cytotoxicity, and the potential for interactions between the\ntwo compounds. Bliss analysis revealed ISL with LEN demonstrated\nadditive inhibition of HIV-1 replication, with no evidence of antagonism\nacross the range of concentrations tested. ISL exhibited potent\nantiviral activity against variants encoding known LEN\nresistance-associated mutations (RAMs) with or without the presence of\nM184V, an ISL RAM in reverse transcriptase (RT) . Static resistance\nselection experiments were conducted with ISL and LEN alone and in\ncombination, initiating with either wild-type virus or virus containing\nthe M184I RAM in RT to further assess their barrier to the emergence of\nresistance. The combination of ISL with LEN more effectively suppressed\nviral breakthrough at lower multiples of the compounds' IC ~50~\n(half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values and fewer mutations\nemerged with the combination compared to either compound on its own. The\nknown pathways for development of resistance with ISL and LEN were not\naltered, and no novel single mutations emerged that substantially\nreduced susceptibility to either compound. The lack of antagonism and\ncross-resistance between ISL and LEN support the ongoing evaluation of\nthe combination for treatment of HIV-1.\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n### Multiple-cycle antiviral assay in MT4 cells which express green fluorescent protein upon infection (MT4-GFP cells)\n\nISL and LEN were evaluated for their ability to prevent HIV-1 infection\nin MT4-GFP cells as described in Diamond et al. ( 6 ). In this method,\nHIV-1 replication is monitored using MT4-gag-GFP clone D3, MT4 cells\nwith a GFP reporter gene, the expression of which is dependent on the\nHIV-1 expressed proteins, Tat and Rev ( 13 ). Infection of MT4-GFP cells\nwith HIV-1 results in GFP expression approximately 24 h post-infection.\nProviral variants used for these studies were generated by site-directed\nmutagenesis in the WT R8 proviral plasmid ( 14 ). Virus was produced by\ntransfection in 293T cells.\n\nBriefly, MT4-GFP cells were cultured overnight with the appropriate\nHIV-1 variant at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) that resulted in\napproximately 100 green (infected) cells at 48 h post-infection in the\nwells containing no inhibitor. This was done to ensure similar assay\nsignal-to-noise ratios between experiments and to enable work with viral\nvariants demonstrating a range of viral fitness properties. After \\~19 h\nof infection, the cells were washed and resuspended in assay media\ncontaining normal human serum (NHS) before their addition to 384-well\ncompound plates containing 10-point serial 3-fold dilutions of ISL or\nLEN. Controls included no inhibitor \\[dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) only\\]\nand a combination of three antiviral agents, efavirenz, indinavir, and\nthe integrase strand transfer inhibitor, L-002254051, at final\nconcentrations of 4 µM each. The infected/treated cells were cultured at\n37°C, 5% carbon dioxide, and 90% humidity until evaluation of infection\nwas conducted at approximately 48 and 72 h post-infection by counting\nthe number of green fluorescent cells in each well using an Acumen ^e^\nX3 scanner (TTP Labtech Inc., Melbourn, UK). The reproductive ratio, *R*\n, was calculated by dividing the number of infected cells at 72 h by the\nnumber at 48 h post-infection. The percent inhibition caused by a test\ncompound is calculated by the following formula:\n\n\\% inhibition = \\[1 − ( *R* ~test\\ compound~ -- *R* ~positive\\ control~\n)\\] / ( *R* ~DMSO\\ only~ -- *R* ~positive\\ control~ ) × 100%.\n\nThe dose-response curves of each test compound were plotted as percent\ninhibition versus the test concentration. IC ~50~ values were determined\nby a non-linear four˗parameter curve fitting of the dose-response curve\ndata. Fold-change compared to WT was used to assess antiviral activity\nacross compounds and variants.\n\n### Antiviral activity of the combination of ISL with LEN\n\nThe antiviral assay described above was utilized to test the antiviral\nactivity of the combination of ISL with LEN. Using WT R8 (subtype B)\nvirus infection of MT4-GFP cells, a matrix of ISL and LEN concentrations\nwas tested, with each cross-titration performed in quadruplicate.\nBriefly, ISL was evaluated using a 12.81-nM high-test concentration with\neight additional dilutions (concentration range: 0.50--12.81 nM). Each\ndilution of ISL was tested in combination with six dilutions of LEN\n(concentration range = 0.021--5.0 nM). Each compound was also tested on\nits own. As a positive control for an antagonistic combination,\nstavudine (d4T, concentration range: 10 nM to 3 µM), was combined with\nribavirin (RBV, concentration range: 4.1 nM to 27.0 µM). Cytotoxicity\nwas also assessed after 24-h incubation on a separate plate with\nuninfected MT4-GFP cells using the CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega).\nAnalysis of the combined antiviral activities and cytotoxicity was\nconducted using the MacSynergy II three-dimensional model for\nstatistical evaluation of drug-drug interactions ( 15 ).\n\n### Static resistance selection method for ISL/LEN combinations\n\n*In vitro* selection experiments were performed in 96-well plates using\nR8 (subtype B) WT virus or R8 virus encoding M184I RT, with ISL and LEN\nalone or in combination at concentrations defined by fixed multiples\nover each compound's IC ~50~ against R8 WT virus, previously determined\nin the multiple-cycle antiviral assay in MT4-GFP cells with 10% NHS (ISL\nIC ~50~ = 0.79 nM, LEN IC ~50~ = 0.087 nM). Compound plates were\nprepared with 1 µL of each compound at 200× the final concentration (2\nµL total) and stored at −80°C. One 96-well plate was used for each\ncompound alone or the combination. Different inhibitor concentrations\n(indicated as fold multiples of WT IC ~50~ ) were studied across the\ncolumns (see Fig. 3A and 4A; Table S1 ) . Rows A--H represent eight\nindependent replicates of the concentrations studied in columns 1--12.\n\nFor cell culture, MT4-GFP cells were infected in bulk with R8 WT virus\nor R8 virus encoding M184I RT at a high MOI of 5. Seventy thousand\ninfected cells were added per well to a room temperature compound plate\nfor a final volume of 200 µL per well. Plates were incubated for 4  days\nat 37°C, 5% carbon dioxide, and 90% humidity prior to initiation of the\nnext selection passage. The supernatant was passaged to a new compound\nplate with uninfected MT4-GFP cells every 3--4  days, and the compound\nconcentrations were kept constant throughout the experiment. The number\nof GFP-positive cells in each well was monitored at each passage using\nan Acumen eX3 scanner (TTP Labtech Inc.). Viral breakthrough was defined\nas a well with \\>100 GFP-positive cells. Using this criterion, the\nnumber of wells with breakthrough stabilized by passage 6; six\nadditional passages were performed before genotyping was conducted.\n\nAnalysis of CA or RT mutation(s) in the breakthrough viruses from the\nresistance selection studies was performed using population-based Sanger\nsequencing at passage 12. Viral RNA was extracted with the MagMAX 96\nviral RNA isolation kit from the culture supernatant of wells with viral\nbreakthrough from the resistance studies described above. The CA or\nRT-encoding region was amplified by the one-step RT-PCR method. PCR\nproducts were genotyped by an automated population-based full-length\nsequencing method (covering amino acids 1--231 of the CA region and\n1--440 of the RT region). The primers used for PCR amplification of CA\nwere 5′- *CAACCATCCCTTCAGACAGG* -3′ (forward) and 5′-\n*GCTGTTGGCTCTGGTCTGCTC* -3′ (reverse). The sequencing primers were 5′-\n*CCAAGGAAGCCTTAGATAA* - 3′, 5′- *GTGCATGCAGGGCCTATTGC* -3′, 5′-\n*GCTGGTAGGGCTATACATTC* -3′, and 5′- *CTTTTTCCTAGGGGCCCTG* -3′. The\nprimers used for PCR amplification of RT were 5′- *AAGCAGGAGCCGATAGACAA*\n-3′ (forward) and 5′- *TAATCCCGAATCCTGCAAAGCT* -3′ (reverse). The\nsequencing primers were 5′- *CCCTGTGGAAGCAC* -3′, 5′- *GGATGTGGGCGATGC*\n-3′, 5′- *TTGACTCAGATTGGCTGCAC* -3′, and 5′- *TCCTCTGTCAGTTACATATCCT*\n-3′. Sequencing results were reported as amino acid changes compared\nwith R8 (subtype B) (accession no. KT200357.1 ) or R8 encoding M184I RT\n(RT codon 184 mutated by site-directed mutagenesis from ATG→ATA).\n\n\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### ISL with LEN demonstrated additive inhibition of HIV-1 replication with no evidence of antagonism\n\nTo assess potential antagonistic interactions between ISL and LEN that\ncould affect the ability of the combination to inhibit HIV-1\nreplication, the antiviral activities of the combination across a range\nof concentrations were evaluated in a multiple-cycle antiviral assay\nusing the combination of d4T and RBV as a positive control for\nantagonism ( 16 ). Combinations of ISL and LEN had an additive effect on\nthe inhibition of HIV-1 replication, with synergy and antagonism volumes\nof 0.31 and −4.69 nM ^2^ %, respectively ( Fig. 1A and C ). In contrast,\nthe control pair, d4T and RBV, was highly antagonistic in inhibiting\nHIV-1 replication, with an antagonism volume of −162.7 µM ^2^ % ( Fig.\n1B and C ).\n\nFig 1\n\nCombination antiviral activity and cytotoxicity results. Antiviral\nassays for the combination of ISL with LEN ( **A** ) or RBV with d4T (\n**B** ) were performed using the multiple-cycle antiviral assay in\nMT4-GFP cells infected with WT HIV-1 (R8) virus. Results were analyzed\nusing the MacSynergy II three-dimensional model for statistical\nevaluation of drug-drug interactions ( 15 ) to assess whether the\ninteractions were significantly different from additive (i.e.,\nsynergistic or antagonistic). ( **C** ) Synergy/antagonism volumes are\nshown as 95% confidence values for the combinations using the\nmultiple-cycle antiviral assay or a cytotoxicity assay in MT4-GFP cells\nand can be interpreted as follows: additive, 50 to −50; slightly\nsynergistic, \\>50 to 100; highly synergistic, \\>100; slightly\nantagonistic, \\<−50 to 100; highly antagonistic, \\<−100.\n\nTo assess whether the combination of ISL and LEN could result in\nenhanced cytotoxicity, ATP levels from uninfected MT4-GFP incubated with\nthe compounds were also measured via a cytotoxicity assay. The\ncombination of ISL with LEN did not show synergistic cytotoxicity (was\nadditive), with a synergy volume of 12.93 nM ^2^ % ( Fig. 1C ), whereas\nthe combination of d4T with RBV was slightly synergistic with respect to\ncytotoxicity, with a synergy volume of 51.74 µM ^2^ % ( Fig. 1C ).\n\nAltogether, *in vitro* ISL and LEN combination studies revealed no\nevidence of antagonism of the two drugs, with respect to inhibition of\nHIV-1 replication, and no notable enhanced cytotoxicity in MT4-GFP\ncells.\n\n### ISL exhibited potent (nM) antiviral activity against published LEN resistance-associated variants with or without M184V-containing RT, and LEN antiviral activity was not affected by the addition of RT M184V\n\nLEN RAMs in the region encoding CA have been previously reported from\n*in vitro* resistance selection studies ( 5 ). The impact of these CA\nsubstitutions on susceptibility to ISL or LEN was evaluated in parallel\nusing the MT4-GFP multiple-cycle antiviral assay in 100% NHS. The\nantiviral activities of ISL and LEN against 9 LEN resistance-associated\nvariants were compared to that against the WT R8 virus; the fold-change\nin IC ~50~ of each variant compared to WT R8 is shown for each compound\n( Fig. 2 ; Table S2). ISL maintained potent activity against all nine\nLEN resistance-associated variants, with IC ~50~ values ranging from\n0.65 to 0.96 nM, comparable to that against the WT virus. As expected (\n5 , 17 , 18 ), LEN demonstrated reduced antiviral activity against all\nof the LEN resistance-associated variants. Notably, L56I, M66I, K70N,\nQ67H/N74D, and Q67H/T107N variants resulted in more than 10-fold reduced\nsusceptibility to LEN compared to WT R8.\n\nFig 2\n\nAntiviral activity of ISL and LEN against viruses encoding published LEN\nRAMs compared to WT R8 virus in 100% NHS. The mean (+SEM) is shown for\nthe fold-change in the IC ~50~ of ISL (teal) or LEN (gray) of each\nvariant compared to WT. \\*Fold-changes for CA M66I and CA M66I/RT M184V\nwere \\>1,758.0- and \\>917.3-fold, respectively.\n\nAs mutations in the region encoding RT position 184 are the most common\nmutations associated with resistance to ISL ( 6 , 7 , 10 , -- 12 , 19 ),\nthe effects of M184V mutation combined with LEN RAMs on susceptibility\nto LEN and ISL were also examined in the MT4-GFP antiviral assay. M184V\nalone resulted in decreased susceptibility to ISL (fold-change = 6.8)\nand slightly increased susceptibility to LEN (fold-change = 0.4) ( Fig.\n2 ; Table S2). The addition of M184V to M66I, Q67H, or N74D CA mutations\ndid not result in further decreased susceptibility to ISL (fold-change =\n4.8--5.7; Fig. 2 ; Table S2). Similarly, the antiviral activity of LEN\nagainst variants with M184V, in combination with LEN RAMs, was similar\nto the activity against the variants without M184V ( Fig. 2 ; Table S2).\n\n### The combination of ISL with LEN more effectively suppressed viral breakthrough and demonstrated a higher barrier to the emergence of resistance than either compound on its own\n\nTo assess whether the combination of ISL with LEN could more effectively\nsuppress viral breakthrough than either compound on its own, static\nresistance selection experiments were conducted *in vitro* . MT4-GFP\ncells infected with WT R8 virus were treated with the combination of ISL\nand LEN at multiples of each compound's IC ~50~ against WT R8 virus (see\nFig. 3A and 4A ; Table S1 ). Parallel selection experiments were also\nconducted with ISL or LEN alone.\n\nFig 3\n\nStatic resistance selection experiment in MT4-GFP cells with WT R8\nvirus. Images of plates are shown, with green indicating wells with\nviral breakthrough (containing \\>100 GFP-expressing cells) and black\nwells indicating cells without viral breakthrough ( **A** ). Mutations\nencoding RT and CA substitutions observed in resistance selection\nexperiments at each compound's IC ~50~ multiple are also shown ( **B**\n). Substitutions are depicted by the single-letter amino acid (AA) code\nwithin the reference sequence followed by the AA position number and\nthen the single-letter AA codes predicted by the sequencing analysis.\nMultiple AA codes are shown if a mixture of AA codes for the same\nposition was observed in a single well. \"None\" indicates that no changes\nfrom the WT R8 starting virus were observed. Underlined substitutions\nrepresent those seen in more than one well across all IC ~50~ multiples\non each plate. ^a^ E28K, R277K, M357T, and N418S RT substitutions were\nobserved in a few wells in the LEN alone selection experiment in the\nsame wells as M66I or Q67H CA substitutions and are not considered\nrelevant to LEN. N418S RT substitution has been previously observed\nwithout selective pressure with the same virus stock. ^b^ T54TN was\nobserved with N74D in a single well. A14AT was observed in a single well\nwith H87HQ. Q67H was observed in a single well with H87Q.\n\nFig 4\n\nStatic resistance selection experiment in MT4-GFP cells initiated with\nRT M184I (R8) virus. Images of plates are shown, with green indicating\nwells with viral breakthrough (containing \\>100 GFP-expressing cells)\nand black wells indicating cells without viral breakthrough ( **A** ).\nMutations encoding RT and CA substitutions observed in resistance\nselection experiments at each IC ~50~ multiple are also shown as\ncompared to the RT M184I starting virus ( **B** ). Substitutions are\ndepicted by the single-letter AA code within the reference sequence\nfollowed by the AA position number and then the single-letter AA codes\npredicted by the sequencing analysis. Multiple AA codes are shown if a\nmixture of AA codes for the same position was observed in a single well.\n\"None\" indicates that no changes from the RT M184I starting virus were\nobserved. Underlined substitutions represent those seen in more than one\nwell across all IC ~50~ multiples on each plate. ^a^ There was no\nreversion of M184I observed. ^b^ T386TI substitution was observed in a\nsingle well each at 8.0- and 0.5-fold of each compound's IC ~50~ in the\nISL with LEN selection experiment and is considered a polymorphism.\n\nFor individual compound selections, ISL suppressed viral breakthrough in\nall wells with concentration of \\>8-fold of its IC ~50~ , while LEN\nsuppressed viral breakthrough in most wells with \\>16-fold of its IC\n~50~ ( Fig. 3A ). The combination of ISL with LEN effectively suppressed\nbreakthrough in all wells with compound concentrations of \\>4-fold of\neither compound's IC ~50~ . Therefore, the combination was more\neffective at suppressing viral breakthrough, at 2-fold lower multiples\ncompared to ISL alone and at 4-fold lower multiples compared to LEN\nalone.\n\nGenotypic analysis was performed on wells that demonstrated virus\nbreakthrough ( Fig. 3B ). In the ISL-only, LEN-only, and combination of\nISL with LEN selection experiments, H87Q CA mutations were observed as a\nmixture with wild-type H87 in multiple wells (H87Q without wild-type\nonly occurred in a single well). H87Q was not observed in wells without\nselective pressure (with DMSO instead of compound). Over 90% of isolates\nwith CA sequence available in the Stanford University HIV Drug\nResistance Database have Q87 rather than the consensus H87 ( 20 ),\nindicating that this mutation is likely a polymorphism and is not\nrelated to resistance.\n\nIn ISL-only selections, M184 RT mutations, typically M184I or M184MI (a\nmixture of wild type and M184I detected in the same well), were observed\nin all wells with viral breakthrough at an IC ~50~ multiple of ≥1-fold.\nIn LEN-only selection experiments, mutations encoding amino acid changes\nin CA other than H87Q were observed in 5 out of 10 wells with viral\nbreakthrough at 16- to 32-fold of the LEN IC ~50~ . M66I was detected in\ntwo wells at 32-fold of the LEN IC ~50~ . In addition to M66I, LEN-only\nselection also resulted in the following CA mutations that were only\nobserved in single occurrences at ≥16-fold the LEN IC ~50~ : A14AT,\nT54N, N74D, and Q67H. A14T and T54N CA substitutions have not been\ndescribed previously. In selections combining ISL with LEN starting with\nthe WT virus, M184 RT-encoding mutations were observed in all wells with\nbreakthrough virus at or above each compound's IC ~50~ . No CA mutations\nbesides H87HQ were observed in the combination selection experiment.\n\nSince M184I was detected in most wells with breakthrough virus selected\nagainst the combination of ISL with LEN, separate resistance selection\nexperiments were conducted, starting with an M184I RT-containing HIV-1\nin MT4-GFP cells ( Fig. 4 ). ISL alone suppressed breakthrough in most\nwells with \\>8-fold of the ISL IC ~50~ for WT virus, while LEN\nsuppressed breakthrough in most wells with \\>16-fold of its IC ~50~ (\nFig. 4A ). The combination of ISL with LEN effectively suppressed viral\nbreakthrough in all wells with \\>8-fold of each compound's IC ~50~ . The\nresults aligned with observations from selection experiments initiated\nwith the WT virus, as described above, and are consistent with the\ndecreased susceptibility of the M184I variant to ISL \\[fold-change = 6.2\n( 6 )\\].\n\nGenotypic analysis of wells with virus breakthrough was conducted for\nthe selection experiments starting with M184I RT-encoding virus.\nAnalysis revealed that M184I was maintained in all wells (there was no\nreversion of M184I to WT) from experiments conducted with each compound\nalone or with the combination ( Fig. 4B ). Furthermore, no additional\nRAMs in the region encoding RT were detected. In experiments with ISL\nalone, no changes were observed in CA. In experiments with LEN alone,\nthe M66I CA-encoding mutation was observed in one well each at 64- and\n32-fold of the LEN IC ~50~ . Additionally, N74D was observed separately\nin two wells at 32-fold of the LEN IC ~50~ , whereas N74ND was observed\nin three wells at 16-fold of the LEN IC ~50~ . In the selection\nexperiments with the combination of ISL with LEN, no mutations in the\nregion encoding CA were observed. Therefore, the genetic barrier to the\nemergence of resistance appears to be higher for the combination\ncompared to LEN alone.\n\n### No novel single mutation substantially impacted the potency of ISL or LEN\n\nSince the combination resistance selection experiments identified\nseveral novel mutations in the region encoding CA, HIV-1 variants were\nmade to evaluate their susceptibility to ISL or LEN in the\nmultiple-cycle MT4-GFP antiviral assay in 100% NHS ( Fig. 5 ; Table S3).\nISL maintained high potency against variants that contained only CA\nsubstitutions, with IC ~50~ values ranging from 0.77 to 2.77 nM, all\nwithin \\<3-fold of its potency against WT R8. In addition, ISL\nmaintained potency within 3-fold of its potency against M184I or M184V\n\\[6.2- or 6.8-fold, respectively ( 6 )\\] for the variants with a CA\nsubstitution combined with M184I or M184V RT substitution (6.3- to\n17.1-fold). Variants CA M66I/RT M184I, CA N74D/RT M184I, and CA H87Q/RT\nM184I demonstrated ISL IC ~50~ values between 6.71 and 14.34 nM, similar\nto that of M184I alone \\[6.56 nM ( 6 )\\]. Combining M184V RT and H87Q CA\nmutations resulted in a slightly larger potency shift, 17-fold less\npotent compared to WT R8, though still achieving an IC ~50~ of 18.1 nM.\n\nFig 5\n\nAntiviral activity of ISL and LEN against emergent variants from static\nresistance selection experiments in 100% NHS. The mean (+SEM) is shown\nfor the fold-change in IC ~50~ of ISL (teal) or LEN (gray) against each\nvariant compared to WT.\n\nLEN maintained high potency against most of the novel CA variants,\nincluding variants that combined M184I or M184V RT mutations ( Fig. 5 ;\nTable S3). Single-substitution variants CA A14T, T54N, and H87Q had\nsimilar susceptibility to WT with 1.2- to 1.5-fold decreased\nsusceptibility compared to WT (IC ~50~ from 2.92 to 4.21 nM).\nCombination variants CA A14T/H87Q, CA H87Q/RT M184I, and CA H87Q/RT\nM184V demonstrated IC ~50~ values ranging between 2.84 and 3.32 nM, all\nwithin 2-fold of LEN's potency against WT R8. Variants that contained CA\nmutations M66I or N74D, in combination with RT M184I, demonstrated\nreduced susceptibility to LEN similar to that observed with the same CA\nmutations in combination with RT M184V. Moreover, CA Q67H/H87Q\ndemonstrated reduced susceptibility to LEN similar to that observed with\nthe CA substitution Q67H alone (above, Fig. 2 ; Table S2). On the other\nhand, the variant with the combination of CA T54N and N74D demonstrated\na 97.5-fold reduced susceptibility to LEN compared to a 7.4- or 1.8-fold\nreduction in susceptibility for the variants with N74D or T54N alone,\nrespectively, compared to WT R8 ( Fig. 2 and 5 ; Tables S2 and S3).\n\nAltogether, while the combination resistance selection experiments\nidentified several novel CA mutations, none of the novel single\nmutations substantially impacted susceptibility of the variant to LEN or\nISL. A potential interaction between a known LEN RAM encoding CA N74D\nand a novel mutation encoding CA T54N was identified.\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nISL and LEN are in development as a once-weekly oral combination therapy\nthat has the potential to be a highly effective treatment for people\nliving with HIV-1 (PLWH). Multiple studies have previously been\nconducted to evaluate the antiviral activity and genetic barrier to\nresistance of the individual molecules *in vitro* , demonstrating high\npotency against wild-type virus and common resistance-associated\nvariants ( 6 , 8 ). Here, the activity and resistance patterns for the\ncombination were evaluated *in vitro* .\n\nFirst, antiviral assays to assess the potential interactions between ISL\nand LEN were performed. No antagonism between ISL and LEN was observed,\nand the two-drug combination demonstrated an additive effect on\ninhibiting virus replication within the concentration ranges tested.\nFurthermore, the combination did not reveal enhanced cytotoxicity.\n\nLEN RAMs in the CA-encoding region which map to the LEN-binding site\nhave previously been reported ( 5 ): variants encoding CA L56I, M66I,\nQ67H, K70N, N74D, Q67H/N74D, Q67H/N74S, and Q67H/T107N exhibited 6- to\n\\>3,200-fold reduction in susceptibility to LEN. Similarly, using the\nmultiple-cycle HIV-1 inhibition assay, these variants conferred 2.4- to\n\\>1,758-fold reduction in susceptibility to LEN. Results from each\nindividual variant were mostly within 3-fold of those previously\nreported for LEN, with L56I, Q67H/N74D, and Q67H/N74D variants having\nslightly smaller reductions (f4- to 7-fold) than those previously\nreported. Notably, ISL remained potent against all the CA variants, with\nno significant fold-changes in IC ~50~ (0.6- to 0.9-fold) observed\ncompared to WT virus. The results are consistent with previous studies\nthat showed many of these LEN resistance-associated variants remained\nsusceptible to inhibitors from other antiretroviral classes, such as\nefavirenz (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor), dolutegravir\n(integrase strand transfer inhibitor), and tenofovir alafenamide (NRTI)\n( 5 , 18 ).\n\nThe antiviral activities of ISL and LEN against variants containing\ncombinations of CA mutations (M66I, Q67H, or N74D) with the RT M184V\nmutation, a commonly reported mutation in PLWH that is associated with\nresistance to ISL, also showed an absence of cross-resistance. The\nresults revealed that the addition of M184V did not abrogate sensitivity\nto LEN, whereby the reductions in susceptibility to LEN were all within\n2-fold of that of the single CA variants. The variants also remained\nsusceptible to ISL, conferring an expected 4.8- to 5.7-fold reduction in\nsusceptibility compared to WT virus, comparable to the 6.8-fold\nreduction in susceptibility previously reported for the variant\ncontaining RT M184V alone ( 6 ).\n\nAs ISL and LEN act at different stages of the viral life cycle through\ndistinct inhibitory mechanisms, the two-drug combination could more\neffectively suppress viral breakthrough compared to the individual\ncompounds but could also result in the emergence of novel RAMs. *In\nvitro* resistance selection experiments showed that the combination of\nISL with LEN inhibited viral replication and breakthrough in wells at\nlower compound concentrations than that observed with either compound on\nits own. LEN and ISL maintained their independent pathways for the\ndevelopment of resistance, and no unexpected RAMs emerged in combination\nexperiments beyond what had been observed previously. When WT virus was\nused, mutations at RT M184 were the only ISL RAMs observed; M184I alone\nor as a mixture with wild-type M184 or M184V was observed ubiquitously\nin all wells with breakthrough at ISL concentrations at or greater than\nits IC ~50~ , whether LEN was present or not. When the M184I variant was\nused to initiate the resistance selection experiments, no additional ISL\nRAMs were detected, and M184I was maintained in all wells, suggesting\nthat the presence of M184I virus does not rapidly lead to the selection\nof additional ISL RAMs.\n\nIn LEN-only selection experiments, even though viral breakthrough was\nobserved in some wells with LEN concentrations as high as 64-fold over\nthe LEN IC ~50~ , most of the wells with \\<8-fold the LEN IC ~50~ did\nnot have any changes in CA. The most common change in CA that was\nobserved in the experiments initiated with WT virus was H87Q, which we\nhypothesized was likely a polymorphism present in the WT virus stock,\nbecause (i) it was present in selections with ISL or LEN alone or in\ncombination; (ii) it was observed as a mixture with WT H87 in all but a\nsingle well; (iii) it was only present in experiments initiated with WT\nvirus; and (iv) it was a common polymorphism in CA sequences cataloged\nin the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database ( 20 ).\nFurthermore, antiviral activity assays demonstrated that H87Q resulted\nin minimal reductions in susceptibility to ISL and LEN when present\nalone (2.6- and 1.5-fold, respectively) or in combination with other\nmutations encoding changes in CA (i.e., CA A14T/H87Q had reduced\nsusceptibility of 1.6- and 1.4-fold for ISL and LEN, respectively),\nconfirming the likelihood that H87Q is a CA polymorphism and not\nassociated with resistance.\n\nOutside of CA H87Q, there were CA changes in five wells in the LEN-only\nresistance selection experiment initiated with WT virus (T54TN/N74D in\none well and M66I in two wells at 32-fold of the LEN IC ~50~ , A14AT and\nQ67H in one well each at 16-fold of the LEN IC ~50~ ) and in seven wells\nin the experiment initiated with RT M184I virus (M66I in one well at\n64-fold and one well at 32-fold of the LEN IC ~50~ , N74D or N74ND in\nfive wells at 16- to 32-fold of the LEN IC ~50~ ). M66I, Q67H, and N74D\nhave previously been described, while T54N and A14T are novel. Antiviral\nassays of CA T54N or CA A14T did not reveal any alterations in\nsusceptibility that was \\>2-fold. However, the combination of T54N with\nN74D had an unexpected decrease in susceptibility to LEN (97.5-fold)\nthat would not have been predicted by the results from T54N (1.8-fold)\nor N74D (7.4-fold) alone. We evaluated the replicative ratio for the\nT54N, N74D, and T54N/N74D variants using the data from the\nmultiple-cycle antiviral assay. While T54N had a replicative ratio\nsimilar to WT, the replicative ratio of N74D and T54N/N74D were reduced\nby about 50% compared to WT.\n\nIn crystal structures of LEN bound to CA ( 5 , 21 ) and CA with the N74D\nmutation ( 22 ), T54 and N74/D74 are both located in the LEN-binding\nsite and separated by a distance of \\~20 Å ( Fig. 6 ). T54 is within 4 Å\nof the methylsulfonyl group of LEN, whereas N74/D74 is located within 4\nÅ from the chloro and sulfonamide groups of LEN. N74D has been\npreviously described to result in loss of a hydrogen bond and induced\nelectrostatic repulsion between CA and LEN ( 22 ) that causes LEN to\nmove slightly closer to T54 in the pocket. Although a crystal structure\nof CA with the T54N mutation has not been reported, we hypothesize that\nthe conformational shift of LEN bound to CA containing N74D is less\ntolerated when T54 is mutated to the larger asparagine side chain, thus\naccounting for the unexpected decrease in susceptibility to LEN in the\ncombined T54N/N74D mutant virus. In addition, out of \\~8,700 CA\nsequences from individuals in the Stanford Drug Resistance Database ( 20\n), there were only three occurrences of T54N and none in combination\nwith N74D. Therefore, the clinical relevance of T54N as an accessory\nmutation in CA is unknown.\n\nFig 6\n\nCrystal structure of LEN (gray) bound to CA (N74D) (green), PDB 7RJ4.\nView of the LEN-binding site in CA. The side chains of D74 and T54 are\nshown located at opposite ends of the binding pocket for LEN.\n\nThe key observations from the selection experiments are that the\ncombination of ISL with LEN not only resulted in reduced viral\nbreakthrough at higher multiples of each compound but also did not lead\nto the emergence of LEN RAMs. Altogether, the *in vitro* studies\nconducted here demonstrating additive antiviral activity, a lack of\nantagonism or cross-resistance, and a high barrier to the emergence of\nresistance suggest that ISL and LEN can make an effective two-drug\ncombination for the treatment of HIV-1.\n\n## DATA AVAILABILITY\n\nSequences from resistance selection experiments have been deposited in\nGenBank under accession numbers PP827803 -- PP828572 .\n\n### FEW SHOT EXAMPLES\n\nPMID: 35546110\nQuestion ID: 2\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\nEvidence: ISL was evaluated for its ability to prevent HIV-1 infection in MT4-GFP cells.

TAF is currently in phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Phase 1 and 2 studies have shown that TAF was associated with increased peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) drug loading and increased suppression of HIV-1 replication compared to treatment with TDF. In this study, selection of in vitro resistance to both TAF and the parent compound, TFV, led to the emergence of HIV-1 with the K65R amino acid substitution in RT with 6.5-fold-reduced susceptibility to TAF. Although TAF is more potent than TFV in vitro, the antiviral susceptibilities to TAF and TFV of a large panel of nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant mutants were highly correlated (R2 = 0.97), indicating that the two compounds have virtually the same resistance profile when assessed as fold change from the wild type. TAF showed full antiviral activity in PBMCs against primary HIV-1 isolates with protease inhibitor, nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), or integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance but reduced activity against isolates with extensive NRTI resistance amino acid substitutions. However, the increased cell loading of TFV with TAF versus TDF observed in vivo suggests that TAF may retain activity against TDF-resistant mutant viruses.\nRationale: The paper describes the resistance selection experiments conducted with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and tenofovir (TFV).

Although the primary H51Y substitution did not confer resistance against DTG or RAL (FC values of 1.25 and 0.98, respectively), consistent with previous results ( 11 ), the addition of R262K did result in low-level but significant biochemical resistance to DTG but not to RAL (FC values of 1.9 and 0.92, respectively).\"\nRationale: The paper includes in vitro drug susceptibility data, specifically examining the susceptibility of HIV-1 to dolutegravir (DTG) and raltegravir (RAL) using short-term resistance assays with TZM-bl cells.\nAnswer: Yes\n\nPMID: 26149983\nQuestion ID: 1\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\nEvidence: Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is an investigational prodrug of the HIV-1 nucleotide reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NtRTI) tenofovir (TFV), with improved potency and drug delivery properties over the current prodrug, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF).
