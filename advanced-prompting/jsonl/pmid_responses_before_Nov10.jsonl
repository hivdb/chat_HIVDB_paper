{"pmid": "37104815", "response": "```\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\n\nEvidence: The paper states that Sanger and ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) were performed on the HIV-1 genome. Resistance was retrospectively evaluated for participants with VF (pVL >50 copies/mL, confirmed within 4 weeks), numbering six and four in the 4/7 and 7/7 days groups, respectively, at failure in RNA samples (on the confirmed test), and at D0 in DNA samples.\n\nRationale: The evidence indicates that sequencing was performed on samples derived from participants in a clinical trial. Specifically, it discusses the sequencing of the HIV-1 genome and mentions participant details related to virological failure, which implies that patient-derived samples were indeed sequenced.\n\nAnswer: Yes\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\n\nEvidence: Resistance mutations related to current ART were detected more frequently by UDS. Among the 10 participants with VF, two showed resistant minority variants at D0, which could have favoured VF but without data on D0 UDS for persons without VF, the impact of baseline minority resistance-associated mutations cannot be fully assessed.\n\nRationale: The evidence refers to resistance mutations and how they relate to the treatment of participants based on in vitro sequencing results.

{"pmid": "37573167", "response": "```markdown\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\n\nEvidence: This retrospective study included 1126 HIV-1 drug-experienced virologically suppressed subjects with an available HIV-DNA GRT over the period 2010-2021 performed for routine clinical practice in several reference centers in Italy. HIV-1 DNA was obtained from whole-blood (N=180) or lymphomonocytic cells (N=936) after separation from peripheral blood from HIV-1-infected patients with a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient.\n\nRationale: The paper mentions that HIV-1 DNA was extracted from whole blood and lymphomonocytic cells ('PBMCs'), which indicates that genetic sequencing was performed on clinical samples from patients. Additionally, it includes a specific sample size of 1126 individuals, confirming the presence of patient-derived samples.\n\nAnswer: Yes.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\n\nEvidence: The study evaluates major resistance mutations (MRM), genotypic susceptibility score (GSS) for the current regimen, and the presence of APOBEC-related mutations. However, it primarily discusses the prevalence of resistance mutations and genotypic susceptibility rather than in vitro susceptibility assays or specific resistance testing methods like those mentioned.\n\nRationale: While resistance mutations are reported, there is no mention of phenotypic susceptibility testing, IC50 values, or drug susceptibility assays, which are necessary to classify the findings as in vitro drug susceptibility data.\n\nAnswer: No.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not mention any submission of sequences to databases like GenBank, nor does it provide any accession numbers or state that sequences are made publicly available.\n\nRationale: The absence of any reference to submission of

mentioned in any part of the text, there is no information to extract.\n\nAnswer: Not reported.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?\n\nEvidence: This retrospective study included 1126 HIV-1 drug-experienced virologically suppressed subjects with an available HIV-DNA GRT over the period 2010-2021.\n\nRationale: The paper specifies that it reports on 1126 individuals who underwent HIV-DNA genotypic resistance testing, clearly indicating the number of individuals sampled for sequencing.\n\nAnswer: 1126.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\nEvidence: This retrospective study was conducted in several reference centers in Italy.\n\nRationale: The paper explicitly identifies Italy as the location of the study and the source of the samples collected.\n\nAnswer: Italy.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\nEvidence: The samples were collected over the period 2010-2021 for routine clinical practice.\n\nRationale: The text specifies the years during which the samples were collected, allowing for the extraction of the year range.\n\nAnswer: 2010–2021.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The paper mentions Sanger sequencing performed as previously described, which involved extraction from PBMCs without indicating that amplicons were cloned.\n\nRationale: There are no terms in the methods that suggest cloning was performed, while phrases such as \"direct sequencing\" imply that the sequences were derived directly from the extracted DNA.\n\nAnswer: No.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?\n\nEvidence: The study evaluates major resistance mutations (MRM) in HIV-DNA, mentioning the presence of mutations in protease/reverse transcriptase (PR/RT) or integrase without specifying individual genes.\n\nRationale: The text indicates a focus on the pol region (associated with PR and RT) and mentions integrase as part of the analysis, but does not specify individual genes beyond the pol-related information.\n\nAnswer: Pol.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: What method was used for sequencing?\n\nEvidence: Sanger sequencing was performed as previously described. \n\nRationale: The paper explicitly mentions the use of Sanger sequencing as the method employed for genetic analysis, which corresponds to the description provided.\n\nAnswer: Sanger sequencing.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: What type of samples were sequenced?\n\nEvidence: HIV-1 DNA was obtained from whole-blood (N=180) or lymphomonocytic cells (N=936) after separation from peripheral blood from HIV-1-infected patients.\n\nRationale: The paper identifies that the samples for sequencing were obtained from whole blood and PBMCs, both of which are typical sample types in HIV genetic studies.\n\nAnswer: Whole blood, PBMC.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\n\nEvidence: The study included assessments of drug resistance in a population of individuals who were virologically suppressed, but does not explicitly state that samples were taken from those experiencing virological failure at the time of sampling.\n\nRationale: There is no indication that the subjects have experienced virological failure while on treatment, and since all subjects are reported to be virologically suppressed, it does not fit the criteria for individuals with virological failure.\n\nAnswer: No.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\n\nEvidence: The study does not mention that the patients were enrolled in clinical trials or provide any details about trial conditions.\n\nRationale: The absence of any references to clinical trials or trial registrations suggests that this was a non-trial observational study rather than one conducted under clinical trial conditions.\n\nAnswer: No.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?\n\nEvidence: The paper specifies that it included 1126 HIV-1 drug-experienced individuals as participants.\n\nRationale: The use of the term \"drug-experienced\" directly indicates that the participants had previously received antiretroviral drugs, therefore satisfying the criteria.\n\nAnswer: Yes.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The study mentions that individuals were \"drug-experienced,\" and that 44.3% had previously received a regimen containing an INSTI, and over half were under triple therapy.\n\nRationale: Since the participants are identified as experienced with ARVs, it implies that they have been exposed to various classes, predominantly NRTIs and others as indicated.\n\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI, INSTI.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The paper mentions that a substantial proportion of patients were on a triple therapy regimen, which typically includes two NRTIs combined with either an NNRTI or a PI/INSTI.\n\nRationale: While specific drug names are not mentioned, the classification of treatment as \"triple therapy\" along with discussions of drug categories (like INSTI) implies that these were received before sequencing.\n\nAnswer: Not reported.\n```"}
