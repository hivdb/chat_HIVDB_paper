reported\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?\n\nEvidence: \"The virus strain was isolated in 2007 from a patient who was diagnosed in the same year and was without treatment history.\"\n\nRationale: The paper provides information regarding one specific virus strain linked to an individual but does not report multiple individuals as part of the sequencing process.\n\nAnswer: 1\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\nEvidence: \"A virus strain (2007CNGX-HK) of CRF08_BC was originally isolated from

confirmed by DNA sequencing.\"\n\nRationale: The paper mentions DNA sequencing but does not specify the sequencing technique used (e.g., Sanger, Next-Generation).\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: What type of samples were sequenced?\n\nEvidence: \"Viral strains were obtained and subsequently analyzed.\"\n\nRationale: The paper discusses strains and mutations derived from viral culture, indicating that the type of sample is primarily viral isolates rather than directly from blood or plasma.\n\nAnswer: Virus isolates\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\n\nEvidence: \"The combination of D404N or H221Y with Y181C did not influence viral susceptibility to

mean age was 15 (±3) years; and median [IQR] duration on ART was 51 [46--60] months.\"\n\nRationale: The report cites that 141 participants with virological failure were enrolled and had their samples sequenced.\n\nAnswer: 141\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\nEvidence: \"A cohort study was conducted from 2018--2020 among 311 adolescents living with perinatally acquired HIV (APHI) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Cameroon.\"\n\nRationale: The study focuses on participants in Cameroon, revealing the location from where the sequenced samples were obtained.\n\nAnswer: Cameroon\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\nEvidence: \"A cohort study was conducted from 2018--2020 among 311 adolescents living with perinatally acquired HIV (APHI) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Cameroon.\"\n\nRationale: The timeframe for the study, encompassing 2018 to 2020, indicates the years when the sequenced samples were collected.\n\nAnswer: 2018-2020\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?\n\nEvidence: \"Following enrolment, ten mL of whole blood were collected from each participant ... the protease and reverse-transcriptase regions in the pol gene fragment (~1600 base pairs) were used for sequencing.\"\n\nRationale: The methods section describes the process for obtaining sequences but does not mention any cloning of samples. \n\nAnswer: No\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?\n\nEvidence: \"Sequencing of protease and reverse transcriptase regions was performed for participants experiencing virological failure...\"\n\nRationale: The statement clearly identifies that the paper reports on the sequencing of the protease and reverse transcriptase regions of the HIV genome.\n\nAnswer: PR, RT\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: What method was used for sequencing?\n\nEvidence: \"PCR products were sequenced using the Applied Biosystems 3500 genetic analyzer...\" \n\nRationale: The paper mentions using the Applied Biosystems 3500 genetic analyzer, which is indicative of Sanger sequencing.\n\nAnswer: Sanger sequencing\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: What type of samples were sequenced?\n\nEvidence: \"Blood were collected from each participant... plasma aliquots (for PVL and HIV genotypic resistance testing, GRT) were obtained after centrifugation.\"\n\nRationale: The paper specifies that plasma samples were collected for genotypic resistance testing, indicating that plasma was the type of sample sequenced.\n\nAnswer: Plasma\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\n\nEvidence: \"Sequencing of protease and reverse transcriptase regions was performed for participants experiencing virological failure, VF, (Plasma viral load, PVL ≥ 1000 RNA copies/ml).\"\n\nRationale: The study specifically reports sequencing performed on participants with virological failure, outlining that sequences obtained were from individuals experiencing this condition.\n\nAnswer: Yes\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\n\nEvidence: \"A cohort study was conducted from 2018--2020 among 311 adolescents living with perinatally acquired HIV (APHI) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART)...\"\n\nRationale: The study is described as a cohort study rather than a clinical trial. It does not state randomization or any trial specifics.\n\nAnswer: No\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?\n\nEvidence: \"The study population consisted of children who initiated PI-based ART...and had a genotypic HIV-1 drug resistance test done.\"\n\nRationale: The text indicates that the study includes patients who have been on antiretroviral therapy, meaning their sequences were derived from individuals who had previously received ARVs.\n\nAnswer: Yes\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: \"The majority of the children (64.6%) were initiated on a combination of d4T, lamivudine (3TC), and LPV/r...while some children were switched to NNRTI-based regimens...\"\n\nRationale: The study provides detailed accounts of the specific drug combinations received, indicating multiple drug classes were utilized prior to sample sequencing.\n\nAnswer: NRTI, PI, NNRTI\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: \"The majority were still on d4T (76.9%) and 3TC (90.8%), while 13.8% were now on ABC, 10.8% on didanosine (ddI) and 7.7% on zidovudine (AZT).\"\n\nRationale: The paper lists specific drugs (d4T, 3TC, ABC, didanosine, and zidovudine) that were received by individuals before sample sequencing.\n\nAnswer: Stavudine (d4T), Lamivudine (3TC), Abacavir (ABC), Didanosine (ddI), Zidovudine (AZT)\n```"}
