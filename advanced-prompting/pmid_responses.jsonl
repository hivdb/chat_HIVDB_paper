PCR amplicons were purified with illustra TM ExoProStar TM (Cytiva) and sequenced by Macrogen Inc.\n\nRationale: The methodology describes the process of PCR amplification of the viral RNA and purification of those amplicons, but it does not mention any cloning steps prior to sequencing. No explicit cloning techniques are referenced.\n\nAnswer: No\n\n\nQuestion: Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?\n\nEvidence: HIV-1 pol sequences (46PR/45RT/67IN) were recovered from 67 (88.2%) of 76 children/adolescents. PR, RT and IN nucleotide sequences were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm implemented in MEGA6 to characterize HIV-1 variants.\n\nRationale: The paper indicates that the sequenced regions include PR (protease), RT (reverse transcriptase), and IN (integrase), specifying that the HIV-1 pol region was targeted during the sequencing.\n\nAnswer: PR, RT, IN\n\n\nQuestion: What method was used for sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The extracted RNA was amplified by RT–PCR and nested PCR to obtain the HIV-1 pol region. The sequences were sequenced by Macrogen Inc. using standard sequencing techniques.\n\nRationale: The methodology mentions RT-PCR to amplify the pol region and indicates that the sequencing was conducted by a sequencing company, which is likely using established sequencing methods, although it does not specify between Sanger or NGS.\n\nAnswer: Not Reported\n\n\nQuestion: What type of samples were sequenced?\n\nEvidence: Plasma samples from 76 HIV-positive naive or ART-treated children and adolescents with therapeutic failure under clinical follow-up at this hospital were collected during 2018--19. The extracted RNA was amplified by RT–PCR and nested PCR to obtain the HIV-1 pol region.\n\nRationale: The evidence clearly indicates that plasma samples were used for the sequencing, as the extracted RNA was sourced from this type of sample. \n\nAnswer: Plasma\n\n\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\n\nEvidence: Among the treated patients, 34 (54.8%) carried resistant strains, with major DRMs to one (40.3%), two (9.7%) or three (4.8%) ARV families. All 62 children/adolescents treated with pol sequence had received NRTIs, 45.2% non-NRTIs, 95.2% PIs and only 11 (17.7%) INSTIs.\n\nRationale: The text states that all treated children/adolescents under the study exhibited virological failure (VL >50 copies/mL), confirming that sequenced samples were obtained from individuals with treatment failure.\n\nAnswer: Yes\n\n\nQuestion: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not describe if the study participants were part of a randomized or controlled clinical trial. It presents a cohort study focused on resistance patterns among HIV-infected children and adolescents in Panama.\n\nRationale: The study is described as observational and focuses on a specific cohort of patients monitoring clinical outcomes and drug resistance without mentioning any clinical trials or designs that would indicate randomized control or clinical interventions. \n\nAnswer: No\n\n\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?\n\nEvidence: Five were ART-naive and 62 ART-treated under virological failure. The majority of the treatment-experienced group carried resistance mutations to various classes of ARV drugs.\n\nRationale: It is clearly stated that there were 62 ART-treated individuals who were experiencing virological failure, indicating that they had previously received ARV drugs, confirming their experience with antiretrovirals.\n\nAnswer: Yes\n\n\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: All 71 treated children/adolescents had received NRTIs, 45.1% NNRTIs, 95.8% PIs and just 11 (15.5%) patients were INSTI-experienced.\n\nRationale: The text indicates that patients received multiple classes of antiretroviral drugs prior to sampling. Given that all 71 subjects had received NRTIs and a significant number had also been exposed to NNRTIs, PIs, and some to INSTIs, it clearly outlines the drug class exposure of these individuals.\n\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI, INSTI\n\n\nQuestion: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: Most treated children (98.6%) had received lamivudine + zidovudine, followed by lopinavir / ritonavir (95.8%) and efavirenz (45.1%).\n\nRationale: The drug administration details specify that the majority of the treated individuals received lamivudine combined with zidovudine, while others also took lopinavir/ritonavir and efavirenz. This provides a clear indication of the particular drugs received by individuals prior to sequencing.\n\nAnswer: Lamivudine, Zidovudine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Efavirenz\n```"}

paper discusses participant enrollment and outcomes, revealing a total of 1,045 participants, with specific numbers for each treatment arm but does not mention the number of individuals whose samples were sequenced.\n\n**Rationale:** While it provides details on participant numbers involved in a clinical study, it fails to specify how many had samples obtained specifically for sequencing, thus falling short of meeting the criteria.\n\n**Answer:** Not reported\n\n---\n\n### Question 6: From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\n**Evidence:** The paper does not specify individual countries regarding sample collection locations for sequencing.\n\n**Rationale:** Without any reference to specific country participation or sample collection origins, this question cannot be answered.\n\n**Answer:** Not reported\n\n---\n\n### Question 7: From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\n**Evidence:** There is no mention of specific years or timeframes associated with sample collection for sequencing purposes in the document.\n\n**Rationale:** The paper does not provide any details about the calendar years or periods during which samples were collected, hence the answer must be based on the absence of such data.\n\n**Answer:** Not reported\n\n---\n\n### Question 8: Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?\n\n**Evidence:** The paper does not discuss cloning of samples or give any information on whether PCR products were cloned before sequencing.\n\n**Rationale:** The absence of specific references to cloning techniques or processes pointed out in the questions means there is no information to confirm that cloning prior to sequencing occurred.\n\n**Answer:** Not applicable\n\n---\n\n### Question 9: Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?\n\n**Evidence:** The paper mainly reports on the therapeutic regimen’s efficacy and safety but does not include any specific details about any sequenced HIV genes or regions.\n\n**Rationale:** Due to a lack of information in the text concerning HIV genes sequenced, this question cannot be adequately answered with supporting evidence.\n\n**Answer:** Not applicable\n\n---\n\n### Question 10: What method was used for sequencing?\n\n**Evidence:** The paper focuses on treatment outcomes without mentioning any specific sequencing methods used.\n\n**Rationale:** Since the methodology for sequencing is not discussed or referred to anywhere in the document, there is no basis to conclude which method was employed.\n\n**Answer:** Not applicable\n\n---\n\n### Question 11: What type of samples were sequenced?\n\n**Evidence:** The document discusses participant treatments using intramuscular CAB and RPV but does not mention types of samples specifically sequenced.\n\n**Rationale:** Without any clear mention of the samples (plasma, PBMC, etc.) involved in sequencing processes, it cannot provide the requested type of samples.\n\n**Answer:** Not reported\n\n---\n\n### Question 12: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\n\n**Evidence:** The study indicates some participants experienced confirmed virologic failure but refrains from stating that sequencing was performed on these specific cases.\n\n**Rationale:** While there are mentions of virologic failure, the paper does not explicitly correlate these failures with sequencing results or provide details of whether such sequences were derived from individuals experiencing treatment failure.\n\n**Answer:** Not applicable \n\n---\n\n### Question 13: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\n\n**Evidence:** The study identifies itself as a phase 3b trial assessing the efficacy and safety of CAB+RPV as a long-acting regimen, confirming a clinical trial setting.\n\n**Rationale:** The structured design involving randomized assignments and specific treatment arms clearly indicates that patients were involved in a clinical trial.\n\n**Answer:** Yes\n\n---\n\n### Question 14: Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?\n\n**Evidence:** The paper mentions prior exposure to CAB and RPV in a portion of the study participants.\n\n**Rationale:** Given the discussion of previously treated individuals among the participants, it indicates that some subjects had received ARV therapy prior to sample collection.\n\n**Answer:** Yes\n\n---\n\n### Question 15: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\n**Evidence:** The study mentions that participants had previous exposure to CAB and RPV, implying the usage of these specific drug classes.\n\n**Rationale:** Since data regarding previous antiretroviral drug exposure is provided, this gives enough evidence to infer the presence of the respective drug classes; however, specific drug class details step out of the scope of the content reported.\n\n**Answer:** ART-experienced (CAB, RPV)\n\n---\n\n### Question 16: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\n**Evidence:** Participants were treated with long-acting CAB and RPV, but details about other specific drugs or regimens previously taken by all individuals were not provided.\n\n**Rationale:** While it is clear that individuals received CAB and RPV, there are no detailed reports on the complete list of drugs administered to them prior to sequencing, making it challenging to provide a comprehensive answer.\n\n**Answer:** CAB, RPV"}

{"pmid": "36779485", "response": "Sure! Here are the formatted responses based on the provided information:\n\n```\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\n\nEvidence: Genotypic sequence data from 277 patients initiating ART and 1372 patients experiencing NNRTI-treatment failure were included for analysis. One in 10 treatment-naive patients and 74.5% of patients failing treatment presented with rilpivirine DRMs.\n\nRationale: The paper explicitly mentions \"genotypic sequence data from patients,\" indicating that the sequences were obtained from actual patient samples rather than laboratory strains. It also identifies both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients as the source of these sequences.\n\nAnswer: Yes\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\n\nEvidence: Our retrospective analysis indicates that rilpivirine DRMs are common in a setting wherein NNRTI-based treatment was recently widely implemented. The presence of rilpivirine drug resistance mutations (DRMs) are a risk factor for virological failure in patients treated with long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine (CAB/RPV LA).\n\nRationale: The discussion of rilpivirine DRMs indicates a focus on drug resistance rather than on in vitro susceptibility data. The paper does not report specific susceptibility testing, IC50 values, or other metrics that would confirm in vitro drug susceptibility data.\n\nAnswer: No\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not provide any information regarding the deposition of sequences into databases like GenBank, nor does it mention accession numbers or deposits.\n\nRationale: Since there is no mention of sequences being submitted or deposited into public repositories, it can be concluded that the sequences from the study are not publicly available.\n\nAnswer: No\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not report any GenBank accession numbers or any other details regarding sequence deposition.\n\nRationale: Since the previous question indicated that sequences were not made publicly available, no accession numbers can be extracted.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?\n\nEvidence: Genotypic sequence data from 277 patients initiating ART and 1372 patients experiencing NNRTI-treatment failure were included for analysis.\n\nRationale: The total number of samples taken from patients can be summed up (277 + 1372 = 1649), but since this includes both treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced, the number of individuals classified as sources for genotypic resistance testing should be regarded individually in the study.\n\nAnswer: 1649\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\nEvidence: The sequences were obtained from a South African cohort. \n\nRationale: The text directly states the location of the patient samples as being part of a cohort based in South Africa.\n\nAnswer: South Africa\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not mention any specific years in which samples were collected.\n\nRationale: Since no year range or specific years are indicated in the content provided, it is unclear when the sequencing took place.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The paper states that the presence of rilpivirine drug resistance mutations (DRMs) are a risk factor for virological failure but does not mention cloning procedures for samples.\n\nRationale: There are no specific references to techniques that involve cloning, such as “amplicons were cloned,” indicating that the sequencing may have been done directly.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?\n\nEvidence: The paper mentions the presence of rilpivirine drug resistance mutations, but it does not specify particular HIV genes or regions that were sequenced.\n\nRationale: Since no specific genes or regions (like pol, env, gag, etc.) were mentioned in the context of sequencing, the information is insufficient to determine which genes were sequenced.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: What method was used for sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not directly mention the sequencing method used.\n\nRationale: There is no information provided about the sequencing techniques employed, such as whether it was Sanger or NGS, leading to uncertainty about the method.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: What type of samples were sequenced?\n\nEvidence: Genotypic sequence data from 277 patients initiating ART and 1372 patients experiencing NNRTI-treatment failure were included for analysis.\n\nRationale: The description suggests that the samples were drawn from patient cohorts, but specific types (e.g., plasma, PBMC) are not explicitly mentioned.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\n\nEvidence: 74.5% of patients failing treatment presented with rilpivirine DRMs. \n\nRationale: The mention of \"patients failing treatment\" indicates that sequences were indeed obtained from individuals who experienced virological failure.\n\nAnswer: Yes\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\n\nEvidence: The study does not provide any statements indicating that the patients were part of clinical trials.\n\nRationale: Since the article primarily discusses cohort data without any references to clinical trials, it is reasonable to conclude that the patients were not involved in such studies.\n\nAnswer: No\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?\n\nEvidence: One in 10 treatment-naive patients and 74.5% of patients failing treatment presented with rilpivirine DRMs.\n\nRationale: The presence of treatment-naive patients signifies not all individuals had received ARV drugs, but a significant portion of those failing treatment did have prior exposure to ARVs.\n\nAnswer: Yes\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not provide specific information regarding the ARV drug classes received by the individuals.\n\nRationale: Without explicit mention of drug classes or specific drugs administered prior to sequencing, the details cannot be extracted or inferred.\n\nAnswer: Not reported\n```\n\n```\nQuestion: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The paper does not detail the specific drugs received by the individuals.\n\nRationale: Since there is no information regarding individual drug administration prior to the sequencing, it is not possible to provide the drug names.\n\nAnswer: Not applicable\n``` \n\nThis structure summarizes each question raised, backed by evidence, rationale, and the conclusion drawn in regard to each query based on the contents provided."}

{"pmid": "36982978", "response": "Sure! Below are the formatted answers to each of the questions based on the provided paper content.\n\n### Question 1: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\n\nEvidence: Currently, it is estimated that 1--2 million people worldwide are infected with HIV-2, accounting for 3--5% of the global burden of HIV. Antiretroviral drugs in clinical use were designed for HIV-1 and, unfortunately, some do not work as well, or do not work at all, for HIV-2. We also review HIV-2 drug resistance mutations and resistance pathways that develop in HIV-2-infected patients under treatment.\n\nRationale: The paper discusses HIV-2 infection but does not provide any evidence that it reports on sequences obtained from patient samples, as it appears to focus on discussing treatment and mechanisms without stating specific patient-derived sequence data.\n\nAnswer: No\n\n---\n\n### Question 2: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\n\nEvidence: This is the case for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide (T-20), most protease inhibitors (PIs), the attachment inhibitor fostemsavir and most broadly neutralizing antibodies. However, rapid emergence of drug resistance and cross-resistance within each drug class dramatically reduces second-line treatment options.
