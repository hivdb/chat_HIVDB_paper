## Study Objectives
The objective of this study is to systematically extract and curate data related to HIV drug resistance. Specifically, the study aims to identify and compile information from published reports that include:

1. HIV sequences obtained from patient samples, including their corresponding GenBank accession numbers.
2. The demographics of the populations undergoing HIV sequencing
3. Details on the samples and sequencing methods used to generate these sequences.
4. Antiretroviral treatment histories of the persons undergoing HIV sequencing.

## Questions

Question 1: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?
Question 2: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?
Question 3: Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?
Question 4: What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?
Question 5: How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?
Question 6: From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?
Question 7: From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?
Question 8: Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?
Question 9: Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?
Question 10: What method was used for sequencing?
Question 11: What type of samples were sequenced?
Question 12: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?
Question 13: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?
Question 14: Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?
Question 15: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?
Question 16: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?

## For each question:

Step 1: get the question, store as "question".
Step 2: extract two or three sentences from the "paper content" that can be used to answer the question, separate them using '.', store as 'evidence'.
Step 3: provide the rationale about how you found the answer from the content in details, store as 'rationale'.
Step 4: answer the question, store as 'answer'.
Step 5: format your answer in the format:

"""
Question: <question>

Evidence: <evidence>

Rationale: <rationale>

Answer: <answer>
"""

Make sure you answer all the questions.
