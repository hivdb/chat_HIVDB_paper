Recombinant integrase proteins were expressed, and purified and biochemical assays of strand transfer efficiency as well as viral infectivity and drug resistance studies were performed.","The methods describe site-directed mutagenesis of the NL4.3 laboratory backbone, expression of recombinant integrase in bacteria, and generation of viral clones via transfection of pNL4.3 plasmids in 293T cells. There is no description of obtaining or sequencing viral material from patient-derived clinical samples, so the study did not report patient HIV sequences."
26246578,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,Yes.,"HIV susceptibilities to DTG, RAL, and EVG were measured by the infection of 30,000 TZM-bl cells using 100,000 RT units per well of each virus in the presence of 1:10 serial dilutions of drugs. Figure 3 displays the results of resistance assays in tissue culture with the various drugs used in this study, i.e., DTG, RAL, and EVG.","The paper describes cell-based infection assays in TZM-bl cells with serial dilutions of integrase inhibitors and reports IC50 values and dose-response curves (Figure 3 and Table 3), which are standard in vitro drug susceptibility measurements. Therefore in vitro susceptibility data are reported."
26246578,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No (not reported).,"The generation of the construct bearing the N155H/R263K mutations has been described already (10). This manuscript details biochemical assays, recombinant protein expression, and generation of NL4.3 viral clones but does not provide GenBank accession numbers or state that sequences were deposited.","The text contains no mention of depositing nucleotide or protein sequences in public databases (e.g., GenBank) and provides no accession numbers. The study focuses on engineered NL4.3 constructs and biochemical/virological assays rather than reporting novel patient-derived sequences, so no public sequence deposition is reported."
26246578,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,"There is no mention of GenBank accession numbers or sequence deposition in the methods, results, or acknowledgments. The paper describes site-directed mutagenesis of NL4.3 constructs and recombinant protein expression but does not list any accession numbers.","Because the manuscript does not report patient-derived sequences or any sequence submission statements and provides no accession identifiers, there are no GenBank accession numbers to report."
26246578,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Zero — no individuals sampled.,"Genetically homogenous viral stocks were produced as described previously; briefly, 293T cells were transfected with the various pNL4.3 plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000. Recombinant integrase proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) bacterial cells and purified as previously published.","All experimental material was generated from laboratory plasmids, recombinant protein expression in bacteria, and transfection of cell lines. There is no description of collecting samples from human participants or sequencing patient-derived viruses, so no individuals were sampled."
26246578,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable — no patient-derived samples or sequences were obtained.,"The study describes work with NL4.3 laboratory HIV-1 vectors, recombinant integrase proteins, and viruses produced in 293T cells. There is no description of clinical sample collection or geographic origins of clinical isolates.","Because the paper did not include patient-derived sequences or samples, there are no countries of origin to report."
26246578,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable — no samples from patients were sequenced.,"The manuscript details engineered constructs, recombinant protein expression, and cell-culture-based assays rather than sequencing of clinical samples. No sampling dates or collection years are provided.","No patient or clinical sequences were reported, so there are no collection years to report."
26246578,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not applicable for patient samples; laboratory plasmid constructs and viral clones were generated by cloning for experiments.,"The generation of the pNL4.3 ~IN(N155H/R263K)~ plasmid has been reported previously and similar methods were used to generate other pNL4.3IN (mutant) plasmids through site-directed mutagenesis. Genetically homogenous viral stocks were produced as described previously; briefly, 293T cells were transfected with the various pNL4.3 plasmids.","While the study used molecular cloning to create mutant pNL4.3 plasmids and produced viral clones in cell culture, there were no patient-derived samples to clone prior to sequencing. Thus, cloning was performed on laboratory constructs but not on clinical samples for sequencing."
26246578,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,No sequencing of HIV genes from patient samples was reported; the study investigated the integrase (IN) gene by engineered mutagenesis and expression.,"Site-directed mutagenesis was performed... to introduce the secondary mutations L74M, E92Q, T97A, E157Q, and G163R into the pET15b N155H/R263K integrase subtype B expression vectors. Recombinant integrase proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) bacterial cells and purified as previously published.","The focus of the work is on integrase (IN) mutations introduced into laboratory constructs and on recombinant integrase proteins; no sequencing of HIV genes from clinical samples is described. Therefore integrase is the gene studied, but it was manipulated rather than sequenced from patients."
26246578,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not applicable — the paper does not describe performing sequencing of HIV samples.,"The methods describe site-directed mutagenesis, recombinant protein expression, strand transfer assays, and cell-based infectivity and resistance assays.

Recombinant integrase proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) bacterial cells and purified as previously published.","The paper used laboratory-generated plasmids, bacterial expression systems, and viruses produced in cell culture rather than sequencing biological samples from patients, so there were no sequenced sample types to report."
26246578,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No — the study did not obtain or report sequences from individuals, including those with virological failure.","The experiments involved NL4.3 HIV-1 vectors with engineered mutations and recombinant integrase proteins, and assays were performed in TZM-bl and 293T cells. Background discussion references patients failing RAL/EVG conceptually, but no patient-derived sequences are presented in this study.","Although clinical context and prior reports about patients failing integrase inhibitors are discussed, the experimental data derive from engineered laboratory viruses and recombinant proteins; no sequences from treatment-failing individuals were obtained or analyzed in this paper."
26246578,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No — there were no patients in this study.,"The methods and experiments describe in vitro biochemical assays, recombinant protein expression, and cell-culture infectivity and resistance assays using laboratory constructs and cell lines. The paper references clinical trials/studies in the discussion (e.g., P1093 and SAILING) but does not enroll patients itself.",The study is laboratory-based and did not include human participants or clinical trial enrollment; clinical trials are only cited in the discussion for context.
26246578,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"No — the paper does not report sequences from individuals, regardless of treatment history.","This manuscript details generation of mutant NL4.3 constructs, recombinant integrase expression, and in vitro assays of infectivity and drug susceptibility. The discussion mentions that N155H has been associated with DTG failure in treatment-experienced patients in prior reports, but such patient sequences are not presented here.","Although the authors discuss findings from treatment-experienced patients in the literature, the experiments reported are based on engineered laboratory viruses and recombinant proteins and do not include or report sequences from ARV-experienced individuals."
26246578,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not applicable — no individuals or patient samples were included in this study; the drugs used in the experiments were integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs: dolutegravir, raltegravir, elvitegravir).","Merck & Co., Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., and ViiV Healthcare, Ltd., supplied raltegravir, elvitegravir, and dolutegravir, respectively. HIV susceptibilities to DTG, RAL, and EVG were measured by the infection of TZM-bl cells in the presence of serial dilutions of drugs.","Because there were no patient samples, there is no information on drug exposures of individuals; however, the experimental drugs used in vitro belong to the integrase inhibitor class."
26246578,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not applicable — no individuals were sampled; experimentally the study used dolutegravir (DTG), raltegravir (RAL), and elvitegravir (EVG).","Merck & Co., Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., and ViiV Healthcare, Ltd., supplied raltegravir, elvitegravir, and dolutegravir, respectively. HIV susceptibilities to DTG, RAL, and EVG were measured by infection of TZM-bl cells in the presence of serial dilutions of drugs.","There are no patient treatment histories reported because no patient-derived sequences were analyzed. The manuscript does, however, report experiments testing susceptibility to the three INSTIs DTG, RAL, and EVG."
26311878,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,No. The study used lab-derived plasmids and viruses and sequenced PCR products from tissue-culture samples rather than patient-derived clinical samples.,Viral RNA was extracted from the aliquots by using an RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) and amplified by RT-PCR (Life Technologies). The PCR products were then sequenced to detect the emergence of drug resistance mutations. All plasmids were verified by sequencing.,"The methods describe sequencing of PCR products derived from culture fluids (tissue-culture selections in CBMCs) and verification of plasmids produced by site-directed mutagenesis; there is no description of obtaining or sequencing HIV RNA or DNA from patient clinical specimens. Therefore sequences reported derive from laboratory constructs and culture selections, not patient samples."
26311878,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,"Yes. The paper reports in vitro susceptibility (IC50) data for DTG, RAL, and EVG using cell-based assays.","Susceptibilities of virus to ARVs were measured by the addition of serially diluted DTG, RAL, or EVG to TZM-bl cells prior to infection with the viruses described above. Luciferase levels were measured after 48 h of incubation, similar to the protocol for the infectivity assay described above, and 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) were determined. Resistance assays ... to determine the effects of the T66I substitution combined with the R263K and/or the E138K secondary substitution on resistance to each of the drugs DTG, RAL, and EVG (Table 4).","The methods explicitly describe cell-based inhibition assays in TZM-bl cells with serial dilutions of integrase inhibitors and the determination of IC50 values, and the results reference fold-changes in IC50 (Table 4). This constitutes in vitro drug susceptibility data."
26311878,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No. The paper does not report deposition of sequences to public databases or provide accession numbers.,All plasmids were verified by sequencing. The PCR products were then sequenced to detect the emergence of drug resistance mutations. (No GenBank accession numbers or statements of sequence deposition are provided in the text.),"While the manuscript describes sequencing of plasmids and PCR products, it does not include any GenBank accession numbers or state that sequences were deposited in public repositories. Therefore sequences were not reported as made publicly available in this paper."
26311878,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,All plasmids were verified by sequencing. The PCR products were then sequenced to detect the emergence of drug resistance mutations. (The manuscript does not list any GenBank accession numbers.),The paper contains no GenBank accession numbers or similar identifiers for sequences; only internal sequencing for plasmid verification and culture-derived PCR products is described. Thus no accession numbers are provided.

No human patient samples were sequenced in this study.,"Cord blood was obtained from the Department of Obstetrics, Jewish General Hospital, Montréal, Canada. Viral RNA was extracted from the aliquots by using an RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) and amplified by RT-PCR. The study generated plasmids by site-directed mutagenesis and produced viruses by transfection of HEK 293T cells.",The methods describe use of cord-blood-derived CBMCs for culture and laboratory construction of mutant viruses from plasmids; there is no description of collecting or sequencing samples from human patients. Therefore no individual patient samples were sequenced.
26311878,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Not applicable for patient-derived samples; cord blood was obtained in Montréal, Canada. The sequenced material was laboratory-derived (NL4-3 plasmids/viruses) rather than clinical samples from countries.","Cord blood was obtained from the Department of Obstetrics, Jewish General Hospital, Montréal, Canada. The production of plasmids pNL4-3 IN(R263K) and pNL4-3 IN(E138K/R263K) was reported previously. To produce replication-competent genetically homogenous viruses, 12.5 μg of plasmid ... was used to transfect HEK 293T cells.","No patient clinical samples from specific countries were sequenced; the only human material mentioned is cord blood obtained in Montréal used for primary cell cultures. The sequences described originate from lab-generated NL4-3 plasmids/viruses, so a country of origin for patient samples is not applicable."
26311878,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable / not reported. The paper does not provide years for any sequenced samples because sequences derive from laboratory constructs and culture selections.,Viral RNA was extracted from the aliquots by using an RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) and amplified by RT-PCR (Life Technologies). The PCR products were then sequenced to detect the emergence of drug resistance mutations. (No sampling years or dates are reported for sequences.),"The methods describe experimental procedures but do not include collection dates or years for sequenced material. Because the work used laboratory-generated viruses and culture selections rather than dated clinical specimens, no years of sample collection are reported."
26311878,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,"For the constructs used, yes: plasmids were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and verified by sequencing; clinical sample cloning was not performed because no patient samples were used.","pNL4-3 IN(T66I), pNL4-3 IN(R263K), pNL4-3 IN(T66I/R263K), and pNL4-3 IN(T66I/E138K/R263K) were produced by using site-directed mutagenesis. All plasmids were verified by sequencing. To produce replication-competent genetically homogenous viruses, 12.5 μg of plasmid ... was used to transfect HEK 293T cells.",The authors created cloned plasmid constructs carrying specific integrase mutations via site-directed mutagenesis and verified those plasmids by sequencing prior to producing virus stocks. There is no indication of cloning clinical amplicons from patient samples because none were used.
26311878,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,Integrase (the integrase coding region of pol) was the sequenced region examined for mutations.,The R263K substitution in integrase has been selected in tissue culture with dolutegravir (DTG) ... The primers used for T66I mutagenesis were ... All plasmids were verified by sequencing. Viral RNA was extracted from the aliquots ... and amplified by RT-PCR ... The PCR products were then sequenced to detect the emergence of drug resistance mutations.,"Throughout the paper the focus is on integrase substitutions (T66I, R263K, E138K) and plasmids are named pNL4-3 IN(...), indicating sequencing targeted the integrase coding region. The sequencing described was used to detect integrase resistance mutations."

The PCR products were then sequenced to detect the emergence of drug resistance mutations. All plasmids were verified by sequencing.,"The methods state that viral RNA was amplified by RT-PCR and PCR products were sequenced, and that plasmids were verified by sequencing, but they do not specify the sequencing platform or Sanger versus next-generation sequencing. Therefore the described method is RT-PCR/PCR followed by unspecified sequencing."
26311878,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,PCR products derived from viral RNA from culture supernatants (tissue-culture selections in CBMCs) and plasmid DNA constructs were sequenced.,CBMCs were infected ... and aliquots of culture fluids were collected weekly.

26311878,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No. The sequences reported were from laboratory constructs and tissue-culture selections, not from individuals experiencing virological failure.","Tissue culture selections with RAL or EVG. CBMCs were infected with NL4.3 virus ... Viral RNA was extracted from the aliquots ... and amplified by RT-PCR ... The PCR products were then sequenced to detect the emergence of drug resistance mutations. The T66I substitution was originally described ... in viruses isolated from individuals failing EVG treatment (citation), but that refers to prior studies.","While the discussion references prior reports of T66I in viruses from patients failing EVG, this particular study used in vitro selections and lab-generated viruses; no patient-derived samples from individuals with virological failure were sequenced here."
26311878,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No. There were no patients in this study and no clinical trial involvement.,"Cord blood was obtained from the Department of Obstetrics, Jewish General Hospital, Montréal, Canada. CBMCs were infected with NL4.3 virus ... All experiments describe cell lines, primary cord-blood cells, plasmids, and tissue-culture selections.","The study is an in vitro laboratory investigation using cell lines, primary cord-blood mononuclear cells, and recombinant viruses; no patients or clinical trial participants were enrolled or described."

All clones were sequenced across the entire genome to ensure that no extraneous mutations occurred during the mutagenesis process.","The methods describe use of established laboratory molecular clones (pNL4-3 and pROD9) and site-directed mutagenesis to generate mutant clones; sequencing was performed on those engineered clones. There is no mention of collecting or sequencing viruses from clinical/patient samples, so no patient-derived sequences were reported."
26559830,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,Yes — the paper reports in vitro phenotypic protease inhibitor (PI) susceptibility data (EC50s) using single-cycle cell culture assays.,"The susceptibilities of each wild-type or mutant HIV-2 molecular clone were determined using a single-cycle assay as described previously. Fifty percent effective concentrations (EC50s) were obtained from at least three sets of dose-response data using sigmoidal regression, log10 transformed, and tested for statistically significant differences by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Sidak's test for multiple comparisons.","The Results and Methods sections describe single-cycle culture-based assays comparing EC50 values for wild-type and mutant viruses across nine FDA-approved PIs, with statistical analysis of EC50s. This is direct in vitro drug susceptibility testing."
26559830,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No — the paper does not report public deposition of sequences (no GenBank accession numbers); only that clones were sequenced and that primer sequences are available on request.,All clones were sequenced across the entire genome to ensure that no extraneous mutations occurred during the mutagenesis process. Nucleotide sequences of the mutagenic primers are available upon request.,"While the authors state they sequenced the engineered clones and that mutagenic primer sequences can be provided on request, they do not report depositing sequence data in public databases or provide accession numbers. Therefore sequences were not shown to be made publicly available in the paper."
26559830,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,All clones were sequenced across the entire genome to ensure that no extraneous mutations occurred during the mutagenesis process.

18715920,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,"No — sequences derive from in vitro–selected laboratory strains and recombinant constructs, not from patient samples.","Viral RNA was extracted from culture supernatant or virus stock using a NucliSens easyMAG apparatus (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), a high-throughput automated nucleic acid extraction system. MT4 cells were infected with HIV-1 (IIIB, HXB2D, selected viruses, or SDM viruses; MOI of 0.0001) in the absence of inhibitor.","The methods describe extraction of viral RNA from culture supernatants and sequencing of viruses that were generated or selected in vitro (HIV-1 IIIB, HXB2D, selected viruses, and SDMs). There is no mention of patient-derived specimens, clinical sample collection, or sequencing of viruses directly obtained from infected individuals; all sequencing originates from laboratory virus stocks and recombinant constructs."
18715920,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,Yes — the paper reports in vitro antiviral susceptibility (EC50) and fold-change phenotypic data for selected and recombinant viruses against multiple integrase inhibitors.,The antiviral activity of different inhibitors was determined in a cell-based HIV-1 replication assay. Strain IIIB/GS-9137(#9) (with the mutations T66T/I E92E/Q) showed a sixfold reduced susceptibility to EVG. The finally selected strain IIIB/GS-9137(#41) (H114Y A128T Q148R) showed a 217-fold reduction in susceptibility to EVG. The regrown viruses were genotyped to confirm the previously observed genotypes (Table 2). The eight resistant viruses from the automated IVS were recultured and tested for susceptibility to EVG. Susceptibility to the panel of other IN inhibitors was also determined in order to establish the degree of cross-resistance (Fig. 5).,"The Materials and Methods detail cell-based antiviral assays with EC50 determination and cytotoxicity assays. The Results present quantitative phenotypic data (fold reductions in susceptibility) for multiple selected and recombinant viruses against elvitegravir and other integrase inhibitors, demonstrating that in vitro drug susceptibility testing was performed and reported."
18715920,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No — the paper does not report deposition of sequences in public databases or provide GenBank accession numbers.,"PCR products were genotyped by automated population-based full-sequence analysis (ABI Prism BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing results were reported as amino acid changes compared with the HIV-1 IIIB wild-type reference sequence.","While the genotyping method and how sequencing results were reported are described, the manuscript does not provide any statements about depositing sequences in GenBank or other public repositories, nor does it list accession numbers. The reporting focuses on amino acid changes and genotypes of laboratory-selected viruses rather than providing public sequence accessions."
18715920,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported in the paper.,"PCR products were genotyped by automated population-based full-sequence analysis (ABI Prism BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

18715920,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Zero — no human individuals' samples were sequenced; sequencing was performed on laboratory virus stocks and recombinant viruses.,"Viral RNA was extracted from culture supernatant or virus stock using a NucliSens easyMAG apparatus (bioMérieux...). MT4 cells were infected with HIV-1 (IIIB, HXB2D, selected viruses, or SDM viruses; MOI of 0.0001) in the absence of inhibitor.","All sequencing described was performed on in vitro–generated or -selected virus populations (culture supernatants, virus stocks, and site-directed mutant constructs). There is no indication that clinical or patient-derived samples were obtained or sequenced, so the count of individuals with samples sequenced is zero."
18715920,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Not applicable — sequences derive from laboratory virus stocks and in vitro experiments, not from patient samples in specific countries.","MT4 cells were obtained by transfecting MT4 cells with a selectable construct encompassing the coding sequences for the HIV LTR as a promoter for the expression of EGFP and subsequent selection of permanently transfected cells. HIV-1 IIIB was provided by Guido van der Groen (Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium). HIV-1 molecular clone pHXB2D was provided by the Centre for AIDS Reagents (ARP206; Brussels, Belgium).","The paper describes laboratory reagents and the sources of cell lines and molecular clones (institutions in Belgium and a provider in Japan for MT4), but there is no sequencing of patient-derived samples tied to any country of origin. Therefore, there are no countries of origin for patient-derived sequenced samples to report."
18715920,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not reported / Not applicable — the paper describes passages and days of in vitro selection but does not report calendar years for sample collection.,"In the classical IVS experiment performed in tissue culture flasks, the virus was propagated over 41 passages (144 days) while the concentration of EVG was gradually increased from 5 nM up to 10 μM. Virus was able to grow at the final concentration of 3 μM EVG after 16 to 27 passages or 56 to 95 days (Table 2).","The manuscript provides timing in terms of culture passages and days in vitro but does not give calendar years when the sequenced viruses were generated. Because no patient samples with collection years are involved, there are no reporting years for sequenced clinical samples."
18715920,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,"Population-based (direct) Sanger sequencing was used for virus populations (no cloning); separately, site-directed mutant (SDM) constructs were generated in plasmids and confirmed by sequencing (these constructs were cloned).","PCR products were genotyped by automated population-based full-sequence analysis (ABI Prism BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). SDMs of IN coding sequences were constructed in the pUC19-5′HXB2D vector..., by using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene...). Altered plasmid sequences were confirmed by dideoxyribose sequencing.","The genotyping description specifies population-based sequencing of PCR products from culture supernatant/virus stocks, which indicates direct (bulk) Sanger sequencing rather than sequencing of cloned PCR products. However, the study did create cloned plasmid constructs (SDMs) in pUC19 that were sequence-verified, so cloned constructs were used for recombinant viruses, but the virus population sequencing itself was population-based."
18715920,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"The integrase (IN) coding region of pol was sequenced (cDNA for reverse transcriptase and IN was generated, and the IN region was amplified and genotyped).","cDNA encoding reverse transcriptase and IN was generated with Expand Reverse Transcriptase (Roche Diagnostics...), followed by amplification of the IN region by nested PCR (1,456 bp). The IN-encoding region of the pol gene of the viruses, selected at different passages, was sequenced.","Methods explicitly describe generation of cDNA for RT and IN but indicate that the IN region was the amplified and genotyped target (1,456 bp nested PCR) and the Results describe sequencing of the IN-encoding region. The focus of the study is integrase resistance mutations."

18715920,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No — the paper does not report sequences from treated individuals; sequences are from in vitro-selected viruses and recombinant constructs.,"In total, nine selection experiments with EVG were performed, one by classical IVS and eight by automated IVS. The IN-encoding region of the pol gene of the viruses, selected at different passages, was sequenced.","All data come from in vitro resistance selection experiments using drug pressure in culture and from engineered SDMs. Although the discussion cites clinical observations from other studies, this manuscript does not present sequences from patients who had prior ARV exposure."
18715920,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not applicable — no individuals were sampled; there is no reporting of patient drug exposure. The study exposed laboratory viruses to integrase inhibitors (and used other ARV compounds experimentally).,"Antiviral compounds.

In a first round of selections, we included tenofovir, didanosine, stavudine, apricitabine and abacavir as single drugs for 20 weeks or until a first resistance mutation had appeared.","The study performed in vitro selection experiments to observe which resistance mutations were selected under drug pressure. However, the text describes selection outcomes (which mutations appeared) rather than reporting phenotypic in vitro susceptibility measurements (such as fold-change in IC50).

The study also describes cloning and plasmid-based molecular clones used to generate viruses for assays; these constructs are laboratory materials rather than clinical specimen types."
21115794,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,No.,"S/GSK1349572 was active against most INI-resistant viruses with double or more mutations, including clinical isolates from patients with RAL treatment failure (42). For the analysis of mutations, DNA was extracted from infected cells ... and the integrase region of HIV proviral DNA was amplified by PCR with specific primers.","While the paper references clinical isolates from patients failing raltegravir in the context of prior published work or panels, the sequencing and mutation analyses performed in this study were on lab-passaged viruses, site-directed mutants, and molecular clones. The paper does not report sequencing of viruses directly obtained from patients experiencing virologic failure within this study."
21115794,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — this publication reports preclinical in vitro work, not a clinical trial with patients.","These preclinical findings formed part of the rationale for the selection of S/GSK1349572 as a candidate for clinical development, and they provide a strong foundation for its ongoing clinical investigation. In a 10-day phase 2a monotherapy study, the plasma steady-state geometric mean concentration ... (S. Min et al., submitted for publication).","The manuscript describes in vitro enzymatic and cell-culture experiments and references clinical trials or clinical data elsewhere, but the experiments reported are preclinical and do not involve patients enrolled in a clinical trial within this study."
21115794,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No.,"S/GSK1349572 was active against most INI-resistant viruses with double or more mutations, including clinical isolates from patients with RAL treatment failure (42). For the analysis of mutations, DNA was extracted from infected cells ... and the integrase region of HIV proviral DNA was amplified by PCR with specific primers.","Although the paper discusses and tests susceptibility against previously described ARV-resistant clinical isolates (cited), the sequencing and mutation analyses presented in this study were performed on laboratory strains, passage-derived viruses, and engineered molecular clones, not on sequences obtained from treated patients within this work."
21115794,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not applicable — no individuals' clinical samples were sequenced in this study.,"For the analysis of mutations, DNA was extracted from infected cells using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and the integrase region of HIV proviral DNA was amplified by PCR with specific primers. S/GSK1349572 was evaluated against molecular clones with mutations in the integrase-, RT-, and protease-coding regions.","Since the study did not sequence patient-derived samples, there are no reported prior antiretroviral therapies for sequenced individuals. The experiments involved laboratory strains and engineered mutants rather than clinical subjects."
21115794,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not applicable — no patient-derived sequenced samples, so no patient drug histories are reported.","S/GSK1349572 was tested in combination assays with representatives of all approved classes of HIV therapeutics, as well as with adefovir and ribavirin, drugs likely to be coadministered to HIV patients coinfected with HBV or HCV. For the analysis of mutations, DNA was extracted from infected cells and the integrase region was amplified and sequenced.","The manuscript focuses on in vitro drug activity, passage selection, and molecular cloning; it does not present sequencing of patient-derived viruses nor any associated patient antiretroviral histories, so no drugs received by sequenced individuals are reported."
27009474,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,We describe an individual with transmitted four-class drug resistance whose virus sequence had the previously uncharacterized mutation Q148N. The sequence of the clinical clone has been submitted to the GenBank under the accession number KU761565.,"The body and abstract explicitly describe a patient-derived virus sequence (the patient with transmitted resistance and identification of Q148N). The Sequence Data section states that the sequence of the clinical clone was submitted to GenBank, confirming that sequences from a patient sample were obtained and characterized."
27009474,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,Yes.,Infectious molecular HIV-1 clones containing Q148N alone and in combination with G140S demonstrated ∼2.4--4.5 reduced elvitegravir susceptibility depending on the virus's genetic context but retained susceptibility to raltegravir and dolutegravir. These clones were subjected for phenotypic susceptibility testing using the PhenoSense assay (Monogram).,"The authors created site-directed and recombinant infectious molecular clones and performed phenotypic susceptibility testing (PhenoSense), reporting fold-changes in susceptibility to elvitegravir, raltegravir, and dolutegravir. This is direct in vitro phenotypic drug susceptibility data."
27009474,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,Yes.,"The sequence of the clinical clone has been submitted to the GenBank under the accession number KU761565. Of 1,120 integrase sequences from patients receiving raltegravir in GenBank as of June 2015, 23%, 8%, and 1% had the previously characterized INSTI-resistance mutations Q148H, Q148R, and Q148K, respectively.","The Sequence Data section explicitly states that the clinical clone sequence was submitted to GenBank (KU761565), indicating public availability. The comment about integrase sequences in GenBank further supports the use of public sequence databases in the study."
27009474,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,KU761565.,The sequence of the clinical clone has been submitted to the GenBank under the accession number KU761565. Q148N was present in viruses from three raltegravir-experienced individuals and is the only other mutation at this position detected in GenBank sequences.,The Sequence Data section provides a single accession number (KU761565) for the clinical clone sequence submitted by the authors. Other GenBank sequences are referenced in aggregate but no other specific accession numbers are provided in this paper.
27009474,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,One individual (the reported patient).,"A 50-year-old hispanic homosexual man underwent HIV-1 seroconversion in August 2014. In November 2014, the patient changed clinics and an INSTI resistance test was ordered on his August 2014 sample.","The report is a case report focused on a single patient whose August 2014 sample was tested and from which a clinical clone was derived and sequenced. While the paper references other sequences in GenBank, the experimental sequencing and clone derived in this study came from this one patient."
27009474,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not specified in the paper.,"A 50-year-old hispanic homosexual man underwent HIV-1 seroconversion in August 2014. In November 2014, the patient changed clinics and an INSTI resistance test was ordered on his August 2014 sample.","The manuscript describes the patient's demographics (age, ethnicity, sexual orientation) and clinic changes but does not state the country or geographic location where the sample was obtained. Therefore the country is not specified in the paper."
27009474,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,2014 (the patient sample was obtained in August 2014).,"A 50-year-old hispanic homosexual man underwent HIV-1 seroconversion in August 2014. In November 2014, the patient changed clinics and an INSTI resistance test was ordered on his August 2014 sample.","The paper indicates the relevant clinical sample was collected in August 2014 and the INSTI resistance test was performed on that August 2014 sample. Although molecular cloning and phenotypic testing were performed in 2015, the sequenced clinical sample was from 2014."
27009474,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,"Yes, infectious molecular clones were created and sequenced (clinical clone).","In 2015, we created a panel of infectious molecular clones to assess the effect of the novel mutation Q148N on INSTI susceptibility. The panel included site-directed HIV-1 mutants containing G140S+Q148N, Q148N alone, G140S+Q148H, and Q148H alone.","The authors explicitly state that they generated a panel of infectious molecular clones, including a clinical clone derived from the patient's sample; the Sequence Data section reports submission of the clinical clone sequence to GenBank, indicating cloning prior to sequence submission/analysis."
27009474,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Integrase was explicitly sequenced; protease and reverse transcriptase regions were also assessed via baseline genotypic resistance testing (i.e., protease and RT regions of pol).","A baseline genotypic resistance test revealed the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistance mutations L210W and T215D ... the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-resistance mutations K101P and K103S ... and the protease inhibitor-resistance mutations D30N, L33F, I54V, N88D, and L90M. In November 2014, ... an INSTI resistance test was ordered on his August 2014 sample. The test revealed G140S ... and Q148N, a previously uncharacterized mutation in the INSTI-binding pocket of integrase enzyme.","The baseline genotypic resistance test identified RT and protease mutations, indicating those gene regions were sequenced/analyzed. The INSTI resistance test and discussion of Q148N/G140S indicate sequencing of the integrase gene. Together this indicates sequencing/analysis of protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase (regions within pol)."
27009474,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not specified (the paper does not state the sequencing platform or method).,"A baseline genotypic resistance test revealed the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistance mutations L210W and T215D ... and the protease inhibitor-resistance mutations D30N, L33F, I54V, N88D, and L90M. These clones were subjected for phenotypic susceptibility testing using the PhenoSense assay (Monogram).","While the paper describes genotypic resistance testing and phenotypic (PhenoSense) susceptibility testing and reports sequence submission to GenBank, it does not describe the sequencing methodology (e.g., Sanger, NGS) or protocols used to generate the sequence reads. Therefore the specific sequencing method is not provided."
27009474,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma-derived HIV-1 (the patient's August 2014 plasma sample) and infectious molecular clones derived from that clinical sample.,"His plasma HIV-1 RNA level was 3,980 copies/ml. In November 2014, the patient changed clinics and an INSTI resistance test was ordered on his August 2014 sample. The sequence of the clinical clone has been submitted to the GenBank under the accession number KU761565.","The text refers to plasma HIV-1 RNA and an INSTI resistance test on the August 2014 sample, indicating plasma-derived virus was used. The authors also constructed infectious molecular clones from the patient's sample and sequenced/submitted the clinical clone sequence."
27009474,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,No — the patient reported in this paper was virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml) on therapy at the time of the INSTI resistance test.,"At the same time, the plasma HIV-1 RNA level was <50 copies/ml and CD4 count was 767 cells/mm3. The patient has since been monitored closely and multiple subsequent plasma HIV-1 RNA levels have been <50 copies/ml.","The patient whose sample was sequenced had viral load <50 copies/ml while on therapy and maintained suppression, indicating no virological failure. Although the authors note Q148N has been seen in raltegravir-experienced individuals in GenBank, the sequences generated and analyzed in this study were from a virologically suppressed patient."
27009474,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No.,A 50-year-old hispanic homosexual man underwent HIV-1 seroconversion in August 2014. The patient was started on the once daily integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-containing fixed-dose combination tenofovir/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat.,"The report describes a single clinical case with routine care (genotypic testing, clinic change, initiation of standard fixed-dose therapy) and does not mention enrollment in any clinical trial. Therefore the patient was not part of a trial as described in the paper."
27009474,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"The primary sequenced individual was treatment-naive at the time of sampling (transmitted resistance), but the paper references other sequences from raltegravir-experienced individuals in GenBank.",A baseline genotypic resistance test revealed ... mutations ... The patient was started on the once daily integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-containing fixed-dose combination tenofovir/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat. Q148N was present in viruses from three raltegravir-experienced individuals and is the only other mutation at this position detected in GenBank sequences.,"The clinical sample analyzed in this study was obtained at baseline (prior to the reported start of therapy) and therefore came from a person who had not previously received ARV therapy (though their virus harbored transmitted resistance). The paper also cites GenBank records showing Q148N in raltegravir-experienced individuals, but those are external sequences, not newly sequenced ARV-experienced patients in this study."
27009474,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,For the primary patient sample: none prior to the sampled baseline (treatment-naive). The paper references other individuals in GenBank who were raltegravir-experienced (INSTI class).,A baseline genotypic resistance test revealed the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistance mutations ... and the protease inhibitor-resistance mutations ... The patient was started on the once daily integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-containing fixed-dose combination tenofovir/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat. Q148N was present in viruses from three raltegravir-experienced individuals...,"The baseline genotypic test was performed on the August 2014 sample prior to the reported initiation of therapy, indicating the patient had not received ARVs before that sample. The authors do reference sequences from raltegravir-experienced (INSTI-treated) individuals in GenBank, but those are not additional patients sequenced in this study."
27009474,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"The primary patient had not received antiretroviral drugs prior to the sampled baseline (treatment-naive). The patient was started on tenofovir/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat after the baseline sample, and the paper references other (GenBank) sequences from raltegravir-experienced individuals.",A baseline genotypic resistance test revealed ... The patient was started on the once daily integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-containing fixed-dose combination tenofovir/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat. Q148N was present in viruses from three raltegravir-experienced individuals...,"The sequence analyzed in this study came from the baseline (August 2014) sample, which was taken before the patient was started on the TDF/FTC/elvitegravir/cobicistat regimen; thus no ARV drugs were received prior to that sampled time point. The paper does note other sequences from raltegravir-experienced individuals in public databases, indicating prior exposure to the INSTI raltegravir in those external cases."
27124362,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,No.,"NNRTI resistant mutations in HIV-1 RT are described in supplemental information. We initially investigated the L100I, K103N, Y181C, Y188L, H221Y, and K103N/Y181C RT mutants.","The paper describes testing of known RT mutants and mentions that the NNRTI-resistant mutations and vector constructs are described in supplemental information. All experimental work described uses single-round infection assays with engineered or cell-culture-selected mutant viruses rather than reporting sequencing of patient-derived viral samples, and there are no passages that present patient sequence data or GenBank entries. Therefore the study does not report HIV sequences obtained from patient samples."
27124362,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,Yes.,"Using a single round HIV-1 infection assay, we tested RPV and DOR against a broad panel of NNRTI resistant mutants to determine their respective activities. The ability of RPV and DOR to inhibit the replication of WT HIV-1 and drug-resistant mutants was measured using a previously described single-round infection assay [19].","The paper repeatedly reports IC50 measurements from single-round infection (cell-based) assays for RPV and DOR against wild-type and many NNRTI-resistant mutants, with numerical IC50 values provided throughout the Results (e.g., 0.67 ± 0.14 nM for WT DOR, various nm ranges and >100 nM values for resistant mutants). These are in vitro susceptibility data."
27124362,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No — the paper does not report making sequences publicly available.,NNRTI resistant mutations in HIV-1 RT are described in supplemental information. We do not yet have access to crystal structures of DOR bound to mutant forms of RT.,"The manuscript refers to mutations and constructs in supplemental information and discusses crystal structures reported elsewhere, but it does not provide sequence listings, accession numbers, or statements that sequences were deposited in public databases. There are no GenBank accession numbers or similar identifiers in the text, so sequences were not made publicly available as part of this paper."
27124362,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,NNRTI resistant mutations in HIV-1 RT are described in supplemental information. The paper describes IC50 data and structural comparisons but does not list GenBank accession numbers or sequence identifiers.,"No GenBank accession numbers or other public sequence identifiers appear in the manuscript. The study focuses on phenotypic assays with engineered or previously described mutants and structural analyses, and it does not present newly deposited sequence data."
27124362,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Zero (no patient samples were sequenced in this study).,"We initially investigated the L100I, K103N, Y181C, Y188L, H221Y, and K103N/Y181C RT mutants. V106A was the major variant selected by DOR treatment of HIV-1 in cultured cells [17].","All experiments described involve engineered mutants, mutants selected in cell culture, or previously reported patient-selected mutations; the paper does not describe collecting samples from individual patients for sequencing, nor does it state a number of patient samples analyzed. Thus no individuals had samples obtained for sequencing in this study."
27124362,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable — no patient-derived sequences were reported.,NNRTI resistant mutations in HIV-1 RT are described in supplemental information. The experiments described use single-round infection assays with WT and mutant HIV-1 vectors and mutants selected in cell culture or previously reported from patients.,"Because the study did not report sequencing of patient samples, there are no country origins of sequenced samples to report. The paper discusses mutations observed in patients in prior studies but does not present new geographically annotated sequence data."
27124362,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable — no patient-derived sequencing was reported in this paper.,"NNRTI resistant mutations in HIV-1 RT are described in supplemental information. The paper reports in vitro selection in cell culture and references mutations ""selected in patients"" from prior work but does not report dates of sequencing from patient samples.","Since no sequencing of patient-derived samples was performed or reported, there are no years of sample collection to provide."
27124362,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not applicable — no sequencing was performed on patient-derived samples.,NNRTI resistant mutations in HIV-1 RT are described in supplemental information. The study used virion production and single-round infectivity assays and tested vectors that carry WT RT and specific RT mutants.,"The methods describe use of viral vectors and functional assays rather than sequencing workflows; there is no description of cloning patient-derived viral genomes for sequencing, so cloning prior to sequencing is not applicable."
27124362,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,No genes were newly sequenced in this study; the gene analyzed functionally and structurally is reverse transcriptase (RT).,NNRTI resistant mutations in HIV-1 RT are described in supplemental information. The ability of RPV and DOR to inhibit the replication of WT HIV-1 and drug-resistant mutants was measured using a previously described single-round infection assay [19].,"Although the paper does not report sequencing, all mutational and structural analyses concern HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Therefore RT is the gene/protein of interest in the work, but no new sequence data for any gene are reported."
27124362,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not applicable — the paper does not report performing sequencing.,Virion production and single-round infectivity assays were used to determine antiviral activity (IC50 values) of the compounds as described [19] and discussed in the supplemental information. NNRTI resistant mutations in HIV-1 RT are described in supplemental information.,"The methods describe virological assays and structural modeling/crystal structures from other studies; there is no description of sequencing methods (e.g., Sanger or NGS) carried out in this work, so no sequencing method can be reported."
27124362,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Not applicable — no sequencing of patient samples was performed; the experimental material consisted of HIV-1 viral vectors/viruses (engineered or cell-culture-selected mutants).,"Using a single round HIV-1 infection assay, we tested RPV and DOR against a broad panel of NNRTI resistant mutants to determine their respective activities. V106A was the major variant selected by DOR treatment of HIV-1 in cultured cells [17].",The study employed laboratory-produced HIV-1 vectors and viruses containing specific RT mutations (some selected in cell culture and some previously reported from patients) in cell-based assays. There is no report of sequencing clinical sample types such as plasma or PBMCs.
27124362,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No — the paper did not generate or report patient-derived sequences, although it discusses mutations that are observed in virological failures in prior studies.","The E138K substitution in RT is the most common NNRTI-resistance mutation seen in patients who fail RPV-containing regimens [13]. We screened a panel of mutants that included: E40K, D67E, K101E, V111A, E138K, M184I, M184V, K101E/M184I, K101E/M184V, E138K/M184I, and E138K/M184V (Fig. 3) to determine whether these mutants are susceptible to DOR.","The manuscript references and tests mutants that have been observed in patients failing NNRTI regimens (e.g., E138K), but it does not state that the authors obtained sequences from those failing patients for this study. Therefore no sequences were obtained from individuals with virological failure in this work."
27124362,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No — this study is an in vitro and structural study and did not involve patients or clinical trial participants.,"Using a single round HIV-1 infection assay, we tested RPV and DOR against a broad panel of NNRTI resistant mutants to determine their respective activities. The study discusses DOR as a new NNRTI which is in phase III clinical trials, but the experimental work reported is laboratory-based.","All described experiments are cell-based assays and structural analyses; there is no enrollment of patients, no clinical trial conduct, and no patient-level clinical data reported in this manuscript."
27124362,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No — the paper does not report any patient-derived sequences; it discusses and tests mutations that have been observed in individuals on ARV therapy in prior studies.,"The E138K substitution in RT is the most common NNRTI-resistance mutation seen in patients who fail RPV-containing regimens [13]. We screened a panel of mutants that included ... mutations selected by RPV in infected individuals during cART (K101E, E138K, M184I, M184V, ...).","Although the paper evaluates mutants that arose in the context of ARV therapy (cART) in earlier reports, the current study does not present sequences obtained from such treated individuals; instead, it uses mutants (engineered or previously described) in laboratory assays."
27124362,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not applicable — no individuals were sampled or sequenced in this study. The manuscript does refer to antiretroviral drug classes such as NNRTIs and NRTIs in the discussion/context.,"Current cART regimens use combinations of at least 3 drugs to fully suppress HIV-1 replication. In some cases, drugs in the same class can be used together if they select for non-overlapping resistance mutations, such as the NRTIs tenofovir and FTC [23].","Because there were no patient samples sequenced, there is no patient drug-history data to report. For context the paper discusses NNRTIs (RPV, DOR, ETR) and NRTIs (tenofovir, FTC, 3TC) as classes relevant to resistance and cART regimens, but this does not reflect individual patient treatment histories in this study."
27124362,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not applicable — no patients were sampled or sequenced. The paper references several specific ARV drugs in context (e.g., RPV, DOR, ETR, 3TC, FTC, tenofovir).","Rilpivirine (RPV) is the latest non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) to be FDA-approved to combat HIV-1 infections. Because many of the commonly used cART regimens include either 3TC or FTC, some isolates from virological failures also contained the M184V/I mutation.","The manuscript does not report individual-level ARV exposure data because no patient sequencing was performed. It does, however, mention relevant drugs when discussing resistance (RPV, DOR, ETR) and commonly used NRTIs (3TC, FTC, tenofovir) to provide context about resistance selection observed in prior clinical settings."
29373677,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,"Yes. The paper reports genotypic analysis of the integrase gene from patient samples (PBMC DNA and plasma RNA) and identifies specific mutations (N155H, K156N, K211R, E212T).","Integrase genotypic analysis was performed on DNA from PBMCs, when the plasma viral load was below 20 copies/mL and on plasma RNA when it was detectable above 20 copies/mL. At the same time, N155H was also identified (Table 1).","The Results section explicitly describes performing integrase genotypic analysis on DNA extracted from PBMCs and on plasma RNA, and reports identified integrase mutations including N155H, K156N, K211R and E212T. These statements indicate that sequences (or at least genotypic data) from patient-derived samples were generated and analyzed."
29373677,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,Yes. The paper reports both cell-free and cell-based (culture) assays measuring IC50/EC50 for raltegravir and dolutegravir and other susceptibility readouts.,"Cell-free and culture-based assays confirm that selected mutations in the patient, in the context of the polymorphic mutation K156N present at the baseline, lead to high resistance to dolutegravir. We determined the EC50 of each mutant by infecting HeLa-P4 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of raltegravir and dolutegravir.","The Methods and Results describe HIV infectivity assays, cell-free integrase enzymatic assays, and reporting of IC50 and EC50 values for raltegravir and dolutegravir. Those are standard in vitro drug susceptibility experiments, so the paper clearly contains in vitro susceptibility data."
29373677,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No. The paper does not report deposition of sequences or provide public accession numbers.,"Integrase genotypic analysis was performed on DNA from PBMCs, when the plasma viral load was below 20 copies/mL and on plasma RNA when it was detectable above 20 copies/mL. Genotypic analysis before 2014 identified no resistance mutations, but a polymorphism was highlighted at position 156 with a K156N present throughout the study.","Although the paper describes genotypic analyses and refers to Table 1 for mutation details, there is no statement in the provided text indicating deposition of sequences in public databases (e.g., GenBank) or listing accession numbers. Because no accession or deposition statement appears, sequences were not documented as made publicly available in the text provided."
29373677,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported. The paper does not provide GenBank accession numbers.,"Integrase genotypic analysis was performed on DNA from PBMCs, when the plasma viral load was below 20 copies/mL and on plasma RNA when it was detectable above 20 copies/mL. At the same time, N155H was also identified (Table 1).","The Results describe genotyping and mutations and reference Table 1, but the provided content contains no GenBank accession numbers or any mention of sequence deposition. Therefore no accession numbers were reported in the paper text provided."
29373677,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,One individual (a single patient case).,"In this study, we report the case of a patient treated with dolutegravir monotherapy. The patient infected with a B subtype HIV-1 strain received an antiretroviral treatment including INSTIs from 2008 to 2015.","The paper repeatedly refers to 'the patient' and describes a single-case clinical history and the mutations emerging in that individual, indicating that samples for sequencing/genotyping were obtained from one person."
29373677,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not reported. The paper does not specify the country of origin for the patient/sample in the provided text.,Information was obtained from the existing electronic database or medical records. Patients were informed that their demographic and clinical data would be recorded during their follow-up and their blood samples would be stored and could be used for retrospective studies and they gave their consent.,"The Methods and Results describe ethics and clinical sampling but give no geographic or country information about the patient. No country or location is mentioned in the provided content, so the country of origin is not reported."
29373677,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Samples were obtained during the patient's clinical follow-up around 2014–2015 (treatment history spans 2008–2015, with dolutegravir monotherapy started in 2014 and viral rebound five months later).","The patient infected with a B subtype HIV-1 strain received an antiretroviral treatment including INSTIs from 2008 to 2015. Owing to treatment intolerance, a simplification of treatment with dolutegravir monotherapy ... was proposed to the patient in 2014. Five months later, the viral load became detectable in plasma at 291 copies/mL.","The timeline indicates the patient was treated from 2008–2015, dolutegravir monotherapy began in 2014, and genotypic analyses detecting emergent mutations were performed within months after dolutegravir initiation. Thus the relevant samples for sequencing/genotyping were obtained in 2014–2015."
29373677,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No. The paper does not report cloning of patient samples prior to genotypic analysis.,"Integrase genotypic analysis was performed on DNA from PBMCs, when the plasma viral load was below 20 copies/mL and on plasma RNA when it was detectable above 20 copies/mL. Every 6 months, during follow-up, genotypic analysis of integrase was tested in DNA and never showed any mutations selected against raltegravir.","The methods and results describe genotypic analysis on PBMC DNA and plasma RNA but do not describe cloning steps (e.g., PCR product cloning, single-genome amplification or cloning into vectors) prior to sequencing. Because cloning procedures are not described, cloning was not performed or at least not reported."
29373677,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,The integrase (IN) gene (HIV-1 integrase region) was sequenced/genotyped.,Failure of dolutegravir treatment was observed concomitant with the appearance of N155H-K211R-E212T mutations in the integrase (IN) gene in addition to the polymorphic K156N mutation that was present at baseline in this patient. Integrase genotypic analysis was performed on DNA from PBMCs ... and on plasma RNA ...,The paper consistently focuses on mutations in the integrase gene and describes genotypic analysis of integrase from patient-derived DNA and RNA. No other HIV genes are reported as sequenced in the provided text.
29373677,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not reported. The paper states genotypic analysis was performed but does not specify the sequencing method.,"Every 6 months, during follow-up, genotypic analysis of integrase was tested in DNA and never showed any mutations selected against raltegravir. Integrase genotypic analysis was performed on DNA from PBMCs, when the plasma viral load was below 20 copies/mL and on plasma RNA when it was detectable above 20 copies/mL.","Although the paper describes performing genotypic analyses (i.e., sequencing/genotyping) of integrase, the methods section provided does not include details about the sequencing technology or protocol (e.g., Sanger sequencing, next-generation sequencing, primers, PCR conditions). Therefore the specific sequencing method is not reported in the provided content."
29373677,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,"DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma RNA were analyzed (i.e., PBMC DNA and plasma viral RNA).","Integrase genotypic analysis was performed on DNA from PBMCs, when the plasma viral load was below 20 copies/mL and on plasma RNA when it was detectable above 20 copies/mL. Plasma RNA genotyping, 5 months after the start of dolutegravir monotherapy, confirmed the existence of the K211R (AGA) mutation at position 211.","The Results explicitly state that genotyping was done on PBMC DNA and on plasma RNA depending on viral load, indicating that both types of patient-derived specimens were used for sequencing/genotypic analysis."
29373677,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Yes. Sequences/genotypic data were obtained from a patient who experienced virological failure on dolutegravir monotherapy (viral load became detectable).,"In this study, we report the case of a patient treated with dolutegravir monotherapy. Five months later, the viral load became detectable in plasma at 291 copies/mL. Plasma RNA genotyping, 5 months after the start of dolutegravir monotherapy, confirmed the existence of the K211R (AGA) mutation ... At the same time, N155H was also identified (Table 1).","The paper describes a patient who developed detectable plasma viremia while on dolutegravir monotherapy and reports the emergence of integrase resistance mutations identified by genotyping of that patient's samples, demonstrating sequences/genotypes were obtained in the context of virological failure."
29373677,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No. The paper reports a single patient case and does not indicate enrollment in a clinical trial.,"In this study, we report the case of a patient treated with dolutegravir monotherapy. Owing to treatment intolerance, a simplification of treatment with dolutegravir monotherapy (not currently recommended in any guidelines for HIV-1 treatment) was proposed to the patient in 2014 while the viral load was still undetectable.","The text describes an individual clinical management decision (treatment simplification) and explicitly notes the approach is not guideline-recommended; there is no mention of a trial name, protocol, or trial enrollment. Thus the patient was not part of a clinical trial per the provided content."
29373677,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes. The patient had prior antiretroviral therapy including raltegravir and tenofovir/emtricitabine before the dolutegravir monotherapy and sequencing.,"The patient infected with a B subtype HIV-1 strain received an antiretroviral treatment including INSTIs from 2008 to 2015. The patient was first treated with raltegravir in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada) for 6 years until 2014, during which time the viral load remained undetectable.",The Results describe the patient's prior antiretroviral treatment history (including raltegravir and Truvada) before the emergence of integrase mutations and subsequent genotyping; therefore sequences/genotypes were obtained from an individual with prior ARV exposure.
29373677,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Integrase strand-transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) and nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).,The patient ... received an antiretroviral treatment including INSTIs from 2008 to 2015. The patient was first treated with raltegravir in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada) for 6 years until 2014.,"Raltegravir and dolutegravir are INSTIs; tenofovir and emtricitabine (Truvada) are NRTIs. The paper explicitly notes prior INSTI use and specifies Truvada, indicating exposure to these two drug classes prior to the samples/sequencing reported."
29373677,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Raltegravir and tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada); subsequently the patient received dolutegravir monotherapy (the failure occurred on dolutegravir).,"The patient was first treated with raltegravir in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada) for 6 years until 2014. Owing to treatment intolerance, a simplification of treatment with dolutegravir monotherapy ... was proposed to the patient in 2014.","The Results section lists the specific drugs in the patient's treatment history: raltegravir and the combination tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada) prior to 2014, and then dolutegravir monotherapy starting in 2014 when the viral rebound and genotyping occurred. These are the drugs mentioned in the provided content."
32601157,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,"No — the study did not report sequencing of primary patient samples; it used engineered IN mutants, recombinant vectors, and some references to patient-derived IN sequences introduced into laboratory constructs, but no primary patient sequence datasets were reported.","Additional mutants have been selected with DTG, BIC, and CAB using recombinant strains that carried a patient-derived IN with or without the E157Q substitution (24, 28). The DNA sequence of each of the mutant constructs was verified by sequencing.","The manuscript describes construction of IN mutants by site-directed mutagenesis and use of recombinant vectors; it explicitly states that some recombinant strains carried a 'patient-derived IN', but this refers to incorporation of a previously obtained patient-derived IN into recombinant laboratory strains rather than reporting new sequencing of patient samples. The methods describe sequencing to verify cloned constructs, not sequencing of primary patient-derived clinical samples or reporting of patient sequence datasets."
32601157,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,Yes — extensive in vitro drug susceptibility (antiviral potency) data are reported using single-round infectivity assays.,"We tested our best inhibitors, in parallel with DTG, BIC, and CAB, in a single-round infection assay against a panel of the new CAB-resistant mutants. HIV-based viral vectors with either WT or mutant IN were used in single-round infectivity assays to determine the antiviral potencies (EC50 values) of the compounds as previously described (43).","The Results and Methods sections repeatedly describe measuring EC50 values and fold-changes in potency for multiple compounds against engineered IN mutants using single-round infectivity (in vitro) assays, demonstrating that in vitro susceptibility testing was a central component of the study."
32601157,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No — the paper does not report making sequences publicly available (no accession numbers or database deposits are provided).,"The DNA sequence of each of the mutant constructs was verified by sequencing.

32601157,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No — there were no patients enrolled in a clinical trial in this study; the work was laboratory-based using viral vectors and engineered mutants.,"HIV-based viral vectors with either WT or mutant IN were used in single-round infectivity assays to determine the antiviral potencies (EC50 values) of the compounds as previously described (43). Additional mutants have been selected with DTG, BIC, and CAB using recombinant strains that carried a patient-derived IN with or without the E157Q substitution (24, 28).","The methods and results describe in vitro experiments with plasmid constructs, pseudotyped viruses, and recombinant strains; no patient enrollment, clinical trial procedures, or trial identifiers are mentioned, indicating this is not a clinical-trial study."
32601157,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"No — the paper does not report sequences obtained from individuals with known prior ARV exposure; it focuses on engineered mutants and in vitro selections, though it discusses INSTI-experienced patients in the literature context.","Based on currently available data, it appears that DTG and BIC provide a strong and safe treatment strategy for treatment-naive patients (36, -- 41). For INSTI-experienced patients, who have undergone virological failure and switched regimens to a salvage therapy, these new INSTIs may not always be effective ...

The paper does not provide country-level origins for sequenced samples (no sequencing reported) or for most isolates.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) infection remains a significant public health problem in West Africa, where the virus is endemic, and affects other areas with socioeconomic ties to the region. The remaining HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates used in this study were obtained from NIH ARP.","While the paper notes that HIV-2 is endemic in West Africa and lists sources (NIH ARP, specific investigators) for some isolates, it does not provide country-of-origin details for the isolates used nor any deposited sequence metadata indicating sampling countries."
30803972,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not specified. The paper does not report years of sample collection or sequencing.,"The remaining HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates used in this study were obtained from NIH ARP. To further evaluate the potential suitability of bictegravir for HIV-2 treatment, we tested the activity of the drug against a panel of group A and group B HIV-2 isolates from ART-naive individuals.",The manuscript provides no information on dates or years of specimen collection or sequencing. It focuses on assay results and sources of isolates without temporal metadata.
30803972,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,"Not applicable for sequencing. The study used existing molecular clones and generated site-directed mutant clones, but it did not report cloning patient-derived sequences for sequencing.","Master stocks and working dilutions of the drug were prepared as previously described for cabotegravir. Clones p89.6 and pMJ4 (encoding HIV-1) and pHIV-2/ST were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program (ARP). Cell-free stocks of HIV-1 NL4-3, HIV-1 89.6, HIV-1 MJ4, HIV-2 ROD9, and HIV-2 ST were generated by transfecting the corresponding plasmid molecular clones into cultures of 293T/17 human embryonic kidney cells as previously described.","The paper describes use of plasmid molecular clones to generate virus stocks and the construction of site-directed mutants, indicating cloning work was done for experimental constructs. However, there is no description of cloning patient-derived samples for sequencing, and no sequencing reported, so the question about cloning prior to sequencing is not applicable."
30803972,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Not applicable — the paper does not report sequencing gene regions; however, the study focused on the integrase-encoding region of pol (site-directed mutations were constructed and tested).","We also constructed and tested HIV-2 ROD9 variants that contained site-directed mutations in the integrase-encoding region of pol; these mutations emerge in raltegravir-treated HIV-2-infected patients and are known to confer resistance to raltegravir and other INIs in culture. Next, we constructed and tested HIV-2 ROD9 variants that contained site-directed mutations in the integrase-encoding region of pol.","Although no sequencing is described, the experimental emphasis was on integrase (part of pol) — site-directed mutants in integrase were constructed and phenotyped. Because the paper does not present sequencing of gene regions from patient samples, there are no reported sequenced genes per se."
30803972,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not applicable. The paper does not describe any sequencing methods because it does not report sequence data.,"All drug susceptibility measurements were performed using our established MAGIC-5A indicator cell assay, which quantifies drug-dependent inhibition in a single round of HIV infection. Clones p89.6 and pMJ4 (encoding HIV-1) and pHIV-2/ST were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program (ARP).","The methods focus on phenotypic assays (MAGIC-5A single-cycle assay), molecular clones, and construction of site-directed mutants; no nucleotide sequencing methods (e.g., Sanger or next-generation sequencing) are described in the manuscript, so no sequencing method was used/reported."
30803972,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Not applicable. No sequencing of samples was reported. The study used cell-free virus stocks generated from plasmid molecular clones and virus isolates obtained from reagent sources.,"Cell-free stocks of HIV-1 NL4-3, HIV-1 89.6, HIV-1 MJ4, HIV-2 ROD9, and HIV-2 ST were generated by transfecting the corresponding plasmid molecular clones into cultures of 293T/17 human embryonic kidney cells as previously described. The remaining HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates used in this study were obtained from NIH ARP.","The manuscript describes the origin of viral stocks (molecular clones, NIH ARP isolates, isolates provided by investigators) and experimental use in cell-culture assays, but it does not report sequencing of any sample types (e.g., plasma, PBMC-derived RNA/DNA) or provide sequencing data."
30803972,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No. The isolates tested in this study were from ART-naive individuals, and no sequences from treatment-failure patients were reported here.","To further evaluate the potential suitability of bictegravir for HIV-2 treatment, we tested the activity of the drug against a panel of group A and group B HIV-2 isolates from ART-naive individuals. Our analysis indicates that bictegravir is a potent inhibitor of HIV-2 isolates from ART-naive individuals (Table 2).","The paper explicitly states that the HIV-2 isolates tested were from ART-naive individuals, indicating they were not from patients with virological failure on ART. While the manuscript references other studies that included INI-treated patients, those are cited as external reports and not part of this paper's reported sequences or isolates."
30803972,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No. The study was an in vitro laboratory investigation using isolates and molecular clones, not a clinical trial.","All drug susceptibility measurements were performed using our established MAGIC-5A indicator cell assay, which quantifies drug-dependent inhibition in a single round of HIV infection. To further evaluate the potential suitability of bictegravir for HIV-2 treatment, we tested the activity of the drug against a panel of group A and group B HIV-2 isolates from ART-naive individuals.","The manuscript describes laboratory-based phenotypic assays on viral isolates and constructed mutants; there is no mention of patient enrollment, clinical trial conduct, or clinical outcomes. Thus, the work is preclinical/in vitro rather than a clinical trial."
30803972,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"No. The isolates tested were from ART-naive individuals, and the paper does not report sequences from ARV-experienced individuals.","To further evaluate the potential suitability of bictegravir for HIV-2 treatment, we tested the activity of the drug against a panel of group A and group B HIV-2 isolates from ART-naive individuals. Our analysis indicates that bictegravir is a potent inhibitor of HIV-2 isolates from ART-naive individuals (Table 2).","The study explicitly states the isolates were from ART-naive individuals. Although the paper discusses resistance mutations that arise in treated patients and cites other studies involving INI-treated patients, it does not present sequences from ARV-experienced individuals itself."
30803972,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not applicable. The individuals from whom isolates were obtained were ART-naive and thus had not received antiretroviral drug classes prior to sampling.,"To further evaluate the potential suitability of bictegravir for HIV-2 treatment, we tested the activity of the drug against a panel of group A and group B HIV-2 isolates from ART-naive individuals. Our analysis indicates that bictegravir is a potent inhibitor of HIV-2 isolates from ART-naive individuals (Table 2).","Because the isolates came from ART-naive individuals, there is no exposure to antiretroviral drug classes to report for those subjects in this study."
30803972,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not applicable. The study samples came from ART-naive individuals who had not received antiretroviral drugs prior to sampling.,"To further evaluate the potential suitability of bictegravir for HIV-2 treatment, we tested the activity of the drug against a panel of group A and group B HIV-2 isolates from ART-naive individuals. Our analysis indicates that bictegravir is a potent inhibitor of HIV-2 isolates from ART-naive individuals (Table 2).","The manuscript explicitly states isolates were from ART-naive individuals; therefore, no prior antiretroviral drugs were received by those individuals and no drug list is provided."
28559249,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,No — the paper reports patient-derived viral isolates and recombinant clones but does not present nucleotide sequence data in the text.,"In the present study, we tested the activity of MK-8591 against a panel of HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains that were originally isolated from ART-naive individuals. We initially compared the ability of MK-8591 to inhibit two prototypic isolates derived from full-length plasmid molecular clones: HIV-1 NL4-3 and HIV-2 ROD9. A site-directed mutant of HIV-1 NL4-3 encoding the M184V replacement was included in this analysis as an MK-8591-resistant control.","The manuscript describes use of viral isolates and molecular/recombinant clones and reports phenotypic drug susceptibility data for those viruses, but nowhere in the provided content are nucleotide sequences, sequence alignments, or listing of sequence data presented. Sentences describe isolates and clones used in experiments, which indicates patient-derived viruses were studied, but the paper does not display or report raw HIV sequence data from patient samples within the text."
28559249,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,Yes.,"Unless otherwise specified, drug susceptibility measurements were performed using MAGIC-5A indicator cells, which are CD4+ CXCR4+ CCR5+ HeLa cells containing an HIV-inducible reporter gene (HIV LTR--β-galactosidase). In these experiments, the mean EC50 for HIV-1 NL4-3 was 2.0 ± 0.6 nM. Other HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates from ART-naive individuals showed a similar trend with respect to MK-8591 susceptibility in the single-cycle assay (Fig. 3A).","The paper explicitly describes single-cycle in vitro antiviral assays (MAGIC-5A cells) and reports EC50 values for multiple HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates (including mean EC50s and ranges). These are standard in vitro drug susceptibility measurements, so the presence of EC50 data and assay descriptions supports a clear yes."
28559249,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No — the paper does not report that sequences were deposited or provide accession numbers.,"In the present study, we tested the activity of MK-8591 against a panel of HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains that were originally isolated from ART-naive individuals. To identify structural features that might explain the increased activity of MK-8591 against HIV-2, we constructed a molecular model of HIV-2 RT with MK-8591-TP bound at the polymerase active site and compared the model to the published structure of the HIV-1 RT--MK-8591-TP complex (28) (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Approval for collection of data and patient samples for this study was obtained from the UW Institutional Review Board and Senegal ethics committee.","The manuscript describes the isolates and modeling work and references supplemental material and prior publications for some clone construction details, but there is no statement that sequences were deposited in public repositories (e.g., GenBank) nor are accession numbers provided. The absence of any accession numbers or explicit deposition statements within the provided text indicates sequences were not made publicly available as part of this paper."
28559249,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported in the paper.,"In the present study, we tested the activity of MK-8591 against a panel of HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains that were originally isolated from ART-naive individuals. A detailed description of the assay protocol has been provided elsewhere (32). Approval for collection of data and patient samples for this study was obtained from the UW Institutional Review Board and Senegal ethics committee.","No GenBank accession numbers or other sequence accession identifiers appear in the provided text. The paper discusses isolates and experimental methods but does not list any accession numbers, so there are no reported GenBank entries in this manuscript."
28559249,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,The paper tested 10 HIV-1 and 14 HIV-2 isolates (24 patient-derived strains total) in the single-cycle assays.,Susceptibility of HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates from ART-naive individuals to MK-8591. (A) EC50s for 10 HIV-1 and 14 HIV-2 strains. Bars are the means of results from three or more independent single-cycle assays. Other HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates from ART-naive individuals showed a similar trend with respect to MK-8591 susceptibility in the single-cycle assay (Fig. 3A).,"Figure 3A and the accompanying text state that EC50s were determined for 10 HIV-1 and 14 HIV-2 strains derived from ART-naive individuals. Although the paper does not explicitly say one strain equals one individual, the wording indicates these are distinct patient-derived isolates, so the best inference from the text is 24 individual-derived strains were tested."
28559249,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not specified; the only country explicitly mentioned in the paper with respect to sample collection oversight is Senegal (ethics committee).,"Approval for collection of data and patient samples for this study was obtained from the UW Institutional Review Board and Senegal ethics committee. HIV-2 is endemic in West Africa and is also prevalent in other areas with socioeconomic ties to the region (4, 5).","The manuscript does not list the countries of origin for the individual isolates. The only geographic detail in the provided text relating to specimen collection is the mention of the Senegal ethics committee, which suggests that at least some samples may have been collected in Senegal, but explicit provenance for each isolate or a full country list is not reported."
28559249,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not reported in the paper.,"In the present study, we tested the activity of MK-8591 against a panel of HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains that were originally isolated from ART-naive individuals. A detailed description of the assay protocol has been provided elsewhere (32).","The provided text contains no dates or years indicating when the isolates were obtained. Because the manuscript does not specify collection years for the patient-derived strains, the years are not reportable from the paper."
28559249,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,"Some viruses used in the study were derived from full-length plasmid molecular clones and a recombinant clone was constructed from a treated patient, but the paper does not report sequencing workflows or whether patient-derived samples were cloned specifically for sequencing.","We initially compared the ability of MK-8591 to inhibit two prototypic isolates derived from full-length plasmid molecular clones: HIV-1 NL4-3 and HIV-2 ROD9. We therefore examined the resistance profile of MK-8591 using a panel of site-directed HIV-2 ROD9 RT mutants and a recombinant clone of HIV-2 (designated 4.7a) that was derived from a patient receiving AZT, lamivudine (3TC), and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir; this clone encodes five amino acid substitutions that are associated with ART in HIV-2-infected individuals (RT changes K65R, N69S, V111I, Q151M, and M184V; see reference [32] for treatment history, clone construction, and additional details).","The manuscript clearly states that certain viruses used are laboratory molecular clones (NL4-3, ROD9) and that a patient-derived recombinant clone (4.7a) was constructed. However, because the paper does not describe sequencing procedures or state that patient-derived samples were cloned specifically prior to sequencing, the appropriate answer is that cloning was done for some experimental constructs but sequencing-related cloning is not described in this text."
28559249,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,The study focuses on reverse transcriptase (RT)/pol region changes; RT (a component of pol) is the gene region discussed.,"The HIV-2 intergroup recombinant 7312A encodes a group B pol gene (57). We therefore examined the resistance profile of MK-8591 using a panel of site-directed HIV-2 ROD9 RT mutants and a recombinant clone of HIV-2 (designated 4.7a) that was derived from a patient ... this clone encodes five amino acid substitutions that are associated with ART in HIV-2-infected individuals (RT changes K65R, N69S, V111I, Q151M, and M184V; see reference [32] for treatment history, clone construction, and additional details).","The manuscript repeatedly refers to RT mutations and the pol gene (which encodes RT), indicating that the genetic region of interest and effectively the sequenced/characterized region is RT/pol. No other HIV genes (e.g., env, gag, integrase) are described as being sequenced in the provided text."
28559249,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not reported in the paper.,"We therefore examined the resistance profile of MK-8591 using a panel of site-directed HIV-2 ROD9 RT mutants and a recombinant clone of HIV-2 (designated 4.7a) that was derived from a patient ... (see reference [32] for treatment history, clone construction, and additional details). A detailed description of the assay protocol has been provided elsewhere (32).","The provided manuscript text describes the construction of clones and site-directed mutants and refers to other publications for clone construction details, but it does not describe any sequencing methodology (e.g., Sanger sequencing, next-generation sequencing) used to obtain sequence data within this paper. Therefore the sequencing method cannot be determined from the text."
28559249,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,"Clinical isolates (patient-derived viral strains) and laboratory molecular/recombinant clones were used; the specific clinical specimen type (e.g., plasma, PBMC) is not specified.","In the present study, we tested the activity of MK-8591 against a panel of HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains that were originally isolated from ART-naive individuals. We initially compared the ability of MK-8591 to inhibit two prototypic isolates derived from full-length plasmid molecular clones: HIV-1 NL4-3 and HIV-2 ROD9. Approval for collection of data and patient samples for this study was obtained from the UW Institutional Review Board and Senegal ethics committee.","The text states that the viruses tested were isolates originating from patients (clinical isolates) and that molecular clones were also used. However, the manuscript does not specify the biological specimen type from which the viruses were obtained (for example plasma or peripheral blood mononuclear cells), so only 'patient-derived viral isolates and molecular clones' can be reported based on the content."
28559249,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"Yes — a recombinant clone (designated 4.7a) was derived from a patient receiving AZT, lamivudine (3TC), and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (i.e., treatment-experienced).","We therefore examined the resistance profile of MK-8591 using a panel of site-directed HIV-2 ROD9 RT mutants and a recombinant clone of HIV-2 (designated 4.7a) that was derived from a patient receiving AZT, lamivudine (3TC), and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir; this clone encodes five amino acid substitutions that are associated with ART in HIV-2-infected individuals (RT changes K65R, N69S, V111I, Q151M, and M184V; see reference [32] for treatment history, clone construction, and additional details). Mutations that are associated with NRTI treatment can have differing effects on drug susceptibility/resistance in HIV-1 versus HIV-2, as demonstrated for thymidine analog mutations and for the Q151M replacement in RT (29, -- 31).","The recombinant clone 4.7a is explicitly described as being derived from a patient receiving a three-drug antiretroviral regimen and encoding multiple RT substitutions associated with ART, which indicates that at least this sequence (or clone) originates from a treatment-experienced individual likely failing or having been exposed to therapy."
28559249,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No — there is no indication that the patients providing samples were enrolled in a clinical trial; sample collection was approved by institutional and national ethics committees.,"Approval for collection of data and patient samples for this study was obtained from the UW Institutional Review Board and Senegal ethics committee. In a phase 1b proof-of-concept clinical trial, a single 10-mg dose of MK-8591 demonstrated antiviral activity for 10 days in ART-naive, HIV-1-infected participants (22).","The paper mentions ethical approval for sample collection, but does not state that the sampled patients were participants in a clinical trial. The only clinical trial referenced pertains to a different study of MK-8591 in HIV-1-infected participants, not to the patient-derived isolates used here. Therefore the patients providing samples were not described as being in a clinical trial in this manuscript."
28559249,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"Yes — the recombinant clone 4.7a was derived from a patient receiving AZT, lamivudine (3TC), and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, indicating prior ARV exposure.","We therefore examined the resistance profile of MK-8591 using a panel of site-directed HIV-2 ROD9 RT mutants and a recombinant clone of HIV-2 (designated 4.7a) that was derived from a patient receiving AZT, lamivudine (3TC), and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir; this clone encodes five amino acid substitutions that are associated with ART in HIV-2-infected individuals (RT changes K65R, N69S, V111I, Q151M, and M184V; see reference [32] for treatment history, clone construction, and additional details).","The manuscript explicitly states that clone 4.7a originates from a patient on combination ARV therapy and that the clone harbors RT changes known to be associated with ART, so the paper includes viral material derived from an individual with prior ARV exposure."
28559249,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a protease inhibitor (boosted PI).,"We therefore examined the resistance profile of MK-8591 using ... a recombinant clone of HIV-2 (designated 4.7a) that was derived from a patient receiving AZT, lamivudine (3TC), and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir. Mutations that are associated with NRTI treatment can have differing effects on drug susceptibility/resistance in HIV-1 versus HIV-2.","AZT and lamivudine (3TC) are NRTIs, and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir is a protease inhibitor (PI) given with a pharmacokinetic booster. The text names these drugs directly, so the drug classes are derivable from those drug names."
28559249,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir.","We therefore examined the resistance profile of MK-8591 using ... a recombinant clone of HIV-2 (designated 4.7a) that was derived from a patient receiving AZT, lamivudine (3TC), and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir; this clone encodes five amino acid substitutions that are associated with ART in HIV-2-infected individuals (RT changes K65R, N69S, V111I, Q151M, and M184V; see reference [32] for treatment history, clone construction, and additional details).","The manuscript explicitly lists the three drugs associated with the patient-derived recombinant clone: AZT (zidovudine), lamivudine (3TC), and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, so these are the drugs known from the text to have been received by at least one individual whose virus was studied."
30053052,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes. The paper reports patient-derived HIV sequences used to create chimeric viruses and to clone RT genes.,"Stored plasma samples from patients who were either therapy naive (n = 42) or had a virological treatment failure (n = 9) were randomly selected from the HIV cohort at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Finally we obtained 24 replication-competent viruses from treatment-naive individuals ... whilst the viruses extracted from patients with therapy failure (n = 3) were HIV-1B (n = 1), HIV-1D (n = 1) and HIV-1C (n = 1), as determined by our previously published near full-length sequencing protocol.","The Methods/Clinical specimens section describes extraction of viral RNA from stored plasma samples, the recovery of replication-competent viruses from those patient samples, and use of a near full-length sequencing protocol to determine subtypes. These statements indicate that HIV sequences derived from patient samples were obtained and used in the study (for making chimeric viruses and downstream analyses)."
30053052,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,Yes. The paper reports both cell-based phenotypic drug susceptibility assays (ex vivo) and cell-free biochemical (in vitro) susceptibility/IC50 assays.,"The phenotypic drug susceptibility assay was performed using TZM-bl cells. In vitro biochemical assays targeting nevirapine, etravirine and rilpivirine identified subtype-specific differences, but this was not observed for efavirenz.","The Methods describe a phenotypic drug susceptibility assay (DSA) in TZM-bl cells and enzymatic PicoGreen-based assays to determine IC50 values for NNRTIs, and the Results present both ex vivo antiretroviral potency (EC50s from DSA) and in vitro biochemical IC50 data.

Ethics clearance for the study was obtained from the Regional Ethics Committee of Stockholm, Sweden (Dnr 2014/928-31/2 and 2013/1944-31/4).","The paper details specimen collection, sequencing methods and results (including sequence-based analyses and DRM listings) but contains no statements providing GenBank accession numbers or indicating deposition of sequences in a public repository. The absence of any accession numbers or explicit deposition statements implies sequences were not made publicly available (or at least not reported in the manuscript)."
30053052,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported. The paper does not provide any GenBank accession numbers.,"Finally we obtained 24 replication-competent viruses from treatment-naive individuals ... whilst the viruses extracted from patients with therapy failure (n = 3) were HIV-1B (n = 1), HIV-1D (n = 1) and HIV-1C (n = 1), as determined by our previously published near full-length sequencing protocol. The three viruses extracted from therapy-failure patients had the following mutations: HIV-1D, K65R, T69del, L100I, Y181C, Y188L, H221Y; HIV-1C, K65R, M184V, V108I, Y181C, G190S; HIV-1B, M41L, D67N, K70R, M184V, L210W, T215Y, K219E, K103S and G190A.","Although the manuscript lists sequence-derived mutation data and describes sequencing methods, it does not include any GenBank accession numbers or other public identifiers for the sequences, so no accession numbers can be reported from this paper."
30053052,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,51 individuals had stored plasma samples selected (42 therapy-naive and 9 with virological failure); sequencing/cloning yielded 24 replication-competent viruses from treatment-naive individuals and 3 from therapy-failure patients (27 replication-competent viruses total).,"Stored plasma samples from patients who were either therapy naive (n = 42) or had a virological treatment failure (n = 9) were randomly selected from the HIV cohort at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Finally we obtained 24 replication-competent viruses from treatment-naive individuals ... whilst the viruses extracted from patients with therapy failure (n = 3) were HIV-1B (n = 1), HIV-1D (n = 1) and HIV-1C (n = 1).","The Methods state that 42 therapy-naive and 9 therapy-failure patient plasma samples (total 51) were selected for the study. Due to cloning or functional virus recovery failures, the authors ultimately recovered 24 replication-competent viruses from treatment-naive individuals and 3 from therapy-failure individuals (27 sequences used for downstream chimeric virus experiments). Both the initial sample count and the final number of recovered replication-competent isolates are reported."
30053052,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Sweden (samples were from the HIV cohort at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden).","Stored plasma samples from patients who were either therapy naive (n = 42) or had a virological treatment failure (n = 9) were randomly selected from the HIV cohort at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.

Therefore the collection years cannot be determined from the manuscript."
30053052,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,"Yes. The gag-pol fragment was cloned into pNL43 to produce chimeric viruses, and RT genes were PCR-amplified and cloned for protein expression.","The gag-pol fragment (HXB2: 0702-5798) was cloned into pNL43 plasmid following digestion with BssHII and SalI (New England Biolabs, USA) and ligation using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs), as described by us previously. The RT genes of different subtypes were PCR amplified from DNA amplicons of viruses isolated from patients infected with diverse subtypes. For the cloning of the p66 subunit, NcoI and SalI restriction sites were added ... The p66 subunit was cloned in the pCDFDuet-1 vector ...",The Methods clearly describe molecular cloning steps: amplification and cloning of patient-derived gag-pol into pNL43 to make chimeric viruses and PCR amplification/cloning of RT genes into expression vectors. These cloning steps indicate that samples (or their PCR products) were cloned as part of the workflow prior to downstream analyses.
30053052,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,gag-pol (HXB2 coordinates 0702-5798) was cloned and used; RT genes (part of pol) were specifically PCR-amplified and cloned for enzymatic assays. A previously published near full-length sequencing protocol was also referenced.,The gag-pol fragment (HXB2: 0702-5798) was cloned into pNL43 plasmid ... The RT genes of different subtypes were PCR amplified from DNA amplicons of viruses isolated from patients infected with diverse subtypes. ... as determined by our previously published near full-length sequencing protocol.,"The paper states that gag-pol fragments were cloned (covering gag and pol regions) and RT genes were PCR-amplified and cloned for expression and biochemical assays. Additionally, subtype assignments were determined by a previously published near full-length sequencing protocol, indicating sequencing of near full-length viral genomes in earlier work or as part of their approach."
30053052,10,What method was used for sequencing?,"Not explicitly specified.

The RT genes of different subtypes were PCR amplified from DNA amplicons of viruses isolated from patients infected with diverse subtypes.,"Although the manuscript refers to a near full-length sequencing protocol and details PCR amplification and cloning steps, it does not specify the sequencing technology or method (for example, Sanger sequencing or next-generation sequencing) used to generate nucleotide sequence reads. Therefore the exact sequencing method cannot be determined from the text."
30053052,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma samples (viral RNA extracted from plasma) were used to obtain sequences and produce chimeric viruses.,"Stored plasma samples from patients who were either therapy naive (n = 42) or had a virological treatment failure (n = 9) were randomly selected from the HIV cohort at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Briefly, viral RNA was extracted using the QIAmp viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) from 140 µL of plasma.","The Methods explicitly state that stored plasma samples were the clinical material used and that viral RNA was extracted from plasma for downstream cloning and sequencing, indicating plasma as the source sample type."
30053052,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"Yes. Sequences (replication-competent viruses) were obtained from three patients with virological treatment failure, and those isolates harbored resistance mutations.","Stored plasma samples from patients who were either therapy naive (n = 42) or had a virological treatment failure (n = 9) were randomly selected ... Finally we obtained 24 replication-competent viruses from treatment-naive individuals ... whilst the viruses extracted from patients with therapy failure (n = 3) were HIV-1B (n = 1), HIV-1D (n = 1) and HIV-1C (n = 1). The three viruses extracted from therapy-failure patients had the following mutations: HIV-1D, K65R, T69del, L100I, Y181C, Y188L, H221Y; HIV-1C, K65R, M184V, V108I, Y181C, G190S; HIV-1B, M41L, D67N, K70R, M184V, L210W, T215Y, K219E, K103S and G190A.","The Clinical specimens and Results sections state that among the selected samples, three replication-competent viruses were recovered from therapy-failure patients and list specific drug resistance mutations for those isolates, confirming sequences were obtained from individuals experiencing virological failure."
30053052,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No. The patients were sampled from an HIV cohort at Karolinska University Hospital; there is no indication that they were participants in a clinical trial.,"Stored plasma samples from patients who were either therapy naive (n = 42) or had a virological treatment failure (n = 9) were randomly selected from the HIV cohort at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Ethics clearance for the study was obtained from the Regional Ethics Committee of Stockholm, Sweden ... All participants gave informed consent.","The manuscript describes selection of samples from a clinical cohort and reports ethics approval and informed consent, but does not describe enrollment of these participants in any clinical trial. Discussion references the EARNEST trial in a broader context, but that is unrelated to the cohort used here."
30053052,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"Yes. Sequences were obtained from individuals with virological treatment failure (i.e., previously treated), and those isolates contained resistance mutations consistent with prior ARV exposure.","Stored plasma samples from patients who were either therapy naive (n = 42) or had a virological treatment failure (n = 9) were randomly selected ... whilst the viruses extracted from patients with therapy failure (n = 3) were HIV-1B (n = 1), HIV-1D (n = 1) and HIV-1C (n = 1). The three viruses extracted from therapy-failure patients had the following mutations: HIV-1D, K65R, T69del, L100I, Y181C, Y188L, H221Y; HIV-1C, K65R, M184V, V108I, Y181C, G190S; HIV-1B, M41L, D67N, K70R, M184V, L210W, T215Y, K219E, K103S and G190A.","The presence of therapy-failure patients and the documented drug resistance mutations (e.g., K65R, M184V, TAMs, NNRTI-associated mutations) indicate these individuals had prior ARV exposure, and the study includes sequences derived from those individuals."
30053052,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,The paper implies prior exposure to NRTIs and NNRTIs based on the detected resistance mutations; specific class exposure is not explicitly listed for each patient.,"The three viruses extracted from therapy-failure patients had the following mutations: HIV-1D, K65R, T69del, L100I, Y181C, Y188L, H221Y; HIV-1C, K65R, M184V, V108I, Y181C, G190S; HIV-1B, M41L, D67N, K70R, M184V, L210W, T215Y, K219E, K103S and G190A. The genotypic resistance prediction in the Stanford HIV drug resistance database identified all the strains as intermediate- to high-level resistant to all NRTIs except zidovudine and NNRTIs.","The mutation patterns and the genotypic resistance predictions indicate resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). While the paper does not enumerate the patients' actual prior drug regimens, the resistance-associated mutations are characteristic of prior NRTI and NNRTI exposure, so those classes are implicated."
30053052,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not explicitly reported. The manuscript does not list the specific antiretroviral drugs taken by patients; based on resistance mutations, likely exposures include NRTIs such as tenofovir and lamivudine/emtricitabine and NNRTIs such as efavirenz or nevirapine, but these are inferred rather than stated.","The three viruses extracted from therapy-failure patients had the following mutations: HIV-1D, K65R, T69del, L100I, Y181C, Y188L, H221Y; HIV-1C, K65R, M184V, V108I, Y181C, G190S; HIV-1B, M41L, D67N, K70R, M184V, L210W, T215Y, K219E, K103S and G190A. The genotypic resistance prediction in the Stanford HIV drug resistance database identified all the strains as intermediate- to high-level resistant to all NRTIs except zidovudine and NNRTIs.","The paper provides mutation profiles and resistance predictions but does not provide patient treatment histories listing specific drugs. Mutations such as K65R and M184V commonly arise with tenofovir and lamivudine/emtricitabine exposure respectively, and K103S/K103N, Y181C, G190A/S are associated with NNRTI exposure (efavirenz/nevirapine), so these drugs are plausible prior treatments, but this is inference from genotypes rather than explicit medication records in the manuscript."

33855437,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No evidence of cloning prior to sequencing was reported.,"Viral isolates were serially passaged in cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) in the presence of escalating concentrations of doravirine and rilpivirine alone or paired with islatravir or lamivudine (3TC) as described previously. Viral RNA was extracted, and genotypic analyses of all clinical isolates was performed at weeks 8 and 24 of selective drug pressure to evaluate the monitor the acquisition and accumulation of amino acid substitutions (i.e. drug resistance mutations).","The Methods describe passage in CBMCs, storage of culture supernatant, RNA extraction and genotypic analyses, but they do not mention cloning (e.g., molecular cloning of PCR products or cloning into vectors) prior to sequencing, so there is no evidence that samples were cloned."
33855437,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"The reverse transcriptase (RT) region of pol (RT) was analyzed (i.e., RT-associated drug resistance mutations).","Briefly, stepwise drug-dose escalations from the half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50 values) were performed based on weekly reverse transcriptase (RT) assays that determined the extent of viral inhibition of drug-treated samples as compared with matching no-drug controls for wild-type isolates. Viral RNA was extracted, and genotypic analyses of all clinical isolates was performed at weeks 8 and 24 of selective drug pressure to evaluate the monitor the acquisition and accumulation of amino acid substitutions (i.e. drug resistance mutations).","The study focuses on NNRTI resistance and repeatedly references RT assays and RT-associated mutations (e.g., M184V, V106M, V108I), indicating that sequencing/genotypic analysis targeted the reverse transcriptase portion of the pol gene."
33855437,10,What method was used for sequencing?,"Genotypic analyses of viral RNA were performed, but the paper does not specify the sequencing technology or platform (e.g., Sanger vs. NGS).","Viral RNA was extracted, and genotypic analyses of all clinical isolates was performed at weeks 8 and 24 of selective drug pressure to evaluate the monitor the acquisition and accumulation of amino acid substitutions (i.e. drug resistance mutations). Resistant viruses were amplified from stored cell culture supernatants at designated weeks (8, 13, 17, 24 or 30) following in vitro selection with doravirine or rilpivirine and re-genotyped.","While the Methods describe extraction of viral RNA, amplification and genotypic analyses/re‑genotyping, they do not specify the sequencing method or platform; therefore only 'genotypic analysis' is reported."
33855437,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Viral RNA from patient-derived clinical isolates propagated in cell culture; RNA was extracted from stored cell culture supernatants following serial passage in cord blood mononuclear cells.,"Patient-derived subtype B (n = 3) and non-B clinical isolates (n = 3), as well as the HIV NL4.3 recombinant clone were subjected to in vitro cell culture selections to ascertain emergent resistance to doravirine and rilpivirine. At each weekly passage, an aliquot of culture supernatant was stored at −70°C for subsequent genotypic and phenotypic analyses.","The Methods indicate that patient-derived viral isolates were serially passaged in CBMCs and that viral RNA was extracted from stored culture supernatants for genotypic analyses, so the sequenced material was viral RNA from cultured virus (culture supernatant)."
33855437,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No clear evidence of sequencing from individuals with virological failure on treatment; most patient-derived isolates were from drug‑naive individuals, though one isolate (96USSN20) had baseline thymidine-analogue mutations.","Isolates 14637, 14969, 5326 and 6343 ... were derived from drug-naive individuals at Clinique Actuel obtained with ethics approval (Veritas) and informed consent.

31988104,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes. The study used patient-derived HIV isolates (patient samples) to generate viruses for phenotypic testing.,"Recombinant mutant HIV-1 viruses were created either by site directed mutagenesis (SDM) of wild-type HIV-1 DNA, or by direct PCR of ART-experienced patient isolates (8). A total of 68 viruses with various levels of TAF/TDF resistance and various numbers of TAMs were used in the viral breakthrough experiments (54 SDMs and 14 patient-derived isolates).","The Methods state that viral constructs were created either by SDM or by direct PCR of ART-experienced patient isolates, and the Results repeatedly refer to 14 patient-derived isolates used in experiments. This indicates that HIV from patient samples (patient-derived isolates) was used in the study."
31988104,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,Yes. The paper reports extensive in vitro phenotypic drug susceptibility data (EC50 fold-changes and viral breakthrough assays).,The susceptibilities to antiviral drugs of site-directed mutants (SDMs) and patient-derived mutants containing combinations of TAMs ... were evaluated using either 5-day multicycle (MC; n = 110) or 2-day single-cycle (SC; n = 96) HIV assays.

Clinical validation of the higher resistance threshold for TAF compared to TDF has not been established, since doing so would knowingly put participants at risk of virologic failure and would be inconsistent with the current standard of care.",The text describes in vitro experiments and explicitly states that clinical validation has not been established; it also treats separate clinical trials as distinct studies. There is no indication that the patient-derived isolates used here were from participants enrolled in a clinical trial for this study.
31988104,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes. The paper explicitly states that patient-derived isolates were from ART-experienced individuals.,"Recombinant mutant HIV-1 viruses were created either by site directed mutagenesis (SDM) of wild-type HIV-1 DNA, or by direct PCR of ART-experienced patient isolates (8). Resistance levels were higher for patient-derived viruses compared to SDMs, likely as a result of the choice of samples used to generate the patient-derived isolates, most of which containing TAMs associated with higher levels of resistance to TFV (M41L, L210W, and T215Y).","The Methods label the patient-derived material as 'ART-experienced patient isolates' and note presence of treatment-associated mutations (TAMs), indicating those individuals had prior antiretroviral exposure."
31988104,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not explicitly reported. The paper does not list prior treatment regimens by drug class for the donors, though the mutations studied (TAMs and M184V) indicate prior exposure to NRTIs (thymidine analogs and 3TC/FTC).","DNA fragments containing most combinations of the most frequent TAMs (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y, and K219Q in RT) with or without the M184V RT mutation were generated by SDM and cloned into both pKSHX and pXXLAI plasmids (Genewiz, South Plainfield, NJ) (see the supplemental material). Multicycle phenotypic EC50 assays with NRTIs and control compounds were performed on SDMs and patient-derived clinical isolates.","Although specific prior drug classes for the individual donors are not listed, the focus on TAMs and M184V (mutations associated with thymidine analogs and lamivudine/emtricitabine respectively) implies prior NRTI exposure; however the authors do not explicitly report the patients' prior drug classes."
31988104,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not specified. The manuscript does not report individual patients' prior drugs; based on the mutations present (TAMs and M184V), donors likely received thymidine analog NRTIs (e.g., AZT/d4T) and 3TC/emtricitabine, but this is an inference, not explicitly stated.","DNA fragments containing most combinations of the most frequent TAMs (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y, and K219Q in RT) with or without the M184V RT mutation were generated by SDM and cloned into both pKSHX and pXXLAI plasmids (Genewiz, South Plainfield, NJ) (see the supplemental material). Resistance levels were higher for patient-derived viruses compared to SDMs, likely as a result of the choice of samples used to generate the patient-derived isolates, most of which containing TAMs associated with higher levels of resistance to TFV (M41L, L210W, and T215Y).","The manuscript gives no patient-level treatment histories or drug lists. The presence of TAMs and M184V is consistent with prior exposure to thymidine analog NRTIs and lamivudine/emtricitabine, but this is inferred from mutation patterns rather than documented treatment records in the paper."
34516245,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,"No. The paper reports sequences derived from laboratory virus stocks and cell culture passaging, not from patient samples.","Serial passages were initiated by infecting MT-2 cells with WT (xxLAI), K65R, M184V, or D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q stock virus in the presence of EFdA and monitored as described in Materials and Methods. Initial K65R, M184V, and D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q viruses were generated by site-directed mutagenesis on an xxLAI HIV-1 backbone. Viral RNA was purified from supernatants using the QIAamp Viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) ... and 500 ng was used as the template for cDNA synthesis.","The methods and results repeatedly describe generation of viruses by site-directed mutagenesis and propagation in cell lines (MT-2) with sequencing performed on viral RNA from culture supernatants and PCR products. There is no mention of clinical participants, patient-derived plasma, or patient sample collection, so the sequences are from in vitro lab/cell-culture sources rather than patient samples."
34516245,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,"Yes. The paper reports in vitro dose-response and EC50 data for EFdA and susceptibility testing against TDF and FTC, as well as in vitro biochemical assays.","To evaluate the degree of resistance selected in the passaging experiments, sensitivity to EFdA was determined for virus supernatants from passage 6 onward. To determine whether the various EFdA resistance mutations are susceptible to approved drugs such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC), we prepared dose-response curves (Table 2). Steady-state kinetic parameters, Km, for the incorporation of dNTPs were determined using plate-based assays ...","The Results and Methods describe multiple in vitro susceptibility experiments: EFdA dose-response curves/EC50 determinations on passaged viruses and molecular clones, dose-response curves for TDF and FTC, and biochemical steady-state kinetics assays. These are standard in vitro susceptibility and biochemical assays reported in the paper."
34516245,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,Yes. Mutation sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers OK263149 to OK263162.,Data availability. Mutation sequences for BankIt2501100 Seq1 to Seq14 have been deposited in GenBank under accession no. OK263149 to OK263162.,"The Data availability statement explicitly states that the mutation sequences were submitted to GenBank and provides the accession range, indicating public deposition of the sequence data."
34516245,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,OK263149 to OK263162.,Data availability. Mutation sequences for BankIt2501100 Seq1 to Seq14 have been deposited in GenBank under accession no. OK263149 to OK263162.,The Data availability section lists the exact GenBank accession numbers (OK263149 through OK263162) for the submitted sequence entries.
34516245,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,None—no human individuals; sequencing was performed on laboratory virus stocks and cell-culture-derived material.,"Initial K65R, M184V, and D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q viruses were generated by site-directed mutagenesis on an xxLAI HIV-1 backbone. Serial passages were initiated by infecting MT-2 cells with WT (xxLAI), K65R, M184V, or D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q stock virus in the presence of EFdA and monitored as described in Materials and Methods.","All sequencing described was performed on viruses produced or passaged in vitro (site-directed mutants and culture supernatants). There is no description of patient enrollment, clinical sampling, or sequencing of patient-derived specimens, so zero human individuals provided samples for sequencing in this study."
34516245,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable / Not reported. The sequences derive from laboratory viruses and cell culture; no country-of-origin for patient samples is provided.,"Initial K65R, M184V, and D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q viruses were generated by site-directed mutagenesis on an xxLAI HIV-1 backbone. Viral RNA was purified from supernatants using the QIAamp Viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) ... and 500 ng was used as the template for cDNA synthesis.","Because the work used laboratory-generated and passaged viruses rather than clinical specimens, there is no country attribution for sequenced samples; the manuscript does not report any country-of-origin information for patient-derived samples."
34516245,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Not reported / Not applicable. The manuscript does not provide collection years for sequences, as they derive from in vitro experiments rather than dated patient samples.","Serial passages were initiated by infecting MT-2 cells with WT (xxLAI), K65R, M184V, or D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q stock virus in the presence of EFdA and monitored as described in Materials and Methods. Data availability. Mutation sequences for BankIt2501100 Seq1 to Seq14 have been deposited in GenBank under accession no. OK263149 to OK263162.",The paper describes experimental passages and sequencing but does not state calendar years when the laboratory samples were collected or sequenced; therefore no collection years are reported.
34516245,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,"Yes. PCR products spanning the full-length reverse transcriptase were cloned into pGEM-T and individual clones were sequenced (clonal sequencing), in addition to population sequencing.","Clonal sequencing of full-length reverse transcriptase gene PCR products. Approximately 105 ng of full-length PCR product was ligated into the pGEM-T vector system (Promega) ... A minimum of 20 clones from each sample were sequenced. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, and the 2,127-bp band was harvested ... and 500 ng of sample was submitted to ACGT, Inc. (Wheeling, IL), for full-length, double-stranded population sequencing.",The Methods explicitly describe two sequencing approaches: population sequencing of PCR products submitted to a sequencing service and clonal sequencing after ligation into pGEM-T and sequencing of individual plasmid clones (minimum 20 clones per sample). This confirms samples were cloned for clonal sequencing.
34516245,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,The full-length reverse transcriptase (RT) gene was sequenced (PCR product spanning RT).,"These primers anneal to the 3′ end of gag and the 5′ end of integrase, respectively, and generate a 2,127-bp product spanning the full length of the reverse transcriptase gene. Clonal sequencing of full-length reverse transcriptase gene PCR products.","The primers used amplify a 2,127-bp fragment that spans the full-length RT gene, and clonal and population sequencing were performed on that RT PCR product; no other HIV genes are described as being sequenced in the Methods or Results."
34516245,10,What method was used for sequencing?,"Sanger population sequencing of PCR products (submitted to ACGT, Inc.) and clonal Sanger sequencing of pGEM-T plasmid inserts (sequencing of individual clones).","PCR products ... and 500 ng of sample was submitted to ACGT, Inc. (Wheeling, IL), for full-length, double-stranded population sequencing. Approximately 105 ng of full-length PCR product was ligated into the pGEM-T vector system (Promega) ... A minimum of 20 clones from each sample were sequenced.","The manuscript describes submission of PCR products for full-length double-stranded population sequencing (typical Sanger service) and cloning of PCR products followed by sequencing of individual plasmid clones, indicating conventional Sanger-based population and clonal sequencing approaches were used."
34516245,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Viral RNA purified from cell-culture supernatants (from MT-2 cell passages) was reverse-transcribed and PCR-amplified; PCR products and cloned plasmid inserts were sequenced.,"Viral RNA was purified from supernatants using the QIAamp Viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) ... and 500 ng was used as the template for cDNA synthesis. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, and the 2,127-bp band was harvested ... 500 ng of sample was submitted to ACGT, Inc. for full-length, double-stranded population sequencing. Approximately 105 ng of full-length PCR product was ligated into the pGEM-T vector system ... and a minimum of 20 clones from each sample were sequenced.",The methods indicate sequencing was performed on RT-PCR products derived from viral RNA isolated from culture supernatants; these PCR products were both directly population-sequenced and cloned into plasmids for clonal sequencing.
34516245,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No. The sequences were derived from laboratory-generated and passaged viruses, not from patients experiencing virological failure on treatment.","Serial passages were initiated by infecting MT-2 cells with WT (xxLAI), K65R, M184V, or D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q stock virus in the presence of EFdA and monitored as described in Materials and Methods. Initial K65R, M184V, and D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q viruses were generated by site-directed mutagenesis on an xxLAI HIV-1 backbone.",All sequencing and resistance-selection experiments were performed in vitro using engineered or laboratory virus stocks and cell culture passage; there is no mention of sequencing viruses from treated patients with virological failure.
34516245,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No. There were no patients in this study and no clinical trial involvement; the work was laboratory-based.,"Initial K65R, M184V, and D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q viruses were generated by site-directed mutagenesis on an xxLAI HIV-1 backbone. Serial passages were initiated by infecting MT-2 cells with WT (xxLAI), K65R, M184V, or D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q stock virus in the presence of EFdA and monitored as described in Materials and Methods.","The manuscript describes in vitro experiments using cell lines and engineered viruses and contains no description of patient enrollment, clinical trial protocols, or human subject research; therefore, no patients in a clinical trial were involved."
34516245,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"No. The sequences are from lab-generated or passaged viruses; while some starting viruses carried resistance-associated mutations (e.g., K65R, M184V, AZT-resistance mutations), these were engineered or defined laboratory strains, not sequences from treated individuals.","Initial K65R, M184V, and D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q viruses were generated by site-directed mutagenesis on an xxLAI HIV-1 backbone. Passage of the D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q virus led to the rapid emergence of M184V (dominant in passage 6).","Although the study used viruses with resistance-associated genotypes (to model NRTI-resistant backgrounds), these were created by mutagenesis or are laboratory strains; the paper does not report sequencing of viruses from patients with prior ARV exposure."
34516245,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not applicable; no human individuals provided samples. The study did use viruses carrying nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-associated mutations (e.g., K65R, M184V, AZT-resistance mutations) for in vitro experiments.","To study EFdA resistance patterns that may emerge in naive or tenofovir (TFV)-, emtricitabine/lamivudine (FTC/3TC)-, or zidovudine (AZT)-treated patients, we performed viral passaging experiments starting with WT, K65R, M184V, or D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q HIV-1. K65R is the mutation responsible for virological failure in TFV-based therapies. M184V confers high-level resistance to both 3TC and FTC.","No individuals were sampled; however, the study modeled prior ARV exposure using lab strains carrying NRTI-associated mutations (TFV/TDF-related K65R, FTC/3TC-related M184V, AZT-resistance mutations). Thus, the relevant drug class modeled is NRTIs, but there were no human-treated individuals in the study."
34516245,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not applicable; no human individuals. The study modeled resistance to tenofovir (TFV/TDF), emtricitabine/lamivudine (FTC/3TC), and zidovudine (AZT) by using viruses with associated resistance mutations.","To study EFdA resistance patterns that may emerge in naive or tenofovir (TFV)-, emtricitabine/lamivudine (FTC/3TC)-, or zidovudine (AZT)-treated patients, we performed viral passaging experiments starting with WT, K65R, M184V, or D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q HIV-1. K65R is the mutation responsible for virological failure in TFV-based therapies. M184V confers high-level resistance to both 3TC and FTC.","There were no patient-derived samples; nonetheless, the manuscript specifically models resistance backgrounds associated with TFV/TDF, FTC/3TC, and AZT by using lab viruses harboring K65R, M184V, and AZT-resistance mutations, respectively. Therefore, those drugs are the ones modeled, but not actually received by study participants."
35913500,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,No. The paper does not report HIV sequence data or sequence alignments from patient samples; it reports clinical resistance testing results (a detected mutation) but provides no sequence files or sequence data.,"Consideration of the FDA-approved 8-week dosing interval requires demonstration of sustained viral suppression for 6 months with every 4-week dosing based on data from the antiretroviral therapy as long acting suppression (ATLAS) 2-M study [25, 35], which found that confirmed virologic failure (CVF) occurred most commonly early in the 8-week arm (7 of 8 participants with CVF failed in the first 24 weeks). Of 15 patients who started with detectable viremia, (median CD4 cell count, 99 cells/mm3; mean log10 viral load, 4.67 with standard deviation 1.16), all DTI with a median of 6 injections (range 3–11,), 12 (80%; 95% CI, 55%–93%) had achieved and maintained viral suppression, including the patient with the baseline N155H mutation.","The manuscript describes clinical care outcomes, viral load monitoring, and mentions that resistance testing is performed in certain circumstances and reports a detected resistance mutation (N155H) in one patient. However, there is no mention anywhere in the text of sequencing reads, sequence files, sequence alignments, or presentation of nucleotide/amino-acid sequences; no methodological details for sequencing nor any sequence outputs are provided. Therefore the paper does not report HIV sequences from patient samples."
35913500,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No. The paper does not report any in vitro phenotypic drug susceptibility assays or results.,"For patients who start without viral suppression, an HIV viral load is repeated every 4 weeks until it is below the lower limit of detection for our laboratory’s assay (<30 copies/mL), with resistance testing performed at the second injection visit if the viral load remains detectable. One patient had an N155H resistance mutation at baseline.","The methods and results describe clinical viral load monitoring and genotypic resistance testing (identification of a mutation) but do not mention laboratory phenotypic assays (in vitro susceptibility testing) such as fold-change phenotypic assays or phenotyping platforms. Because no phenotypic assay methods or results are reported, there are no in vitro drug susceptibility data in this paper."
35913500,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No. The paper does not indicate that any HIV sequences were deposited in public repositories.,"Patients with any history of RPV-associated resistance mutations are not considered for CAB/RPV-LA [31]; however, the program allows 61 integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) mutation [23625, 32]. One patient had an N155H resistance mutation at baseline.","Although the manuscript references genotypic resistance findings (e.g., reporting an N155H mutation), it does not include any statements about depositing sequence data in GenBank or other public databases, nor does it list accession numbers. The absence of accession numbers or deposition statements indicates sequences were not made publicly available as part of this publication."
35913500,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported. No GenBank accession numbers are provided in the paper.,"Of 15 patients who started with detectable viremia, (median CD4 cell count, 99 cells/mm3; mean log10 viral load, 4.67 with standard deviation 1.16), all DTI with a median of 6 injections (range 3611,), 12 (80%; 95% CI, 55%693%) had achieved and maintained viral suppression, including the patient with the baseline N155H mutation. The University of California63San Francisco Institutional Review Board approved the study.",The paper reports clinical and genotypic resistance findings but does not present any sequence accession numbers or indicate sequence deposition. Therefore no GenBank accession numbers are associated with this study.
35913500,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Not applicable / none reported. The paper does not report HIV sequencing of samples; it reports clinical resistance testing in routine care but does not specify sequencing sample counts.,"For patients who start without viral suppression, an HIV viral load is repeated every 4 weeks until it is below the lower limit of detection for our laboratory63s assay (<30 copies/mL), with resistance testing performed at the second injection visit if the viral load remains detectable. Of 51 patients who received injections between June 2021 and April 2022, our analytic sample with at least 2 follow-up injections consisted of 39 patients (Table 1).","The study describes when clinical resistance testing is performed (for persistent viremia) but does not describe sequencing workflows or provide counts of samples sequenced. Because no sequencing is reported, the question of how many individuals had samples obtained for sequencing cannot be answered from the manuscript and should be considered not applicable."
35913500,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Not applicable for sequencing. The clinical population was drawn from a single clinic in the United States (San Francisco, California, USA).","Ward 86 is one of the oldest HIV clinics in the United States and the safety-net HIV clinic for the city and county of San Francisco. The clinic serves more than 2400 PWH aged 618 years (85% cisgender men, 13% cisgender women, 2% transgender women and men, 21% Black, 27% Hispanic) who have government insurance (ie, Medicaid, Medicare) or are covered through a municipal program for uninsured San Francisco residents.","Although the study did not perform or report sequencing, the patient population is clearly based at Ward 86 in San Francisco, USA. Therefore if any samples had been sequenced they would have come from patients in the United States (San Francisco). The paper contains no information on samples from other countries."
35913500,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable for sequencing. Clinic data and samples (for viral loads/resistance testing) were obtained during 202162022 (referrals from Feb 2021 and injections between June 2021 and April 2022).,"Between 1 February 2021 and 15 April 2022, providers referred 132 patients, of whom 51 were started on injections. Of 51 patients who received injections between June 2021 and April 2022, our analytic sample with at least 2 follow-up injections consisted of 39 patients (Table 1).","The study timeframe for referrals and injection initiation is explicitly given as Feb 2021 through April 2022, with injections occurring between June 2021 and April 2022. Although no sequencing dates are provided (because sequencing was not reported), any resistance testing or samples referenced were collected in that 202162022 window."
35913500,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,"No. There is no report of cloning of samples prior to sequencing; in fact, no sequencing was reported.","For patients who start without viral suppression, an HIV viral load is repeated every 4 weeks until it is below the lower limit of detection for our laboratory63s assay (<30 copies/mL), with resistance testing performed at the second injection visit if the viral load remains detectable. Patients with any history of RPV-associated resistance mutations are not considered for CAB/RPV-LA [31]; however, the program allows 61 integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) mutation [23625, 32].","The manuscript does not describe any laboratory sequencing methods, including cloning or single-genome amplification. It only references clinical resistance testing results and criteria. Therefore there is no evidence that samples were cloned prior to sequencing."
35913500,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Not explicitly reported. The manuscript reports detection of an N155H mutation (an integrase mutation) and references RPV-associated resistance (rilpivirine, an NNRTI affecting reverse transcriptase), implying assessment of integrase and reverse transcriptase regions, but no genes are explicitly stated as sequenced.","Patients with any history of RPV-associated resistance mutations are not considered for CAB/RPV-LA [31]; however, the program allows 61 integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) mutation [23625, 32]. One patient had an N155H resistance mutation at baseline.","The paper mentions a detected N155H mutation (an integrase gene mutation) and discusses RPV-associated resistance mutations (rilpivirine targets reverse transcriptase). This implies that genotypic resistance testing targeted integrase and reverse transcriptase regions, but the authors do not explicitly state which genes were sequenced or provide sequencing methodology or gene lists. Thus the best-supported inference is that integrase and reverse transcriptase regions were assessed."
35913500,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not reported. The paper does not describe any sequencing methods.,"For patients who start without viral suppression, an HIV viral load is repeated every 4 weeks until it is below the lower limit of detection for our laboratory63s assay (<30 copies/mL), with resistance testing performed at the second injection visit if the viral load remains detectable. The University of California63San Francisco Institutional Review Board approved the study.","Although the manuscript references clinical resistance testing, it provides no laboratory methods or technical details about sequencing platforms, PCR, Sanger sequencing, or next-generation sequencing. Therefore the sequencing method is not reported."
35913500,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,"Not explicitly stated as 'sequenced.' Clinical viral load testing and resistance testing were performed on blood draws (plasma), so sample type for resistance testing would be patient blood/plasma.","For patients who start without viral suppression, an HIV viral load is repeated every 4 weeks until it is below the lower limit of detection for our laboratory63s assay (<30 copies/mL), with resistance testing performed at the second injection visit if the viral load remains detectable. If an injection is delayed by 10 days or more, blood work for resistance testing is obtained in addition to viral load testing.","The manuscript indicates that viral loads and resistance testing are done via blood work. While no sequencing is described, the sample type used for those clinical assays is blood/plasma, so blood-derived plasma would be the specimen for any genotypic resistance testing performed as part of the clinical care described."
35913500,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"Yes in the sense that clinical resistance testing detected a mutation in a viremic patient (one patient had the N155H mutation at baseline), but the paper does not provide sequence data files.","Of 15 patients who started with detectable viremia, (median CD4 cell count, 99 cells/mm3; mean log10 viral load, 4.67 with standard deviation 1.16), all DTI with a median of 6 injections (range 3611,), 12 (80%; 95% CI, 55%693%) had achieved and maintained viral suppression, including the patient with the baseline N155H mutation. Patients with any history of RPV-associated resistance mutations are not considered for CAB/RPV-LA [31]; however, the program allows 61 integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) mutation [23625, 32].","The study reports that several patients initiated injections with detectable viremia (i.e., virologic failure) and that one patient had a baseline N155H integrase resistance mutation. That indicates genotypic resistance was identified in a patient with virologic failure. However, the paper does not present sequence files or accession numbers."
35913500,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No. This was a clinical demonstration project conducted in routine care, not a clinical trial.","Here, we describe the first demonstration project to our knowledge to use CBV/RPV-LA in patients with challenges adhering to oral ART. Our data demonstrate preliminary short-term effectiveness of using every 4-week CAB/RPV-LA in patients with and without viral suppression in a diverse urban clinic that serves publicly insured patients with high levels of marginal housing and stimulant use.","The authors repeatedly characterize the work as a 'demonstration project' and contrast their experience with clinical trial populations, indicating this was programmatic implementation in a real-world clinic (Ward 86), not a controlled clinical trial."
35913500,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"Indirectly yes: the paper reports a detected resistance mutation (N155H) in a patient who was treatment experienced, but it does not provide sequence data.","Two of these patients, both of whom were people with HIV for more than 10 years, had never previously been virally suppressed, including the patient with the baseline N155H mutation who has now demonstrated >8 months of viral suppression. Patients with any history of RPV-associated resistance mutations are not considered for CAB/RPV-LA [31]; however, the program allows 61 integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) mutation [23625, 32].","Many participants were treatment experienced; the manuscript explicitly notes long-term HIV infection and reports a baseline integrase resistance mutation in a patient who had prior ARV exposure. Although no sequence files are provided, the report includes genotypic resistance information from a previously treated individual."
35913500,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Reported or implied drug classes include integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs, e.g., rilpivirine), and nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs, e.g., tenofovir/emtricitabine).","Patients with any history of RPV-associated resistance mutations are not considered for CAB/RPV-LA [31]; however, the program allows 61 integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) mutation [23625, 32]. No cases of hepatitis B viremia were observed with discontinuation of tenofovir/emtricitabine-containing regimens, although we did not systematically measure hepatitis B DNA levels in our cohort.",The manuscript references rilpivirine-associated (RPV) resistance and integrase mutations (INDICATING NNRTI and INSTI exposure/concern) and explicitly mentions tenofovir/emtricitabine-containing regimens (NRTIs). These references indicate that study participants had prior exposure to these drug classes in their ARV histories.
35913500,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Specifically mentioned drugs include cabotegravir and rilpivirine (the long-acting regimen studied, CAB/RPV-LA) and oral tenofovir/emtricitabine-containing regimens; prior exposure to rilpivirine and INSTI-class drugs is discussed conceptually (e.g., RPV-associated resistance, N155H integrase mutation).","We developed a program to support patients and providers to initiate CAB/RPV-LA and to promote patient adherence to injections. Patients with any history of RPV-associated resistance mutations are not considered for CAB/RPV-LA [31]; ... One patient had an N155H resistance mutation at baseline. No cases of hepatitis B viremia were observed with discontinuation of tenofovir/emtricitabine-containing regimens, although we did not systematically measure hepatitis B DNA levels in our cohort.","The intervention was cabotegravir/rilpivirine long-acting injections (CAB/RPV-LA). The manuscript also mentions tenofovir/emtricitabine as a component of prior oral regimens and discusses rilpivirine-associated and integrase resistance, indicating prior use or concern for those agents/classes. The paper does not provide a comprehensive drug-by-drug list of each patient63s prior regimens, but these drugs are explicitly mentioned in the text."
36415058,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,No. The paper reports an interview-based study and does not report HIV sequences from patient samples.,"After clinical chart review, individuals with HIV-RNA <50 copies/ml, a negative HBsAg, and no previous failure or documented resistance to integrase inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (i.e., eligible for cabotegravir and rilpivirine), coming to our clinic for a routine ambulatory visit during 2021, were consecutively interviewed by the referring physician: they were asked if they were favorable or not to consider the switch to LA cabotegravir and rilpivirine every 2 months. A total of 486 individuals eligible for LA cabotegravir and rilpivirine were interviewed.","The methods and results describe an interview of clinic attendees (eligibility review and interviews) and report counts of interviewed individuals; there is no mention anywhere in the text of obtaining, amplifying, sequencing, or analyzing HIV genetic material.

It must be underlined that the individuals enrolled in the CARISEL study had already experienced the LA regimen (or at least oral cabotegravir and rilpivirine), while people interviewed in our investigation did not.","The authors clearly distinguish their interview-based clinic population from participants in the CARISEL clinical trial, stating that the interviewed people did not enroll in CARISEL and were not trial participants."
36415058,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"No sequences are reported. The paper does state that many individuals had long histories of ART (median 12.5 years), but no sequencing was performed on those individuals.","Another peculiarity of our study is that there were many individuals with a long history of exposure to ART (median 12.5 years), while in most other studies that have evaluated LA in people receiving their first-line regimen. A total of 486 individuals eligible for LA cabotegravir and rilpivirine were interviewed.","Although participants had prior exposure to antiretroviral therapy, the manuscript contains no sequencing data from these individuals.

36571282,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No.,"For this study, participating sites were asked to provide a FASTA viral sequence, encoding the HIV integrase and RT obtained at the time of inclusion. As in previous studies, we found that evaluation of only SDRMs shows a very different picture from CRR. In this study, as in previous studies conducted in Spain and Europe, in addition to TDR, we analyzed CRR, which could impact clinicians' choice of the first-line regimen, rather than SDRMs.","The manuscript describes a surveillance/consortium study using routine resistance testing of newly diagnosed, ART-naive individuals rather than enrollment in a clinical trial; no trial design, randomization, or trial identifiers are mentioned."

HIV-1 pol sequences (46PR/45RT/67IN) were recovered from 67 (88.2%) of 76 children/adolescents (median age 12 years), five of them ART-naive and 62 treated at sampling; all treated children/adolescents with pol sequence showed virological failure (VL >50 copies/mL).","The Results explicitly state that among the sequenced subjects, 62 were treated at sampling and all treated children/adolescents with pol sequence showed virological failure (VL >50 copies/mL), which confirms sequences were obtained from individuals failing therapy."
36454248,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No. The patients were under routine clinical follow-up at a hospital and enrolled with informed consent; they were not participants in a clinical trial.,"Plasma samples from 76 HIV-positive naive or ART-treated children and adolescents with therapeutic failure under clinical follow-up at this hospital were collected during 2018--19.. This research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by local Ethics Committees for Clinical Investigation from Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal (Madrid, Spain) and from Hospital del Niño Doctor José Renán Esquivel (Panamá). Informed consent was required for all parents or legal tutors for inclusion in the cohort.","The manuscript describes recruitment from routine clinical follow-up and cohort inclusion with ethics approval and informed consent; there is no description of a clinical trial protocol, randomization, or trial registration, indicating this was observational/cohort sampling rather than a clinical trial."
36454248,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes. The study includes sequences from ART-experienced (treated) individuals; 71 were treated at sampling and sequences were recovered from 62 treated individuals.,"During 2018--19, plasma was collected from 76 HIV-infected children/adolescents (5 ART-naive, 71 treated) in Panama for HIV-1 DRM pol analysis.. HIV-1 pol sequences (46PR/45RT/67IN) were recovered from 67 (88.2%) of 76 children/adolescents (median age 12 years), five of them ART-naive and 62 treated at sampling.","The cohort included both ART-naive and ART-experienced individuals, and the Results specify that sequences were recovered from 62 treated participants, confirming the paper reports sequences from persons with prior ARV exposure."
36454248,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs).","Five were ART-naive and 62 ART-treated under virological failure (viraemia >50 copies/mL) with previous exposure to NRTIs, (100%), NNRTIs (45.2%), PIs (95.2%) and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs, 17.7%).. All 62 children/adolescents treated with pol sequence had received NRTIs, 45.2% non-NRTIs, 95.2% PIs and only 11 (17.7%) INSTIs.","The Abstract and Results provide percentages of prior exposure to the four main ARV classes (NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs, INSTIs) among treated participants, making clear which drug classes were used before sampling."
36454248,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Commonly reported drugs included lamivudine and zidovudine (most patients), lopinavir/ritonavir, efavirenz, and raltegravir for INSTI-experienced patients; other mentioned drugs include emtricitabine, tenofovir (used in older patients), darunavir, and various prophylaxis regimens of zidovudine alone or zidovudine+lamivudine.","Most treated children (98.6%) had received lamivudine + zidovudine, followed by lopinavir/ritonavir (95.8%) and efavirenz (45.1%).. The two naive children had received zidovudine and lamivudine as prophylaxis before sampling. Eleven out of 14 had available pol sequence and two-thirds of them (63.6%) presented DRMs to NRTIs and NNRTIs and major DRMs to PIs and INSTIs. The DRM prevalence to the main ARV families found in the 11 HIV-1-infected treated children/adolescents with INSTI experience (all with raltegravir) is shown in Table 2.","The Results and cohort description list specific drugs and combinations used by the cohort: lamivudine (3TC) and zidovudine (ZDV) were nearly universal, lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) was used in most, efavirenz (EFV) in many, and INSTI exposure was with raltegravir (RAL). The manuscript also references emtricitabine, tenofovir, darunavir and prophylactic zidovudine ± lamivudine, supporting this list of drugs."

It does not, however, specify which of these participants had genotypic sequencing performed, so we can only report the countries represented among participants overall."
35945163,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,The compassionate use data cover February 2016 through July 2020; the paper does not specify exact sample collection dates for sequencing separately.,"Efficacy and safety data were available for 35 people living with HIV-1 who received cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA through the compassionate use programme from February 2016 through July 2020. At data cutoff for this report in July 2020, data from pregnant women receiving cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA were limited to 13 study participants who had 15 pregnancies in phase II/III LA clinical trials...",The timeframe reported for the compassionate use programme is Feb 2016 to July 2020. The manuscript does not provide specific dates for when genotypic tests or sequences (if any) were obtained; therefore the cohort/sample timeframe is the programme period.
35945163,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not reported.,"Data for plasma viral load, CD4+ cell count, ART resistance profile, number of injections, and safety and tolerability, including injection site reactions (ISRs), were obtained from quarterly clinical updates as reported by the treating physician. Although previous ART history was examined as closely as possible, pre-existing mutations may have been present but unknown to the evaluating committees.","The methods and assessments describe collection of resistance profiles but provide no laboratory sequencing methodology (no mention of cloning, single-genome amplification, or population sequencing).

At time of discontinuation, each of the six participants with detectable viremia at programme entry had NNRTI resistance-associated mutations not observed at programme initiation that conferred resistance to rilpivirine; three people with detectable viremia at programme entry had mutations in integrase at time of discontinuation that were not observed at programme initiation.","The manuscript explicitly refers to reverse transcriptase (NNRTI-associated) and integrase mutations detected at initiation and at discontinuation, indicating that genotypic resistance information pertains to RT and IN regions. No other gene regions (e.g., protease) are discussed in terms of sequencing results."
35945163,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not reported.,"Data for plasma viral load, CD4+ cell count, ART resistance profile, number of injections, and safety and tolerability... were obtained from quarterly clinical updates as reported by the treating physician. This investigation was not a clinical trial per se, it lacks the strict criteria regarding data collection, including complete adherence data, and the AE/SAE reporting mandated in clinical trials.","The paper describes clinical data collection and reporting of resistance-associated mutations but provides no laboratory methods describing the sequencing technique (e.g., Sanger population sequencing, next-generation sequencing, or single-genome sequencing). Therefore the sequencing method is not specified."
35945163,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,"Not explicitly reported; the paper reports plasma viral load data and ART resistance profiles, so sequencing (if performed) was likely based on plasma-derived virus, but sample type is not specified.","Data for plasma viral load, CD4+ cell count, ART resistance profile, number of injections, and safety and tolerability... were obtained from quarterly clinical updates as reported by the treating physician.

In clinical practice resistance testing is commonly performed on plasma HIV-1 RNA; however, because the paper does not explicitly state sample type for sequencing/genotyping, it cannot be confirmed from the text."
35945163,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Yes — the paper reports resistance-associated mutations detected at discontinuation in individuals with incomplete virological response (virological failure).,"Seven (20%) people living with HIV-1, six of whom were women, stopped LA therapy because of incomplete virological response (>50 copies/mL), with HIV-1 RNA at discontinuation ranging from 55 to 186,972 copies/mL.

35945163,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No — participants were enrolled in a compassionate use programme and were explicitly ineligible for phase III clinical trials.,"Individuals who were eligible to participate in any phase III clinical trial of cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA were not eligible. Because this investigation was not a clinical trial per se, it lacks the strict criteria regarding data collection...",The methods clearly state that this was a compassionate use single-patient request programme and that individuals eligible for phase III trials were not eligible for this programme; the authors also state the investigation was not a clinical trial.
35945163,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes — many participants had prior ART exposure and resistance-associated mutations were reported; the paper includes participants with prior multiple ART regimens.,"Virological suppression was achieved with cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA in 16 (57%) of 28 people living with HIV-1 who entered the compassionate use programme, 13 of whom had taken three or more prior ART regimens.

35945163,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Reported drug classes include NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), INSTIs (integrase strand transfer inhibitors), NRTIs (nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors), and PIs (protease inhibitors; e.g., boosted darunavir).","At time of discontinuation, each of the six participants with detectable viremia at programme entry had NNRTI resistance-associated mutations not observed at programme initiation that conferred resistance to rilpivirine; three people with detectable viremia at programme entry had mutations in integrase at time of discontinuation that were not observed at programme initiation, two of whom had mutations in integrase that conferred resistance to cabotegravir. The other four people living with HIV started an oral regimen after stopping cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA... one of whom eventually achieved virological suppression after starting oral cobicistat-boosted darunavir/tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine.","The text explicitly references NNRTI- and integrase-associated mutations, and names a regimen containing a protease inhibitor (cobicistat-boosted darunavir) together with NRTIs (tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine) and an INSTI (dolutegravir elsewhere). These references indicate prior exposure to NNRTIs, INSTIs, NRTIs, and PIs among participants."
35945163,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"The manuscript explicitly names cobicistat-boosted darunavir, tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), emtricitabine (FTC), and dolutegravir as drugs used by some individuals; it also discusses resistance to rilpivirine and mentions integrase inhibitor resistance (e.g., cabotegravir resistance-associated mutations).","The other four people living with HIV started an oral regimen after stopping cabotegravir LA + rilpivirine LA, one of whom eventually achieved virological suppression after starting oral cobicistat-boosted darunavir/tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine, two were not virologically suppressed at time of analysis, and one did not have data available since time of discontinuation. At the time of discontinuation, each of the six participants with detectable viremia at programme entry had NNRTI resistance-associated mutations not observed at programme initiation that conferred resistance to rilpivirine; three people... had mutations in integrase at time of discontinuation that were not observed at programme initiation, two of whom had mutations in integrase that conferred resistance to cabotegravir.","While the report refers broadly to prior ART regimens and resistance to drug classes, the only specific drug names given in the text are cobicistat-boosted darunavir, tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, dolutegravir, and the study drugs cabotegravir and rilpivirine (and resistance to rilpivirine). The paper does not provide a comprehensive list of all prior drugs used by participants, so the answer includes the drugs explicitly named."
36597160,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,"Yes — the paper reports HIV genotypes (Sanger sequencing) performed on patient samples, including genotypes at baseline and at virologic failure.","If the genotypes were not available in the database for patients who failed (at baseline and at virological failure), we went back to the paper chart or contacted the virology laboratory to collect the information. During the study period, genotypes were performed using Sanger sequencing. Results of genotypic resistance at the time of virologic failure were available for six patients and not performed or not available for the seven remaining patients.","The Methods state that genotypes were performed using Sanger sequencing and that the investigators retrieved genotype results from charts or virology labs when missing. The Results report genotypic resistance data at virologic failure for a subset of patients, indicating sequences/genotypes were obtained from patient samples."
36597160,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No — the paper does not report in vitro phenotypic drug susceptibility testing data; it reports genotypic resistance (sequence-based) results only.,"During the study period, genotypes were performed using Sanger sequencing. Results of genotypic resistance at the time of virologic failure were available for six patients and not performed or not available for the seven remaining patients.","The paper describes genotypic resistance testing (Sanger sequencing) and reports resistance-associated mutations, but contains no mention of phenotypic or in vitro susceptibility assays (no IC50/phenotype data), so only genotypic sequence-based resistance data were reported."
36597160,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No — the paper does not indicate that sequences were deposited in a public database and states that study data will not be shared publicly.,"If the genotypes were not available in the database for patients who failed (at baseline and at virological failure), we went back to the paper chart or contacted the virology laboratory to collect the information. Data will not be shared publicly. Data could be made available to any researcher interested.","Although genotypes were obtained from clinical records and labs, the manuscript does not report any public deposition (e.g., GenBank accession numbers). The Data Availability section explicitly states data will not be shared publicly, implying sequences were not publicly deposited."
36597160,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,"During the study period, genotypes were performed using Sanger sequencing. Data will not be shared publicly. Data could be made available to any researcher interested.","The paper provides no GenBank or other accession numbers for sequences; the Data Availability statement indicates data are not publicly shared, supporting that no public accession numbers were provided."
36597160,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,152 individuals had an HIV resistance genotype available before the switch; genotypic resistance at virologic failure was available for 6 patients (of 13 failures).,"Among 152 patients with an HIV resistance genotype available before the switch, 31/152 (20.3%), and 17/152 (11.2%) had the M184V/I and M184V/I + at least one TDF-associated resistance mutation identified, respectively. Results of genotypic resistance at the time of virologic failure were available for six patients and not performed or not available for the seven remaining patients.","The Results explicitly state that 152 patients had a resistance genotype available before the switch. Separately, genotypes at time of virologic failure were available for 6 of the 13 failing patients. Combining these statements gives counts of patients with sequencing/genotype data at baseline and at failure."
36597160,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,France (multicenter cohort in the Paris area).,"COREVIH IDF Est is a group of 27 clinical centers located in the Paris area, with approximately 11,000 HIV-infected patients on follow-up in 2014. Eligible patients were adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with controlled HIV-1 infection on any stable ART regimen who switched to E/C/F/TDF between February 2014 and August 2015.","The study was conducted within COREVIH IDF Est clinical centers in the Paris area and refers to French ethics and regulatory approvals, indicating the patient samples originated from France."
36597160,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Patients switched (and samples collected) between February 2014 and August 2015; follow-up genotypes would have been obtained during the subsequent follow-up period (up to ~48 weeks thereafter).,"Eligible patients ... who switched to E/C/F/TDF between February 2014 (date of approval of E/C/F/TDF in France) and August 2015. During the 48 weeks of follow-up, any reason for ART change was collected, any plasma HIV-1 RNA measure between baseline and W48 ... During the study period, genotypes were performed using Sanger sequencing.","Enrollment (and baseline samples) occurred between Feb 2014 and Aug 2015, and genotypes at failure were performed during the study follow-up (within the 48-week observation window), so sequencing dates fall in that timeframe."
36597160,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No indication of cloning; genotyping was performed by Sanger sequencing without mention of cloning.,"If the genotypes were not available in the database for patients who failed (at baseline and at virological failure), we went back to the paper chart or contacted the virology laboratory to collect the information. During the study period, genotypes were performed using Sanger sequencing.",The Methods describe Sanger sequencing for genotypes but do not mention molecular cloning of PCR products prior to sequencing. Therefore there is no evidence that cloning was performed.
36597160,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,Pol region genes relevant to NRTI and INSTI resistance were sequenced — specifically reverse transcriptase (where NRTI mutations like M184V occur) and integrase (where INSTI mutations like N155H and Q148H occur).,"Among the six patients with available genotype, five had NRTI and INSTI RAMs. In our patients ... 5/6 (83.3%) patients showing at the time of failure the N155H (n = 4) or Q148H (n = 1) mutations. Among the patients who failed, M184V and other NRTI RAM conferring resistance to TDF were more frequent.","The reported resistance-associated mutations are in reverse transcriptase (NRTI mutations such as M184V) and in integrase (INSTI mutations N155H, Q148H), indicating sequencing targeted the pol gene regions encoding RT and integrase."
36597160,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Sanger sequencing (genotypic testing by Sanger).,"During the study period, genotypes were performed using Sanger sequencing. In France, it is usually recommended to perform genotyping in case of confirmed virologic failure with HIV RNA ≥ 200 copies/mL.","The Methods explicitly state that genotypes were performed using Sanger sequencing, which is the sequencing method used for the reported genotypic resistance tests."
36597160,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma samples (plasma HIV-1 RNA for genotyping in case of virologic failure).,"Controlled HIV-1 infection was defined by plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL without ART modification in the previous 12 months. In France, it is usually recommended to perform genotyping in case of confirmed virologic failure with HIV RNA ≥ 200 copies/mL.",Genotyping is described in the context of plasma HIV-1 RNA measurements and recommended when plasma viral load is ≥200 copies/mL; this indicates sequencing was performed on plasma-derived viral RNA.
36597160,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Yes — genotypic resistance results at the time of virologic failure were available for 6 of the 13 patients who experienced virologic failure.,Thirteen (3.5%) patients experienced virologic failure. Results of genotypic resistance at the time of virologic failure were available for six patients and not performed or not available for the seven remaining patients.,"The Results explicitly state that among the 13 patients with virologic failure, genotypes at failure were available for six, showing that sequences/genotypes were obtained from patients failing therapy."
36597160,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — this was a retrospective multicenter observational (non-interventional) cohort study, not a clinical trial.","We conducted a retrospective multicenter observational cohort study including adult patients with controlled HIV-1 infection on any stable ART regimen, who switched to E/C/F/TDF. Before enrollment in the Nadis® database, it is required that patients sign an informed consent form which was approved by the Paris Saint-Louis ethics committee and Commission Nationale Informatique et Libertés (CNIL) allowing the use of patients' data for non-interventional studies without the need for further consent in accordance with French regulations.",The Methods explicitly describe the study as retrospective and observational/non-interventional and reference consent consistent with use of EHR data rather than enrollment in an interventional clinical trial.
36597160,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"Yes — the study enrolled treatment-experienced patients and reports genotypes from individuals with prior ARV exposure (many had prior NRTI, PI/r, NNRTI, or INSTI regimens).","We conducted a retrospective multicenter observational cohort study within the COREVIH IDF Est clinical centers enrolling ART-experienced patients. Before switching to E/C/F/TDF, a majority of patients received a combination of two NRTI and a third agent: ritonavir-boosted PI (PI/r) in 195/382 (51.0%), NNRTI in 84/382 (22.0%) and INSTI in 67/382 (17.5%) patients.","The population is explicitly described as ART-experienced with most patients having prior ARV regimens; genotypes reported include resistance associated mutations that were present before the switch, confirming sequences came from previously treated individuals."
36597160,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"NRTIs (two-NRTI backbone), boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs).","Before switching to E/C/F/TDF, a majority of patients received a combination of two NRTI and a third agent: ritonavir-boosted PI (PI/r) in 195/382 (51.0%), NNRTI in 84/382 (22.0%) and INSTI in 67/382 (17.5%) patients. Among 152 patients with an HIV resistance genotype available before the switch, 31/152 (20.3%), and 17/152 (11.2%) had the M184V/I and M184V/I + at least one TDF-associated resistance mutation identified, respectively.","The manuscript lists the prior regimen composition and quantifies how many patients received PI/r, NNRTI or INSTI third agents on a two-NRTI backbone, indicating these drug classes were used before sequencing/genotyping."
36597160,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Specific drugs are not comprehensively listed for all patients; the paper indicates most patients received a two-NRTI backbone (including agents such as emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in many cases as implied by resistance patterns) plus a third agent that was a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor, an NNRTI, or an INSTI (prior INSTI exposure is noted). The manuscript also discusses elvitegravir (the study drug), and mentions other INSTIs (raltegravir, dolutegravir, bictegravir) in the Discussion as comparators.","Before switching to E/C/F/TDF, a majority of patients received a combination of two NRTI and a third agent: ritonavir-boosted PI (PI/r) in 195/382 (51.0%), NNRTI in 84/382 (22.0%) and INSTI in 67/382 (17.5%) patients. Among 152 patients with an HIV resistance genotype available before the switch, 31/152 (20.3%) ... had the M184V/I ... identified. In our retrospective cohort study of PWH fully suppressed on ART, the proportion of patients maintaining a plasma HIV RNA level < 50 copies/mL one year after switching to E/C/F/TDF was 82.0%.","The paper provides regimen class-level detail (two NRTIs plus PI/r, NNRTI, or INSTI). While it refers to NRTI drugs (FTC/TDF) by resistance mutations (M184V, TDF-associated mutations) and discusses specific INSTIs in context, it does not provide a comprehensive list of exact drug names taken by each participant beyond class descriptions and the study regimen (E/C/F/TDF)."
36659824,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes — the study performed baseline HIV-1 resistance genotyping on participant samples.,"At the baseline visit, samples were collected for routine testing, confirmation of HIV serology and HIV resistance genotyping. Baseline laboratory results and baseline genotype for HIV-1 drug resistance mutations were available at Week (W) 1 and by W4, respectively.","The Methods state that samples were collected specifically for HIV resistance genotyping and that baseline genotypes for HIV-1 drug resistance mutations were obtained and available by W4, indicating that patient-derived HIV sequences (genotypes) were generated from participant samples."
36659824,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No — the paper does not report newly generated in vitro drug susceptibility (phenotypic) assay results; it only references published in vitro IC95 values used to interpret plasma concentrations.,"Interpretation of BIC C24h results was based on the corresponding in vitro protein-adjusted IC95 for WT HIV-1: 162 ng/mL. Plasma concentrations of BIC, FTC and TFV were determined by a validated LC coupled with tandem MS (UPLC-MS/MS; Waters Acquity UPLC-TQD, Milford, MA, USA).","The manuscript uses an existing literature-derived in vitro protein-adjusted IC95 to interpret drug concentrations but does not describe performing phenotypic susceptibility assays on isolates. Thus, there are no reported in vitro susceptibility assay results generated in this study."
36659824,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No — the paper does not report depositing sequences in public repositories or provide accession numbers.,"At the baseline visit, samples were collected for routine testing, confirmation of HIV serology and HIV resistance genotyping. No emergent resistance-associated mutation was detected in those who did not achieve pVL <50 copies/mL at W24.","Although the paper describes performing baseline genotyping, it does not mention submission of sequence data to GenBank or other public repositories, nor does it provide any accession numbers. Therefore there is no indication that sequences were made publicly available."
36659824,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,"Baseline laboratory results and baseline genotype for HIV-1 drug resistance mutations were available at Week (W) 1 and by W4, respectively. The manuscript contains no GenBank accession numbers or statements of sequence deposition.",The text documents that genotyping was performed but provides no GenBank accession numbers or deposition details; hence no accession numbers are available from this paper.
36659824,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Not specified in the paper (number of genotyped samples is not reported explicitly).,"At the baseline visit, samples were collected for routine testing, confirmation of HIV serology and HIV resistance genotyping. One hundred and eighteen participants were enrolled across 15 sites in France between November 2019 and September 2020.","While the study enrolled 118 participants (112 included in the ITT analysis) and indicates that baseline genotyping was performed, the manuscript does not state how many individual participants actually had successful genotypic sequences generated. Therefore the exact number of sequenced individuals is not provided."
36659824,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,France.,"One hundred and eighteen participants were enrolled across 15 sites in France between November 2019 and September 2020. A limitation of the FAST study is that it only evaluated BIC/FTC/TAF in a same-day initiation approach in France, and results may not be generalizable to other geographical regions.","The study was conducted at 15 sites in France and samples were collected from study participants enrolled in France, so sequenced samples originated from France."
36659824,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Between November 2019 and September 2020.,"One hundred and eighteen participants were enrolled across 15 sites in France between November 2019 and September 2020. At the baseline visit, samples were collected for routine testing, confirmation of HIV serology and HIV resistance genotyping.","Enrollment (and baseline sample collection) occurred between November 2019 and September 2020, so sequencing would have been performed on samples obtained during that period."
36659824,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not reported / no indication that samples were cloned prior to sequencing.,"At the baseline visit, samples were collected for routine testing, confirmation of HIV serology and HIV resistance genotyping. The Methods describe collection of samples and genotyping availability by W4 but do not describe cloning steps.","The manuscript provides no methodological detail about cloning of samples prior to sequencing (no mention of cloning, single-genome amplification, or plasmid cloning), so cloning was not reported."
36659824,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,Pol region genes are implied — at least reverse transcriptase and integrase (mutations M184V and E157Q are discussed); protease sequencing is not explicitly described.,"Three participants discontinued the study treatment before W48 but remained on the study (one for pre-existing M184V resistance mutation, two for E157Q polymorphism in the integrase gene conferring possible resistance to BIC according to the 2019 French HIV-resistance algorithm). At the baseline visit, samples were collected for ... HIV resistance genotyping.","The manuscript refers to specific mutations: M184V (a reverse-transcriptase mutation) and E157Q (an integrase mutation), indicating that genotyping covered at least the reverse transcriptase and integrase regions of pol. Protease is not specifically mentioned, so only RT and integrase can be confirmed from the text."
36659824,10,What method was used for sequencing?,"Not reported — the paper does not specify the sequencing technology or genotyping method (e.g., Sanger or NGS).","At the baseline visit, samples were collected for routine testing, confirmation of HIV serology and HIV resistance genotyping. Baseline laboratory results and baseline genotype for HIV-1 drug resistance mutations were available at Week (W) 1 and by W4, respectively.","Although genotyping was performed and results were available by W4, the Methods do not describe the technical approach used for sequencing or genotyping (no mention of Sanger sequencing, next-generation sequencing, or commercial assay), so the sequencing method is not provided."
36659824,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Blood-derived samples (plasma) collected at baseline for routine testing and HIV resistance genotyping.,"At the baseline visit, samples were collected for routine testing, confirmation of HIV serology and HIV resistance genotyping. Plasma HIV-1-RNA was quantified using the COBAS 6800® HIV-1 Test kit (Roche, Bale, Switzerland) with a lower limit of quantification (LOQ) of 20 copies/mL.","The study describes collection of baseline samples and quantification of plasma HIV-1 RNA, implying that plasma (blood) specimens were used for virological measurements and genotypic resistance testing; no other specimen types are described."
36659824,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"Yes — resistance genotypic testing was recommended and performed in cases of virological non-response/failure, and the study reports no emergent resistance-associated mutations in those individuals.","In such cases, National French Guidelines also recommended performance of a resistance genotypic test and determination of BIC, FTC and tenofovir (TFV) plasma concentrations. No emergent resistance-associated mutation was detected in those who did not achieve pVL <50 copies/mL at W24 and W48.","The protocol specified genotypic testing for participants with virological non-response/failure and the Results report that no emergent resistance-associated mutations were detected among those who failed to suppress, indicating that genotypic sequences were obtained and analyzed for individuals with virological failure."
36659824,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"Yes — the study was a registered, prospective, multicentre, open-label single-arm clinical study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03858478).","The FAST study was a national, multicentre, prospective, open-label single-arm study assessing the feasibility, efficacy and safety of BIC/FTC/TAF in a same-day initiation model.

36659824,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No — previously treated individuals were excluded from the main ITT analyses and sequences from pretreated individuals are not reported in the results.,"Of 131 participants screened, 13 refused to participate ... Six had protocol violation: three false-positive HIV tests [one self-test and two HIV immunoassay (ELISA 4th generation) tests], one already in medical care, two pretreated). Thus, 112 were included in the ITT-FDA Snapshot analysis. At the baseline visit, samples were collected for ... HIV resistance genotyping.",The study excluded participants who were pretreated from the ITT population and the manuscript does not present genotyping results specifically from previously treated individuals; therefore sequences from pretreated individuals are not reported in the paper's primary results.
36659824,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not reported — the manuscript does not specify which antiretroviral drug classes (if any) prior-treated participants had received.,"Six had protocol violation: ... two pretreated). Thus, 112 were included in the ITT-FDA Snapshot analysis. The Methods and Results describe baseline genotyping and treatment with BIC/FTC/TAF but do not detail prior ARV regimens for the pretreated individuals.","Although a small number of screened participants were noted as 'pretreated', the paper does not provide details on the prior antiretroviral classes or regimens those individuals had received, so this information is not available from the manuscript."

The manuscript reports the study treatment (BIC/FTC/TAF) and baseline genotyping but does not list prior ARV drugs for the screened pretreated participants.",The paper mentions a small number of pretreated participants among those screened but does not give details on the specific drugs they had taken before enrollment; therefore the identities of prior drugs are not reported.
36660819,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,"Eight and 10 participants with CVF had treatment-emergent, resistance-associated mutations to RPV and integrase inhibitors, respectively. The RPV RAM E138K and the integrase inhibitor mutation S230S/R were detected at week 56.","The Results describe detection of resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) in participants with confirmed or suspected virologic failure and specify particular mutations (eg, E138K in RPV and S230S/R in integrase) detected in patient samples. Reporting of these specific viral mutations indicates that sequence/genotypic analyses were performed on patient-derived samples."
36660819,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No — the paper does not present in vitro phenotypic susceptibility data.,"Endpoints included the proportion of participants ... treatment-emergent genotypic and phenotypic resistance, incidence and severity of adverse events. Results describe treatment-emergent genotypic resistance (RAMs) to RPV and INSTIs but do not present phenotypic (in vitro susceptibility) data.","Although phenotypic resistance was listed as an endpoint in Methods, the Results and Discussion only report genotypic resistance (specific RAMs) and plasma drug concentrations; no phenotypic or in vitro susceptibility assay results are shown or tabulated in the presented text. Therefore no in vitro drug susceptibility data are reported in this paper."
36660819,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No — sequences or accession numbers are not reported as publicly available.,Data sharing requests will be considered by the management group upon written request to the corresponding author. No GenBank accession numbers or other public sequence identifiers are provided in the manuscript.,The paper states a data-sharing policy by request but does not include GenBank accession numbers or indicate deposition of sequences in public databases. Hence sequences are not documented as publicly available in the publication.
36660819,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,Not reported.,No GenBank accession numbers or other public sequence identifiers are provided in the manuscript. Data sharing requests will be considered by the management group upon written request to the corresponding author.,"A search of the manuscript text reveals no listed accession numbers; the only data-sharing statement indicates data may be available on request, so GenBank accession numbers were not included in the paper."
36660819,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Not specified in the manuscript.,"Of the 14 participants with CVF, 6 (43%) had 2 or more of the baseline factors associated with increased risk of CVF. The manuscript describes detection of RAMs in participants with CVF and SVF samples but does not state the total number of individuals who had sequencing performed.","While the text reports sequencing/genotypic results for participants with confirmed or suspected virologic failure (eg, 14 CVF cases and specific RAM detections), it does not provide a total count of individuals who underwent sequencing. Therefore the exact number sequenced is not reported."
36660819,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not reported.,"ATLAS-2M is a phase 3b, randomized, multicenter study but the manuscript does not list participating countries in the provided text. No country-level attribution of sequenced samples is given.","Although the study is described as multicenter, the paper excerpt does not enumerate countries or link sequence results to specific countries, so the origin countries for sequenced samples are not specified."

No explicit collection years are provided for sequencing.","Timing is described in study weeks rather than calendar years; the text does not state the calendar years in which sequencing samples were collected, so years cannot be determined from the manuscript."
36660819,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not reported / no indication that cloning was performed.,"Results describe detection of treatment-emergent RAMs in SVF and baseline PBMC samples but the manuscript does not describe cloning of samples prior to sequencing. Methods and sequencing procedures (eg, cloning) are not detailed in the provided text.","The paper reports genotypic findings but does not include methodological detail about whether viral samples were cloned before sequencing (for example, single-genome amplification or clone sequencing). In absence of such description, cloning is not documented."
36660819,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,Integrase and reverse transcriptase (pol region) were sequenced/reported.,"Eight and 10 participants with CVF had treatment-emergent, resistance-associated mutations to RPV and integrase inhibitors, respectively. Specific mutations reported include RPV RAMs (eg, E138A, Y181Y/C, E138K, K101E, M230L) and integrase mutations (eg, Q148R, N155H, Q148Q/R + N155N/H).","RPV (rilpivirine) resistance-associated mutations map to the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene and the named INSTI RAMs (Q148, N155, etc.) map to the integrase gene. Reporting of these mutations indicates sequencing of RT and integrase regions within the pol gene."
36660819,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not reported.,"The manuscript lists endpoints including treatment-emergent genotypic and phenotypic resistance but does not describe sequencing methodology (eg, Sanger sequencing or next-generation sequencing) in the provided Methods.

36660819,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma viral samples (SVF/plasma) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were used for sequencing.,The additional participant who had non--protocol-defined virologic failure at week 48 (Q8W) had no RAMs to RPV or INSTIs present from baseline peripheral blood mononuclear cells; the RPV RAM E138K and the integrase inhibitor mutation S230S/R were detected at week 56. Treatment-emergent RAMs were reported in SVF samples.,"The text explicitly mentions baseline PBMCs and detection of RAMs in SVF (suspected virologic failure) samples, implying sequencing was performed on both proviral DNA from PBMCs and plasma-derived viral RNA from participants at failure timepoints."
36660819,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Yes.,"Of the 14 participants with CVF, several developed treatment-emergent RPV and INSTI RAMs, and both participants with CVF since week 96 had treatment-emergent RAMs in SVF samples. The additional participant with non--protocol-defined virologic failure had RPV RAM E138K and integrase mutation S230S/R detected at week 56.","The manuscript reports genotypic resistance findings specifically in participants who experienced confirmed or suspected virologic failure while receiving CAB+RPV LA, indicating sequences were obtained and analyzed from those failing on the regimen."
36660819,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,Yes.,"ATLAS-2M is a phase 3b, randomized, open-label, multicenter, parallel-group noninferiority study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of CAB+RPV LA administered Q8W versus Q4W in virologically suppressed PWH. The title indicates 152-week results from ATLAS-2M, a randomized, open-label, Phase 3b, noninferiority study.","The manuscript repeatedly identifies ATLAS-2M as a randomized phase 3b clinical trial, so all participants were enrolled in that clinical trial."
36660819,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes.,"Overall, 1045 participants were included in the ITT-E population (Q8W, n = 522; Q4W, n = 523); 391 (37%) participants had prior CAB+RPV exposure. The manuscript also refers to baseline pro-viral RPV RAMs being a baseline factor associated with increased risk of CVF.","Participants were virologically suppressed at enrollment and many had prior exposure to cabotegravir and rilpivirine; baseline proviral resistance mutations are discussed, indicating sequencing/genotypic assessment included individuals with prior ARV exposure."
36660819,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are explicitly indicated; participants had prior exposure to CAB (an INSTI) and RPV (an NNRTI).,"Overall, 1045 participants ... 391 (37%) participants had prior CAB+RPV exposure. The manuscript reports treatment-emergent mutations to RPV and integrase inhibitors (INSTIs).","Cabotegravir is an integrase inhibitor and rilpivirine is an NNRTI; the paper specifically notes prior CAB+RPV exposure and reports RAMs to RPV and INSTIs, so INSTI and NNRTI classes were received prior to or during sequencing. The paper does not comprehensively list other ARV classes for individuals prior to sequencing."
36660819,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Cabotegravir and rilpivirine were received prior to and during the study; specific other individual prior drugs are not detailed in the manuscript.,"Participants were randomized to receive CAB+RPV LA Q8W or Q4W and 391 (37%) participants had prior CAB+RPV exposure. The manuscript also notes re-suppression on subsequent oral ART regimens (protease inhibitor-based regimen or dolutegravir-based regimen) after CVF, but baseline prior individual drugs are not enumerated.","The trial intervention itself was cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV), and a substantial proportion had prior exposure to CAB+RPV. While the paper mentions subsequent use of protease inhibitor-based or dolutegravir-based regimens after failure, it does not provide a full list of prior ARV drugs for each participant; therefore CAB and RPV are the explicitly reported drugs received before/during sequencing."
36779485,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,Genotypic sequence data from 277 patients initiating ART and 1372 patients experiencing NNRTI-treatment failure were included for analysis as previously described [7]. Pol sequences were submitted to Stanford HIVdb v9.0 to identify rilpivirine DRMs.,"The manuscript explicitly states that genotypic sequence data from patient cohorts (277 ART initiators and 1372 patients failing NNRTI-based ART) were used and that pol sequences were submitted to Stanford HIVdb for DRM identification, indicating HIV sequences were obtained from patient samples."
36779485,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No.,"Pol sequences were submitted to Stanford HIVdb v9.0 to identify rilpivirine DRMs. Resistance profiles were categorized as susceptible (including potential low-level resistance), intermediate (including low-level resistance), or high-level resistance.",The paper describes genotypic analysis and genotype-based resistance predictions using Stanford HIVdb but does not describe any phenotypic or in vitro drug susceptibility assays; resistance is inferred from genotype rather than measured in vitro.

Baseline genotypic resistance testing was performed retrospectively for all participants and was not available to inform treatment decisions.","Enrollment dates define when participants (and thus baseline samples) were obtained: August 2019 to July 2020, so sequencing samples derive from that period."
36706364,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not reported / No evidence of cloning prior to sequencing.,"Baseline genotypic resistance testing was performed retrospectively for all participants and was not available to inform treatment decisions. Genotypic resistance was classified using the Stanford algorithm (version 8.9-1), with a score 615 indicating at least low-level resistance.",The Methods describe genotypic resistance testing and interpretation but do not mention cloning of samples prior to sequencing; therefore cloning was not reported.
36706364,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,Reverse transcriptase (RT) was assessed (mutations K65R and M184V/I reported); integrase was also assessed for resistance (no integrase resistance mutations detected).,"Of these, 35.7% (20/56) had K65R mutations and 82.1% (46/56) had M184V/I mutations. Three participants were eligible for resistance testing and all three had resistance testing conducted (including the two participants with virological failure), but none were found to have integrase resistance mutations.","The reported RT mutations (K65R, M184V/I) indicate sequencing/analysis of the reverse transcriptase region; the explicit statement that no integrase resistance mutations were found indicates the integrase region was also assessed."
36706364,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not specified in the paper.,"Baseline genotypic resistance testing was performed retrospectively for all participants and was not available to inform treatment decisions. Genotypic resistance was classified using the Stanford algorithm (version 8.9-1), with a score 615 indicating at least low-level resistance.","While the paper describes genotypic resistance testing and interpretation, it does not detail the laboratory sequencing methodology (e.g., Sanger vs. next-generation sequencing), so the sequencing method is not reported."
36706364,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Not explicitly stated in the paper (sample type not reported).,"VL was assessed at baseline and every subsequent visit, with a repeat VL after two weeks of enhanced adherence counselling if VL was 50 copies/mL after week 12. Baseline genotypic resistance testing was performed retrospectively for all participants and was not available to inform treatment decisions.","The manuscript describes viral load monitoring and genotypic resistance testing but does not explicitly state the biological specimen used for sequencing (for example, plasma RNA). Therefore the sample type is not reported."
36706364,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"Yes — three participants underwent resistance testing during follow-up, including the two participants who met criteria for virological failure.","Two participants met criteria for virologic failure (two consecutive VL 1000 copies/mL after week 12) during the follow up period: one at 36 weeks and one at 52 weeks. Three participants were eligible for resistance testing and all three had resistance testing conducted (including the two participants with virological failure), but none were found to have integrase resistance mutations.","The Results explicitly state that the two participants meeting virologic failure criteria were among the three who had resistance testing conducted, indicating sequences (genotypic data) were obtained from individuals with virological failure."
36706364,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"Yes — participants were enrolled in a single-arm, prospective, interventional study registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03991013).","ARTIST is a single arm, prospective, interventional study conducted in Khayelitsha, South Africa. The protocol was approved by the University of Cape Town's Human Research Ethics Committee (039/2019) and is available with the statistical analysis plan on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03991013).","The Methods describe ARTIST as a prospective interventional study with a registered protocol on ClinicalTrials.gov, indicating this was a clinical trial (single-arm)."
36706364,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"Yes — participants had failed first-line ART consisting of tenofovir, lamivudine/emtricitabine and an NNRTI prior to switching to TLD, and genotypic resistance reflective of prior ARV exposure was reported.","Adults who had virologic failure (defined as two consecutive VL 1000 copies/mL, 2-24 months apart) on a first-line regimen consisting of tenofovir, XTC and efavirenz or nevirapine were invited to participate. Low, intermediate or high-level resistance to tenofovir, XTC or both was found in 89.3% (50/56 participants with results).","Eligibility required prior first-line exposure to tenofovir, lamivudine/emtricitabine and an NNRTI, and the high prevalence of NRTI resistance demonstrates that sequences came from individuals with prior ARV exposure."
36706364,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).,"Adults who had virologic failure ... on a first-line regimen consisting of tenofovir, XTC and efavirenz or nevirapine were invited to participate. We conducted a single arm, prospective, interventional study in two primary care clinics in Khayelitsha, South Africa.","The first-line regimen described included tenofovir and lamivudine/emtricitabine (NRTIs) and efavirenz or nevirapine (NNRTIs), so participants had prior exposure to NRTI and NNRTI drug classes before sequencing."
36706364,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Tenofovir and lamivudine or emtricitabine (XTC), and an NNRTI: efavirenz or nevirapine.","Adults who had virologic failure ... on a first-line regimen consisting of tenofovir, XTC and efavirenz or nevirapine were invited to participate. Low, intermediate or high-level resistance to tenofovir, XTC or both was found in 89.3% (50/56 participants with results).","The Methods explicitly list the first-line drugs participants had been taking (tenofovir, lamivudine/emtricitabine, and efavirenz or nevirapine), and the resistance results reference tenofovir and XTC, confirming these were the prior drugs."
36738248,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,"Yes. The paper reports HIV sequences obtained from patient plasma samples, including both Sanger (SS) and next-generation (NGS, Illumina) sequences from participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and Zurich Primary HIV Cohort.","To compare the HIV-DRMs detected by SS and NGS, we included participants enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) with SS and NGS sequences available with sample collection dates ≤7 days apart. Overall, 24,394 SS sequences and 5211 NGS (Illumina) sequences were available from 21,297 PLHIV enrolled in the SHCS as of August 2021.","The Methods and Results state explicitly that the study used SS and NGS sequences from cohort participants and gives counts of SS and NGS sequences available from people living with HIV (PLHIV), demonstrating that sequences derived from patient samples were analyzed."
36738248,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No. The paper reports genotypic resistance interpretation (in silico) using the Stanford database but does not report in vitro phenotypic (laboratory) drug susceptibility assays.,Both SS and NGS sequences were analysed using the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database genotypic resistance interpretation program (Algorithm version 9.0). For NGS sequences we reconstructed the pol region of HIV genome for NGS sequences at different variant-calling thresholds.,"The manuscript describes genotypic interpretation of sequences with the Stanford algorithm and prediction of resistance levels, but it contains no mention of laboratory-based phenotypic susceptibility testing (e.g., phenotypic assays), so only in silico genotypic resistance data are reported."
36738248,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,Not reported as publicly deposited in GenBank; sequences are stored in internal cohort databases (SwissHIVGenomeDB and SHCS Drug Resistance Database).,"The SHCS Drug Resistance Database contains the HIV sequence data, primarily partial pol genes, sequenced from these plasma samples using SS. The sequences of the resulting 'reads' (nucleic acid fragments) were stored in the SwissHIVGenomeDB.","The paper specifies storage of sequence data in cohort-maintained databases (SwissHIVGenomeDB and SHCS Drug Resistance Database) but does not state that sequences were deposited in public repositories (e.g., GenBank) or list public accession numbers; therefore public deposition is not reported in the text provided."
36738248,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,Not reported in the manuscript text provided; no GenBank accession numbers are listed.,"The sequences of the resulting 'reads' (nucleic acid fragments) were stored in the SwissHIVGenomeDB. Overall, 24,394 SS sequences and 5211 NGS (Illumina) sequences were available from 21,297 PLHIV enrolled in the SHCS as of August 2021.","Although the paper describes where sequences are stored internally, there are no GenBank accession numbers or statements of GenBank deposition in the provided content, so specific accession numbers are not available from the text."
36738248,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,"The primary analysis included 527 people living with HIV (PLHIV), corresponding to 594 SS/NGS sample pairs.","After excluding sequences based on these quality control steps, we obtained 594 sample pairs from 527 PLHIV. Of these PLHIV, 342 were also enrolled in the ZPHI.","The Results section reports the final number of sample pairs and explicitly states the number of distinct PLHIV included (527), which is the number of individuals whose samples were used in the study analyses."
36738248,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Switzerland (participants were enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and the Zurich Primary HIV Cohort).,Our study population consisted of people living with HIV (PLHIV) enrolled in the SHCS and the Zurich Primary HIV Cohort Study (ZPHI). The SHCS is a prospective multicentre study that is highly representative of the HIV-1 epidemic in Switzerland.,"The cohorts named (SHCS and ZPHI) are Swiss cohorts, and the text explicitly states the SHCS represents the HIV epidemic in Switzerland, indicating samples originate from Switzerland."
36738248,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Specific sample collection years are not provided in the manuscript text supplied; counts and cohort descriptions are given as of August 2021 but exact collection years for the analyzed samples are not reported.,"Overall, 24,394 SS sequences and 5211 NGS (Illumina) sequences were available from 21,297 PLHIV enrolled in the SHCS as of August 2021. The ZPHI is an observational, prospective, monocentre study at the University Hospital Zurich started in 2002.","While the manuscript gives cohort timelines (e.g., ZPHI start date and data availability as of August 2021), it does not state the calendar years when the specific samples used in the 594 sample pairs were collected, so precise sample years cannot be determined from the provided text."
36738248,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No. The methods describe direct RT-PCR amplification of viral RNA into overlapping amplicons for sequencing (Sanger and Illumina) and do not describe cloning of samples prior to sequencing.,"data were generated by manually extracting viral RNA from blood samples then reverse transcribing and amplifying the nucleic acids using primers to define four overlapping amplicons spanning the whole genome, which were fragmented and sequenced with Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq platforms. SS was performed by amplification and sequencing of HIV genomic regions targeted by antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, such as the protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN) regions.",The sequencing workflows describe direct amplification and sequencing (amplicon-based NGS and population Sanger sequencing) and make no mention of molecular cloning steps; thus samples were not cloned prior to sequencing according to the methods described.
36738248,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"The pol region was the focus, including protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN); NGS often provided (near) whole-genome sequences while SS primarily covered partial pol (PR, RT, IN) regions.","The SHCS Drug Resistance Database contains the HIV sequence data, primarily partial pol genes, sequenced from these plasma samples using SS. SS was performed by amplification and sequencing of HIV genomic regions targeted by antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, such as the protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN) regions.","Multiple sections state that analyses focused on the pol region and explicitly list PR, RT and IN as the sequenced regions; NGS data are described as predominantly (near) whole genome but the comparison was restricted to pol."
36738248,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Sanger sequencing (population SS) and next-generation sequencing (Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq). NGS reads were assembled with de novo assembly (velvet) and iteratively aligned using the SmaltAlign pipeline.,"SS was performed by amplification and sequencing of HIV genomic regions ... This method of population sequencing generates a single consensus sequence per sample. NGS sequences were generated using previously described protocols ... which were fragmented and sequenced with Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq platforms. Briefly, Illumina sample reads are read with seqtk, de novo assembly of sampled reads is performed with velvet, and iterative alignment of NGS reads and contigs is performed with Smalt.","The Methods explicitly describe use of Sanger population sequencing for SS and Illumina-based platforms for NGS, and they list the bioinformatic tools used for read processing and assembly (seqtk, velvet, SmaltAlign)."
36738248,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma/blood samples: viral RNA was manually extracted from blood/plasma samples collected from cohort participants.,"Plasma samples from PLHIV in the SHCS are collected twice per year. Briefly, the data were generated by manually extracting viral RNA from blood samples then reverse transcribing and amplifying the nucleic acids using primers to define four overlapping amplicons spanning the whole genome...","The manuscript states sequencing was performed on plasma samples and that viral RNA was extracted from blood samples, indicating plasma/blood-derived viral RNA was sequenced."
36738248,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"Not explicitly reported. The paper reports ART status at sampling (20.4% on ART, 76.3% ART-naive) and analyzes resistance, but it does not explicitly state which sequences came from individuals with documented virological failure.","At sample collection, 20.4% of PLHIV were on ART and 76.3% were ART naive. We assessed if PLHIV with HIV-DRMs had had prior ART therapy with or without ARV drugs that select for the detected HIV-DRMs.","While the study distinguishes ART-experienced versus ART-naive participants and examines prior ARV exposure, the provided text does not define or report virological failure status for individual participants, so the presence of sequences specifically from virological failure cases is not documented in the excerpt."
36738248,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No. Participants were enrolled in observational cohort studies (the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and the Zurich Primary HIV Cohort), not a clinical trial.","Our study population consisted of people living with HIV (PLHIV) enrolled in the SHCS and the Zurich Primary HIV Cohort Study (ZPHI). The ZPHI is an observational, prospective, monocentre study at the University Hospital Zurich started in 2002.",The cohorts are described as prospective observational studies; there is no mention that participants were enrolled in an interventional clinical trial.
36738248,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes. The study includes ART-experienced individuals and assesses prior ARV exposure in relation to detected drug-resistance mutations.,"At sample collection, 20.4% of PLHIV were on ART and 76.3% were ART naive. We assessed if PLHIV with HIV-DRMs had had prior ART therapy with or without ARV drugs that select for the detected HIV-DRMs.","The manuscript explicitly reports that a proportion of participants were on ART at sampling and describes analyses stratified by prior ARV exposure, indicating sequences from previously ARV-treated individuals were included."
36738248,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) were considered; integrase inhibitors (INSTIs) are mentioned but SS coverage of integrase was limited.","For each of the 594 sample pairs, we assessed the occurrence of 53 DRMs in the PI and RT region that confer at least low-level resistance to a PI, NRTI or NNRTI drug by themselves. INSTI-DRM were excluded because only 3.2% of SS sequences covered the integrase region.","Analyses focused on DRMs conferring resistance to PI, NRTI and NNRTI drug classes and explicitly note limited integrase (INSTI) coverage, indicating those were the primary drug classes relevant to prior therapy in the study."
36738248,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Specific antiretroviral drug names are not listed in the provided manuscript text; the paper reports drug-class level analyses and refers to supplemental tables (e.g., Table S3) for drug-level resistance interpretations but does not enumerate individual drug names in the main text.","Resistance was compared either at the level of individual DRMs or at the level of the resistance score for the entire genotype. For the latter case, we considered drug resistance level interpretations for the ARV drugs (Table S3). We assessed the occurrence of 53 DRMs in the PI and RT region that confer at least low-level resistance to a PI, NRTI or NNRTI drug by themselves (Table S2).","While the manuscript discusses resistance to individual ARV drugs and refers to supplemental tables for drug-specific interpretations, the provided main-text excerpt does not list specific drug names administered to participants, so the exact drugs received cannot be extracted from the supplied content."
36851704,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,"Abstract: Protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase genes of HIV-1 were sequenced. Laboratory Procedures: Whole blood specimens were collected by venipuncture in EDTA-containing tubes from participants before initiating or reinitiating ART; plasma specimens were separated and HIV RNA was extracted from 1 mL of plasma and the protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase genes were amplified and sequenced.","The abstract explicitly states that the protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase genes were sequenced. The Methods section describes collecting patient whole blood, separating plasma, extracting viral RNA from participant plasma and performing amplification and sequencing—showing sequences derive from patient samples."
36851704,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No.,"Laboratory Procedures: Protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase HIV genes were amplified and sequenced using in-house-validated protocols and Sanger sequencing was performed on a 3730xl Genetic Analyser. Data Analysis: HIV drug resistance was predicted using the Stanford HIV drug resistance database (HIVdb v 8.9-1) tool; sequences with a penalty score ≥ 15 were considered resistant to a given ARV drug.","The study used genotyping (sequence-based) methods and computational interpretation (Stanford HIVdb) to predict resistance. There is no mention of phenotypic assays or cell-culture in vitro drug susceptibility testing in Methods or Results, so no actual in vitro susceptibility data were reported."
36851704,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No (not reported).,Data Availability Statement: The data presented in this study are available on request from the corresponding author. The manuscript does not provide GenBank accession numbers or state that sequences were deposited in public sequence repositories.,The paper's Data Availability Statement indicates data are available on request and the text contains no GenBank accession numbers or explicit statement of sequence deposition; therefore sequences were not reported as publicly deposited.

36851704,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No (not reported).,"Laboratory Procedures: Protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase HIV genes were amplified and sequenced using in-house-validated protocols. Sanger sequencing was performed on a 3730xl Genetic Analyser. There is no mention of cloning of PCR products or cloning vectors in the Methods.",The Methods describe direct amplification and Sanger sequencing workflows without any cloning steps; absence of any cloning description indicates samples were not cloned prior to sequencing.
36851704,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase.","Abstract: Protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase genes of HIV-1 were sequenced. Laboratory Procedures: Protease (HXB2 positions 6--99), reverse transcriptase (HXB2 positions 1--251), and integrase (HXB2 positions 1--288) HIV genes were amplified and sequenced.","Both the Abstract and Methods explicitly list the three gene regions amplified and sequenced, including HXB2 coordinate ranges."
36851704,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Sanger sequencing (3730xl Genetic Analyser).,"Laboratory Procedures: Sanger sequencing was performed on a 3730xl Genetic Analyser (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA).

36851704,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"Not explicitly reported; sequences were from individuals initiating or reinitiating ART with viral load >1000 copies/mL, some of whom reported prior ARV exposure, but the paper does not state that sequences came from people failing a current regimen.",Participant Enrolment/Results: Adults ≥ 18 years of age diagnosed with HIV initiating or reinitiating ART were eligible and enrolled; all individuals enrolled in the study had an HIV viral load >1000 copies/mL. Results: The proportion of individuals who reported previous exposure to ARV drugs was 35.6%.,"The study enrolled people at the time they were initiating or reinitiating ART and reports high viral loads and prior ARV exposure in some participants. However, the manuscript does not describe sequences coming from individuals currently experiencing virological failure while on a treatment regimen, so virological failure on-treatment is not explicitly documented."
36851704,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No.,Study Design: The Ministry of Health of Uruguay implemented a cross-sectional nationally representative survey following the WHO-recommended methods.

36851760,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,"Dried blood spot (DBS) samples were obtained from one hundred and seven (107) HIV-1-infected children aged less than 15 years old in two West African countries, Benin and Mali. Genetic sequencing of HIV integrase was successful in 75 samples.","The paper describes collection of DBS samples from children and explicitly states that integrase genetic sequencing was performed and successful for 75 samples, indicating that HIV sequences from patient samples were reported."
36851760,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No.,"Target integrase regions of the HIV-1 were subsequently amplified by PCR after reverse-transcription production of complementary DNA (cDNA) and sequenced using the Sanger method.

Seventy-five (75) of the 107 samples were successfully sequenced, assembled, and aligned ...","The Methods specify the collection periods for the two sample sets (2015–2016 in Benin and 2018–2020 in Mali); the successfully sequenced samples come from these collections, so those are the years of sample origin."
36851760,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No.,"Target integrase regions of the HIV-1 were subsequently amplified by PCR after reverse-transcription production of complementary DNA (cDNA) and sequenced using the Sanger method. The HIV-1 subtypes and CRFs were determined according to the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database HIVdb Program, latest version, with a single integrase gene amplification.","The methods describe RT‑PCR and nested PCR amplification followed by direct Sanger sequencing (single integrase gene amplification) and do not mention cloning of PCR products into plasmids prior to sequencing, so samples were not cloned before sequencing."
36851760,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,The integrase gene (HIV-1 integrase).,We determined the prevalence of integrase gene polymorphisms and the frequency of naturally occurring amino acid (aa) substitutions at positions associated with INI resistance. Target integrase regions of the HIV-1 were subsequently amplified by PCR after reverse-transcription production of complementary DNA (cDNA) and sequenced using the Sanger method.,Throughout the manuscript the focus is on sequencing and analyzing the HIV-1 integrase gene; no other HIV genes are reported as sequenced.
36851760,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Sanger sequencing of RT‑PCR and nested PCR amplicons (genotypic sequencing).,"Target integrase regions of the HIV-1 were subsequently amplified by PCR after reverse-transcription production of complementary DNA (cDNA) and sequenced using the Sanger method.

All children were INI-naïve.","The manuscript provides regimen class information but does not list specific ARV drug names (e.g., efavirenz, nevirapine, lamivudine, etc.), so the exact drugs received by participants are not reported."
36694270,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,"The matched CSF and plasma samples of 62 HIV-1 patients were tested at one study site in China (Chongqing; 2019--2022). We amplified the nucleotide sequences of HIV-1 protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase using nested polymerase chain reaction (nest-pcr) method and the amplified product was sequenced.","The paper states that matched CSF and plasma samples from 62 patients were tested and explicitly describes amplification of HIV-1 genes and that the amplified products were sequenced, indicating sequences were obtained from patient samples."
36694270,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No.,"Sequences were then spliced and edited using the Seqman pro and Megalign7.0V software, and were submitted to the drug resistance database of Stanford University (https://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-sequences/ ) for HIV-1 subtypes and resistance mutation analysis. There is no mention of phenotypic or in vitro susceptibility assays in the methods or results.","The authors describe genotypic sequencing and use of the Stanford HIVdb for mutation-based resistance interpretation but do not describe any phenotypic (in vitro) drug susceptibility testing, so only genotypic resistance data are reported."
36694270,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No (not reported).,"Sequences were then spliced and edited using the Seqman pro and Megalign7.0V software, and were submitted to the drug resistance database of Stanford University (https://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-sequences/ ) for HIV-1 subtypes and resistance mutation analysis.

36694270,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,"Sequences were then spliced and edited using the Seqman pro and Megalign7.0V software, and were submitted to the drug resistance database of Stanford University (https://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-sequences/ ) for HIV-1 subtypes and resistance mutation analysis. The manuscript contains no GenBank accession numbers or other sequence accession identifiers.","Although sequencing and database analysis are described, the paper does not list any GenBank or other accession numbers for the sequences, so no accession numbers are available from this paper."
36694270,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,62 individuals.,"As a result, a total of 62 patients were included in this study, and all test reports were recorded. CSF and matched plasma HIV-1 subtypes were confirmed in 62 patients, and the most frequent recombinant form was CRF07-BC (64.5%).","The Patients and methods section states that after excluding six patients with low CSF viral load, 62 patients remained and were analyzed; sequencing/genotyping was performed on these matched CSF and plasma samples."

We retrospectively collected matched pairs of 68 HIV-1 patients who were admitted to Chongqing Public Health Medical Center from June 2020 to June 2022.,"The study was conducted at Chongqing Public Health Medical Center in China and samples were collected from patients admitted there, indicating all sequenced samples originated from China (Chongqing)."
36694270,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,June 2020 to June 2022 (samples collected 2020–2022).,"The matched CSF and plasma samples of 62 HIV-1 patients were tested at one study site in China (Chongqing; 2019--2022). We retrospectively collected matched pairs of 68 HIV-1 patients who were admitted to Chongqing Public Health Medical Center from June 2020 to June 2022 and completed plasma CD4+ T cell counts, HIV RNA viral load, and CSF biochemical tests.","The abstract mentions 2019--2022, but the Patients and methods section explicitly states collection occurred from June 2020 to June 2022; therefore the samples were obtained between 2020 and 2022 (June 2020–June 2022)."
36694270,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No (no cloning reported).,"We amplified the nucleotide sequences of HIV-1 protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase using nested polymerase chain reaction (nest-pcr) method. The target bands were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis for validation, and the amplified product was sequenced.","The methods describe RT-PCR and nested PCR amplification followed by direct sequencing of the amplified products; there is no mention of cloning (e.g., TA cloning or plasmid cloning) prior to sequencing, so cloning was not performed or not reported."
36694270,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase genes.","We amplified the nucleotide sequences of HIV-1 protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase using nested polymerase chain reaction (nest-pcr) method. The amplified product was sequenced and submitted to the drug resistance database of Stanford University for HIV-1 subtypes and resistance mutation analysis.","The methods explicitly list protease, reverse transcriptase (RT), and integrase as the targeted regions for amplification and sequencing, so those genes were sequenced."
36694270,10,What method was used for sequencing?,RT-PCR followed by nested PCR amplification and sequencing of the PCR products (method of sequencing platform not specified).,"The first round of PCR was performed using the HiScript® II One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China), followed by the second round of nested PCR using Ace Taq kit (Vazyme, Nanjing China). The target bands were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis for validation, and the amplified product was sequenced.","The paper describes one-step RT-PCR and nested PCR to amplify HIV gene fragments and then sequencing of the amplified products; however, it does not specify the sequencing platform or whether Sanger versus next-generation sequencing was used, so only the PCR amplification and sequencing of products can be stated."
36694270,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Matched cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples (viral RNA-derived sequences).,"The matched CSF and plasma samples of 62 HIV-1 patients were tested at one study site in China (Chongqing; 2019--2022). We extracted RNA from 00 μL plasma and CFS and amplified the nucleotide sequences of HIV-1 protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase using nested PCR.","The study repeatedly refers to matched CSF and plasma samples being used for HIV genotyping; RNA extraction from plasma and CSF is described, indicating sequencing was performed on viral RNA from those sample types."
36694270,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Yes.,"Among patients receiving ARV treatment, 8/11 (72.7 %) had HIV-1 resistance mutations in both plasma and CSF. The median plasma HIV-1 RNA (IQR) was 5.30 (3.72--5.73) log10 copies/ml in treated patients.","Treated patients had high detectable viral loads and a high proportion (72.7%) harbored resistance mutations in both CSF and plasma, indicating sequencing included individuals on treatment who had ongoing viremia consistent with virological failure."
36694270,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No.,"We retrospectively collected matched pairs of 68 HIV-1 patients who were admitted to Chongqing Public Health Medical Center from June 2020 to June 2022 and completed plasma CD4+ T cell counts, HIV RNA viral load, and CSF biochemical tests. Demographic characteristics (sex, age) and clinical data (diagnosis time, CSF HIV RNA, total protein amount in CSF, CSF glucose, CSF white blood cell count, treatment regimen, plasma CD4 cell count) of these patients were collected and anonymously analysed.","The study design is a retrospective analysis of routine clinical samples from patients admitted to a hospital; there is no mention of enrollment in a clinical trial or trial identifiers, so patients were not part of a clinical trial in this study."
36694270,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes.,"Overall, 62 HIV-1 patients with a median (IQR) age of 51 (38--64) years (51 ARV non- treated, including 49 naive; 11 ARV treated) were analysed. Among patients receiving ARV treatment, 8/11 (72.7 %) had HIV-1 resistance mutations in both plasma and CSF.","The paper explicitly states that 11 of the analyzed patients were ARV-treated and reports sequencing and resistance results for these treated individuals, meaning sequences were obtained from people with prior ARV exposure."
36694270,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs).","Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) were the main drugs used in ARV-treated patients. Among patients receiving ARV treatment, 8/11 (72.7 %) had HIV-1 resistance mutations in both plasma and CSF: PI (n = 1), NRTI (n = 2), NNRTI (n = 1), NRTI+NNRTI (n = 3), NRTI+NNRTI+PI (n = 1).",The results specify the drug-class-level resistance patterns and state NRTIs were the main drugs used; the presence of PI and NNRTI resistance among treated patients indicates those classes were used in regimens prior to sequencing. INSTIs had no resistance detected and are not reported as used in this cohort.
36694270,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Regimens included NRTIs such as lamivudine (3TC) and tenofovir (TDF), NNRTIs such as efavirenz (EFV), and protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r); specific regimen details are not fully enumerated for each patient.","The NRTIs 3TC and TDF in multiple ARV treatment regimens are prone to cause 184 V/I and 65 R mutations; NNRTI EFV is prone to generate Y181C, G190A and K101E mutations; PI LPV/r appears to lead to M46I and V82A mutations. Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) were the main drugs used in ARV-treated patients.","Although the paper does not provide a full patient-by-patient drug list, the discussion and results reference 3TC and TDF (NRTIs), EFV (NNRTI), and LPV/r (PI) as components of regimens and as contributors to observed resistance mutations, indicating these drugs were used among treated individuals."
36920025,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,"No — the reported sequences derive from in vitro cell-culture selections (NL4-3 clone and defined isogenic mutant virus pool), not from patient-derived clinical specimens.","Selections were performed by growing HIV-1 under escalating inhibitor concentration in cell culture starting with virus generated from the NL4-3 clone or a mixture of 26 isogenic viruses each with a single mutation. DNA preparation and amplification: Total cellular DNA was isolated from infected cell pellets by using the QIAamp blood kit (QIAGEN) and PCR products were purified and directly sequenced or cloned. The Methods describe cell-line based selections (CEMx174, 293T, TZM-bl) and preparation of virus stocks from pNL4-3 transfection.","The manuscript repeatedly describes selections performed in cell culture using an NL4-3 infectious molecular clone and a defined pool of isogenic mutant NL4-3 variants; sequencing was performed on material collected from these culture experiments (infected cell pellets and culture supernatants). Although the Primer-ID protocol paragraph says 'Viral RNA was extracted from plasma samples,' the overall experimental context and all selection descriptions indicate these are culture-derived samples rather than clinical/patient-derived samples; no statements identifying human participants or clinical sample donors are provided. Therefore the sequences reported are from in vitro cultured virus, not patient samples."
36920025,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,Yes — the paper reports in vitro viral infectivity EC50 measurements and enzymatic Ki and Km assays for wild-type and mutant proteases.,"The EC50 values (the effective concentration needed at the time of virus production to reduce infectivity by 50%) for DRV and the UMASS analogues ranged from 2.4 to 9.1 nM, significantly more potent than the second- and third-generation PIs tested. We measured enzyme inhibition constants (Ki) of end point PR variants versus catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), and Ki and Km assays are described in Materials and methods (Enzymatic assays: Ki assay and Km assay).","Results and Methods sections explicitly report EC50 values from cell-based viral inhibition assays and detailed enzymatic inhibition (Ki) and catalytic efficiency (Km, kcat/Km) measurements on purified proteases. These are standard in vitro susceptibility/biochemical assays, so the paper provides in vitro drug susceptibility data."
36920025,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,Yes — sequencing data are deposited in the NCBI SRA under BioProject PRJNA853351 and source datasets are available in the Carolina Digital Repository.,"The sequencing data is available at NIH Sequencing Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject ID PRJNA853351. All source data files for enzymatic Ki and Km (Table 1, Figure 2 and 5) and EC50 inhibition curves (Figure 2 and 6) have been uploaded to the Carolina Digital Repository; Sequencing Data for: ...

36920025,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,No GenBank accession numbers are reported in the paper.,"The sequencing data is available at NIH Sequencing Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject ID PRJNA853351. The Data availability and Materials and methods list SRA and Carolina Digital Repository deposits and provide PRJNA853351 and repository citations, but no GenBank accession(s) are listed.","The authors specify deposition of sequencing reads to SRA (BioProject PRJNA853351) and provide links to other repositories for Ki/Km and EC50 datasets, but the text does not include any GenBank accession numbers or statements of GenBank deposit for assembled sequences. Therefore no GenBank accession numbers are reported in this manuscript."
36920025,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,"Not applicable / not reported — sequencing was performed on in vitro cell-culture–derived virus stocks and experimental selections, not on samples from human individuals.",Selections were performed by growing HIV-1 under conditions of escalating inhibitor concentration in cell culture through a lengthy period of selection (50--95 passages) starting with the NL4-3 clone or a mixture of 26 isogenic viruses. Total cellular DNA was isolated from infected cell pellets ... and viral RNA was extracted from plasma samples using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit; sequencing covered the HIV-1 PR region. No number of human participants or clinical donors is provided.,"All experimental descriptions refer to lab cell lines, infectious molecular clone-derived virus stocks, and defined isogenic mutant virus pools that were passaged in culture. There is no indication of human subjects, patient enrollment, or a count of individuals; therefore the question of 'how many individuals' does not apply to this study and no such number is reported."
36920025,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not reported / not applicable — the study used laboratory cell lines and NL4-3–derived virus stocks; no country origins for clinical samples are provided.,"A wild-type virus stock NL4-3 was prepared by transfection of the pNL4-3 plasmid into HeLa cells and selections were performed in cultured cell lines (CEMx174, TZM-bl, 293T). The Data availability section lists SRA BioProject PRJNA853351 and Carolina Digital Repository deposits; no country of sample origin or clinical collection is mentioned.","The experiments are laboratory-based and describe cell culture and clone-derived viruses; the manuscript does not present clinical sampling or state any countries of origin for samples. Consequently, country information is not applicable or reported."
36920025,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not reported — the manuscript does not specify calendar years when sequencing samples were obtained (only repository deposit year citations for datasets).,"The sequencing data is available at NIH Sequencing Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject ID PRJNA853351 and dataset citations include 2022 for Carolina Digital Repository entries. The Methods describe experimental procedures (passages, selection timelines) but do not provide specific calendar years of sample collection.","While dataset records and repository entries are cited (some with 2022 dates in the Data availability section), the paper does not explicitly state the calendar years in which the viral selections or sequencing were performed. Therefore specific sample collection years are not reported in the text."
36920025,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,"Yes — some PCR products were cloned and sequenced, and Primer-ID MiSeq (next-generation) libraries were also generated for deep sequencing.",PCR products were purified by using QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) and directly sequenced or cloned into the pT7Blue vector (Novagen) and sequenced. Primer-ID deep sequencing: We used the PID protocol to prepare MiSeq PID libraries with multiplexed primers ... Gel-purified libraries were pooled and sequenced using the MiSeq 300 base paired-end sequencing protocol (Illumina).,"The Methods explicitly state that amplified protease PCR products were either directly sequenced or cloned into a plasmid vector for sequencing. In addition, the authors used Primer-ID-based deep sequencing on MiSeq for viral RNA, indicating both cloning/Sanger sequencing and NGS approaches were employed."
36920025,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"The HIV-1 protease (PR) coding region was sequenced (by Primer-ID MiSeq and PCR/Sanger), and portions of gag encoding protease cleavage sites (NC/SP2 and SP2/p6) were also sequenced.",Resistance mutations selected in the protease coding domain during the escalating selective pressure ... were examined at various timepoints using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) protocol that included Primer ID with the MiSeq platform. We sequenced the protease cleavage sites encoded in the viral gag gene in the pools of selected viruses where the inhibitor concentration had reached a level of greater than 1 µM.,"Multiple sections describe sequencing and analysis of the protease coding region (PR) and targeted sequencing of gag cleavage-site regions (NC/SP2 and SP2/p6) in selected viral pools. The Primer-ID protocol coverage is specified as the HIV-1 PR region (HXB2 coordinates reported), confirming protease sequencing; gag cleavage-site sequencing is explicitly mentioned in the Results."
36920025,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Both next-generation Primer-ID deep sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform and Sanger sequencing of PCR products (with some PCR products cloned into pT7Blue prior to sequencing) were used.,Resistance mutations ... were examined at various timepoints using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) protocol that included Primer ID with the MiSeq platform. PCR products were purified ... and directly sequenced or cloned into the pT7Blue vector (Novagen) and sequenced.,"The Methods describe preparing MiSeq Primer-ID libraries (Illumina MiSeq 300 bp paired-end) for deep sequencing of the PR region and also indicate that PCR amplicons were either directly sequenced (Sanger) or cloned into plasmid vectors and sequenced. Thus, both NGS (Primer-ID/MiSeq) and conventional cloning/Sanger sequencing approaches were employed."
36920025,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,"Sequencing was performed on viral material derived from the cell-culture selections: total cellular DNA from infected cell pellets, viral RNA (extracted from 'plasma samples' as described in Primer-ID methods, likely referring to culture supernatant-derived viral RNA), and cloned protease genes for expression studies.",Total cellular DNA was isolated from infected cell pellets by using the QIAamp blood kit (QIAgen) and the protease-coding domain of viral DNA was amplified by nested PCR. Viral RNA was extracted from plasma samples using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit ... complemented by Primer-ID MiSeq libraries. The protease variant genes were purchased on a pET11a plasmid ... for expression.,"The Methods indicate sequencing of PCR-amplified protease from infected cell pellets (proviral DNA), Primer-ID sequencing of viral RNA (extracted as described), and sequencing of cloned constructs. The experimental framework is culture-based (infected cell pellets and virus-containing supernatants), so the sample types are culture-derived viral RNA and proviral DNA."
36920025,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No — the sequences were derived from laboratory cell-culture selections of NL4-3 and defined isogenic mutant virus pools, not from patients experiencing treatment failure.","To evaluate the potential of each inhibitor to select for mutations ... we grew HIV-1 under conditions of escalating inhibitor concentration in cell culture through a lengthy period of selection (50--95 passages). A wild-type virus stock NL4-3 was prepared by transfection of the pNL4-3 plasmid ... For the mixture of isogenic mutant viruses, the following NL4-3 variants were created ...",All sequencing and selection experiments are described as performed in vitro using laboratory clones and isogenic mutant virus pools that were passaged in cell culture. There is no description of sequencing from patients failing therapy or clinical virological failure samples; thus sequences from treatment-failure individuals were not obtained.

The Materials and methods detail cell lines (CEMx174, TZM-bl, 293T) and laboratory procedures; no clinical trial or patient enrollment is described.","The manuscript describes laboratory-based virology and biochemical experiments using cell lines and cloned viral genomes; there is no mention of enrolling human subjects, clinical trial identifiers, or clinical trial procedures. Therefore no patients were involved and no clinical trial took place."
36920025,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"No — sequences reported are from in vitro-selected laboratory viruses derived from NL4-3 and defined mutant pools, not from treated individuals.","Selections were carried out starting with the NL4-3 clone or a defined mixture of 26 isogenic NL4-3 protease mutants and grown in cell culture under escalating inhibitor concentrations. The Discussion notes comparisons to sequences in public databases from people with prior PI exposure, but the experimental data in this paper were produced from laboratory selections rather than clinical samples.","Although the Discussion refers to clinical sequence databases and sequences from individuals with prior protease inhibitor exposure, the study's own sequencing data come from laboratory selections and cloned/mutant NL4-3 derivatives; there is no indication that sequences were obtained from ARV-treated human subjects."
36920025,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not applicable — there were no human individuals in the study; only in vitro selections with protease inhibitors (PIs) including darunavir and UMASS PI analogs were used.,"Selections were performed ... with escalating concentrations of: UMass1, UMass2, UMass3, UMass4, UMass5, UMass6, UMass7, UMass8, UMass9, UMass10, DRV, and no drug (ND). The study focuses on HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) and their analogs; no human participants or pre-study ARV exposures are described.","Because the work used laboratory virus stocks and cell-culture selections with protease inhibitors, there are no human participants who had prior ARV exposure in this study. The only drug class present in the experiments is protease inhibitors (PIs), applied in vitro."
36920025,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not applicable — no individuals were sampled; the experimental viruses were exposed in vitro to protease inhibitors (darunavir and the series of UMASS protease inhibitor analogs listed).,"Each flask received one of the following inhibitors at escalating concentrations: UMass1, UMass2, UMass3, UMass4, UMass5, UMass6, UMass7, UMass8, UMass9, UMass10, DRV, and no drug (ND). The assays measured EC50 for DRV and the UMASS analogues and performed selections in cell culture under these inhibitors.","There were no human participants who 'received' drugs; instead, viral populations in cell culture were treated with darunavir (DRV) and ten UMASS PI analogs. Thus, the relevant drugs in the study are those protease inhibitors applied in vitro rather than ARVs received by study participants."
36795586,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,No. The paper does not report HIV sequences from patient samples; HIV genotype testing was not available routinely and only sporadically available on a limited basis.,"Assessment of ART drug resistance mutations via HIV genotype testing was not available as part of routine care at the COEs or pre-switch to DTG. Targeted HIV genotype testing was only sporadically available on a limited basis for CAHLIV failing second-line ART, and these results did not include information on DTG resistance.","The Methods state that HIV genotype testing (which would generate sequence data) was not available as part of routine care and was only sporadically available in a limited fashion for a subset of failing second-line patients. Because routine genotyping was unavailable and there is no presentation of sequence data or genotype results in the results or supplemental materials, the paper does not report HIV sequences from patient samples."
36795586,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No. The paper does not report any in vitro drug susceptibility (phenotypic) data.,"Assessment of ART drug resistance mutations via HIV genotype testing was not available as part of routine care at the COEs or pre-switch to DTG. Routine HIV resistance testing was also unavailable, preventing any conclusions about the impact of NRTI or INSTI RAMs on DTG effectiveness.",The manuscript explicitly states that resistance/genotype testing was not routinely available and that routine HIV resistance testing was unavailable; there is no mention of phenotypic or in vitro susceptibility assays anywhere in the Methods or Results. Therefore no in vitro drug susceptibility data were reported.
36795586,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No. The paper does not indicate that any sequences were made publicly available.,"Assessment of ART drug resistance mutations via HIV genotype testing was not available as part of routine care at the COEs or pre-switch to DTG. Targeted HIV genotype testing was only sporadically available on a limited basis for CAHLIV failing second-line ART, and these results did not include information on DTG resistance.","Because genotyping was not routinely performed and only sporadically available, and because the manuscript does not list any sequence data, accession numbers, or links to sequence repositories, there is no evidence that sequences from this study were deposited or made publicly available."
36795586,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported. No GenBank accession numbers are provided in the paper.,"Assessment of ART drug resistance mutations via HIV genotype testing was not available as part of routine care at the COEs or pre-switch to DTG. Routine HIV resistance testing was also unavailable, preventing any conclusions about the impact of NRTI or INSTI RAMs on DTG effectiveness.",The manuscript makes clear that routine genotyping was not performed and does not present genotype/sequence results or list any accession numbers; therefore no GenBank accession numbers are reported.
36795586,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Not reported. The paper does not provide a count of individuals who had samples obtained specifically for sequencing.,"Assessment of ART drug resistance mutations via HIV genotype testing was not available as part of routine care at the COEs or pre-switch to DTG. The average number of HIV genotype results per year per COE was 12 (range, 0--30), with no DTG resistance testing.","Although the paper notes an average of 12 genotype results per year per COE (range 0–30), it does not provide a total count of individuals who underwent sequencing or genotyping across the study period. Given genotyping was sporadic and not routine, no explicit total number of sequenced individuals is reported."
36795586,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,"If any genotyping was performed, samples would have come from the study countries: Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Tanzania (Mbeya and Mwanza) and Uganda.","COEs included in the study were from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Tanzania-Mbeya, Tanzania-Mwanza and Uganda. Targeted HIV genotype testing was only sporadically available on a limited basis for CAHLIV failing second-line ART, and these results did not include information on DTG resistance.","The study sites (COEs) are listed as being located in Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, two regions of Tanzania, and Uganda. Although genotyping was only sporadically available, any genotype testing performed would have originated from those site countries."
36795586,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Not explicitly reported; the study period was January 2017 to December 2020, so any sporadic genotyping would have occurred within 2017–2020.","We conducted a retrospective cohort study analyzing CALHIV of 0--19 years old and weighing greater than or equal to 20 kg who received DTG as part of their HIV care between January 2017 and December 2020. Targeted HIV genotype testing was only sporadically available on a limited basis for CAHLIV failing second-line ART, and these results did not include information on DTG resistance.","The paper does not state specific dates for any sequencing/genotype tests, but the entire analysis covers January 2017 to December 2020. Therefore, if any genotyping occurred, it would have taken place during that timeframe; however no explicit sequencing dates are provided."
36795586,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not reported. The paper provides no information about cloning of samples prior to sequencing.,"Assessment of ART drug resistance mutations via HIV genotype testing was not available as part of routine care at the COEs or pre-switch to DTG. Targeted HIV genotype testing was only sporadically available on a limited basis for CAHLIV failing second-line ART, and these results did not include information on DTG resistance.","There are no methodological details regarding sequencing workflows (such as cloning, PCR methods, or platforms) provided in the manuscript. Given genotyping was not routine and no sequence methods are described, cloning prior to sequencing is not reported."
36795586,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,Not reported. The paper does not specify any HIV genes that were sequenced.,"Assessment of ART drug resistance mutations via HIV genotype testing was not available as part of routine care at the COEs or pre-switch to DTG. Routine HIV resistance testing was also unavailable, preventing any conclusions about the impact of NRTI or INSTI RAMs on DTG effectiveness.","No genotype/sequence results or methods are presented in the manuscript and no specific genes (e.g., pol, env, gag) are mentioned as being sequenced. Therefore the paper does not report which HIV genes, if any, were sequenced."
36795586,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not reported. No sequencing methodology is described in the paper.,"Assessment of ART drug resistance mutations via HIV genotype testing was not available as part of routine care at the COEs or pre-switch to DTG. Targeted HIV genotype testing was only sporadically available on a limited basis for CAHLIV failing second-line ART, and these results did not include information on DTG resistance.","The Methods section does not include any protocols for sequencing or genotyping (platforms, Sanger vs. NGS, primers, etc.). Because genotyping was uncommon and no sequence data are presented, no sequencing method is reported."
36795586,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Not reported. The paper does not specify the biological sample type used for sequencing.,"Routine and targeted HIV viral load (VL) monitoring was done for all CALHIV across the sites, though VL testing was more limited in availability in the early years of the study compared with later years. Assessment of ART drug resistance mutations via HIV genotype testing was not available as part of routine care at the COEs or pre-switch to DTG.","Although the study reports plasma viral load testing broadly, it does not describe specimen types for genotype testing (e.g., plasma, whole blood, PBMC). Given the absence of genotyping methods or results, the sample type used for sequencing is not reported."
36795586,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"Possibly yes but limited: targeted HIV genotype testing was sporadically available for CALHIV failing second-line ART, so some genotypes (and thus sequences) may have originated from individuals with virological failure, but these were limited and not reported in detail.","Targeted HIV genotype testing was only sporadically available on a limited basis for CAHLIV failing second-line ART, and these results did not include information on DTG resistance. The average number of HIV genotype results per year per COE was 12 (range, 0--30), with no DTG resistance testing.","The Methods explicitly state that targeted genotyping occurred sporadically for children failing second-line therapy, which implies that some genotype tests (and potential sequences) were performed on individuals with virological failure. However, these tests were limited in number and the results (including any sequences) are not presented in the paper."
36795586,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No. The study was a retrospective real-world cohort analysis of patients in routine clinical care, not a clinical trial.","Retrospective analysis was performed among CALHIV 0--19 years old and weighing greater than or equal to 20 kg who received DTG from 2017 to 2020 at sites in Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda. We conducted a retrospective cohort study analyzing CALHIV of 0--19 years old and weighing greater than or equal to 20 kg who received DTG as part of their HIV care between January 2017 and December 2020.","The manuscript repeatedly describes the study as a retrospective cohort analysis of routine programmatic care within BIPAI centers, indicating that patients were receiving standard clinical care rather than being enrolled in a prospective clinical trial."
36795586,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"No sequences are reported. However, the cohort included many ART-experienced individuals and targeted genotyping (when done) was sometimes for those failing second-line ART.","The cohort included new ART initiations using a DTG-based ART and ART-experienced patients who shifted to a DTG-based regimen (irrespective of virologic status). Targeted HIV genotype testing was only sporadically available on a limited basis for CAHLIV failing second-line ART, and these results did not include information on DTG resistance.","While the population included ART-experienced participants and any sporadic genotyping focused on those failing second-line therapy (who had prior ARV exposure), the paper does not present sequence data from these individuals. Thus the paper does not report sequences from previously treated patients, although such genotyping may have occurred in a limited, unreported manner."
36795586,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Reported prior drug classes in the cohort include NRTIs (as backbone), NNRTIs and protease inhibitors (PIs); many patients were shifted from NNRTI-based regimens or had prior PI-based ART.","The cohort included patients shifted from NNRTI-based regimen, used a TLD formulation, were 50.9% female. Single drug substitutions (SDS) were defined as an ART regimen change in which the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone remained the same, and the only change was from the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI) or protease inhibitor (PI) to DTG. The NRTI backbone in the SDS was abacavir-based in 44.4%, tenofovir-based in 38.9% and zidovudine-based in 16.7%.","The manuscript explicitly describes prior regimens and SDS definitions, naming NRTI backbones and that the anchor drugs switched were NNRTIs or PIs. Therefore the drug classes received prior to (possible) genotyping included NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs."
36795586,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"The paper reports specific commonly used drugs/regimens in the cohort: tenofovir-lamivudine-dolutegravir (TLD) was widely used; NRTI backbones prior to DTG included abacavir-based, tenofovir-based and zidovudine-based regimens. Prior anchor drugs included NNRTIs and protease inhibitors (specific NNRTIs or PIs are not listed).","Available formulations of DTG were the 50 mg DTG tablet or the single tab, fixed-dose combination of tenofovir-lamivudine-DTG (TLD), which limited the use of DTG to CALHIV weighing more than 20 kg. The NRTI backbone in the SDS was abacavir-based in 44.4% (1180/2665), tenofovir-based in 38.9% (1032/2665) and zidovudine-based in 16.7% (443/2665). Single drug substitutions (SDS) were defined as an ART regimen change in which the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone remained the same, and the only change was from the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI) or protease inhibitor (PI) to DTG.","The manuscript names the TLD fixed-dose combination (tenofovir+lamivudine+dolutegravir) and breaks down the NRTI backbones used in SDS (abacavir-, tenofovir-, zidovudine-based). While NNRTIs and PIs are repeatedly referenced as prior anchor drugs, specific NNRTI or PI drug names are not provided. Therefore the listed drugs include tenofovir, lamivudine, dolutegravir, abacavir and zidovudine (and unspecified NNRTIs/PIs as prior anchors)."
36931676,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,"HIV drug resistance (including viral sequences) results, described as both mutations and predicted phenotypic sensitivity, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts and CD4/CD8 ratios are either automatically or manually included depending on the HIV centre. Also, since all viral (pol) sequences are stored in the database, reanalysis can easily be performed when new drugs or new information about resistance appear.","The text explicitly states that viral sequences (including pol sequences) are part of the HIV drug resistance results captured in the registry and that all viral (pol) sequences are stored in the database, which indicates the paper reports HIV sequences obtained from patient samples."
36931676,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No direct in vitro susceptibility data are reported; the paper reports predicted phenotypic sensitivity.,"HIV drug resistance (including viral sequences) results, described as both mutations and predicted phenotypic sensitivity, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts and CD4/CD8 ratios are either automatically or manually included depending on the HIV centre. The paper describes reanalysis of sequences when new drugs or new information about resistance appear.","The manuscript refers to 'predicted phenotypic sensitivity' derived from resistance data but does not describe performing or reporting in vitro phenotypic susceptibility assays; therefore only predicted (in silico or algorithm-derived) phenotypic sensitivity is indicated, not direct in vitro susceptibility testing."
36931676,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,"No — sequences are stored in the registry and data (including sequences) are available upon reasonable request and after ethical approval, but no public deposition is reported.","Since all viral (pol) sequences are stored in the database, reanalysis can easily be performed when new drugs or new information about resistance appear. Data are available upon reasonable request. Data can be made available upon reasonable request and after ethical approval.","While the registry stores viral sequences and allows reanalysis, the Data availability statement specifies that data are available upon reasonable request (and after ethical approval).

Data are available upon reasonable request. Data can be made available upon reasonable request and after ethical approval.",The paper describes sequence storage in the registry and data-sharing procedures but does not list any GenBank (or other public) accession numbers; therefore no accession numbers are reported in the manuscript.

Since 2008 the cohort has had complete national coverage. Retrospective data from before the cohort was established as nation-wide in 2008 has been backlogged, including PLHIV deceased before 2008. To date (August 2022), 13 029 PLHIV have been included.","The paper does not state explicit years during which sequencing was performed, but the cohort's establishment in 2003, retrospective backlog before 2008, and data current to August 2022 imply that stored sequences could span from before 2008 through 2022; however, exact sequencing years are not provided."

HIV drug resistance (including viral sequences) results ... are either automatically or manually included depending on the HIV centre.","While the registry stores viral sequences, the paper does not directly link sequencing to a specific specimen type; it does list the types of biological samples collected into biobanks, which are the likely sources of sequences (plasma/serum, CSF, PBMCs, isolates)."
36931676,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"Not explicitly stated; the registry includes treatment-experienced patients and drug-resistance data, so sequences may include individuals with virological failure but the paper does not specifically report this.","Almost all are on ART (98%), and of them almost everybody (95%) reaches the treatment goal of HIV-RNA <50 copies/mL (98% HIV-RNA <200 copies/mL) in snapshot analysis after at least 6 months of treatment. Sönnerborg et al have also studied HIV drug resistance, both transmitted and acquired, and the molecular HIV epidemiology.","The paper documents that most cohort members are on ART and that the registry contains HIV drug resistance data (both transmitted and acquired), which implies sequences from treated and possibly failing individuals exist in the database. However, the manuscript does not explicitly state that sequences were obtained specifically from individuals with virological failure on treatment."
36931676,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No, this is a prospective registry-based cohort (not a clinical trial).","Cohort profile: InfCareHIV, a prospective registry-based cohort study of people with diagnosed HIV in Sweden. The InfCareHIV cohort was established in 2003 ... since 2008 the cohort has had complete national coverage, including all 29 clinical HIV centres in Sweden.","The manuscript describes InfCareHIV as a registry-based cohort used for routine clinical care, quality registry purposes and research; it is not described as a clinical trial."

Amplicons were purified and quantified as previously described. From the same blood samples used to assess blood plasma, NGS of HIV partial pol was performed to identify DRMs present in archived proviral DNA (peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)).","The Methods describe PCR and nested PCR amplification followed by direct sequencing (NGS or bulk genotyping) and purification of amplicons; there is no mention of molecular cloning of amplicons prior to sequencing, so cloning was not performed."
36961945,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) (partial pol) were sequenced; the Methods state PR, RT and integrase (IN) were targeted by the assay, but the Discussion notes integrase (INSTI) sequencing/data were not investigated due to lack of data.","Bulk genotyping of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) was performed to identify transmitted drug resistance (GeneSeq HIV ... or Viroseq v.2.0) in blood plasma before ART initiation.

Participants were screened for NNRTI, NRTI, and PI mutations in blood plasma at baseline (bulk genotyping) before ART initiation.","Because sequencing was performed on ART-naïve participants before they started therapy, no antiretroviral drug classes had been received prior to the sequencing."
36961945,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,None. Participants were antiretroviral-naïve at the time of sampling and sequencing.,"We investigated whether deep sequencing of archived HIV DNA of antiretroviral-naïve persons with acute/early HIV infection could identify transmitted drug resistance mutations (DRM). Participants were screened for NNRTI, NRTI, and PI mutations in blood plasma at baseline (bulk genotyping) before ART initiation.","The study sampled and sequenced participants prior to ART initiation; therefore no individual had received specific antiretroviral drugs before the sequencing. (The paper does note that 137 participants later started ART that included 3TC or FTC, but that occurred after baseline sampling.)"
37029656,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,"We conducted a time-trend, single-centre study over the period 2009--19 on adult naive PLWH with a genotypic resistance test (GRT) performed before the ART initiation. GRT was determined by Sanger sequencing using an ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).","The paper states that genotypic resistance testing (GRT) was performed on ART-naive people living with HIV and that GRT was determined by Sanger sequencing, which indicates sequencing of HIV from patient samples was performed."
37029656,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No.,"The degree of resistance to each INSTI drug was calculated using the Genotypic Resistance Interpretation Algorithm of the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database Program (version 9.1.1). GRT was determined by Sanger sequencing using an ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).",Resistance was inferred from genotypic data using the Stanford algorithm rather than measured by phenotypic/in vitro susceptibility assays; the manuscript does not describe any in vitro phenotypic susceptibility testing.
37029656,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,Not reported / No indication of public sequence deposition.,"Table S1 , available as Supplementary data at JAC Online. There is no mention of GenBank accession numbers or deposition of sequences in the provided content.","The paper refers to a supplementary table but does not state that sequence data were deposited in public repositories (e.g., GenBank) nor provides accession numbers in the provided text, so public availability is not reported."
37029656,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,"Table S1 , available as Supplementary data at JAC Online. There is no mention of GenBank accession numbers or deposition of sequences in the provided content.",The manuscript text provided does not list any GenBank accession numbers or other sequence identifiers; therefore no accession numbers are reported.
37029656,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,1223 individuals.,"Overall, 1223 ART-naive PLWH were evaluated: 1109 (90.7%) were male, 860 (70.3%) were MSM and the median age was 37 (IQR, 30--45) years. we included in the analysis the immediate pre-ART GRT available in people newly diagnosed with HIV infection.","The paper reports evaluation of 1223 ART-naive people living with HIV with genotypic resistance tests performed before ART, indicating sequencing was carried out on samples from 1223 individuals."
37029656,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Primarily Italy (patients of Italian origin); samples are from a single centre in Italy.,"Italian origin was found in 578 (78.0%). We conducted a time-trend, single-centre study over the period 2009--19 on adult naive PLWH with a genotypic resistance test (GRT) performed before the ART initiation.","The study is described as single-centre and reports that a majority of participants were of Italian origin, implying samples were collected in Italy; no other countries of sample origin are specified in the provided text."
37029656,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,2009–2019.,"We conducted a time-trend, single-centre study over the period 2009--19 on adult naive PLWH with a genotypic resistance test (GRT) performed before the ART initiation. Over the decade 2009--19, the prevalence of at least low-level and intermediate INSTI DR among ART-naive PLWH with an available GRT performed before starting ART has mildly increased...","The study period is explicitly given as 2009--19, indicating sequenced samples were obtained during 2009 to 2019."
37029656,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not reported / No indication that samples were cloned prior to sequencing.,"GRT was determined by Sanger sequencing using an ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). There is no mention of cloning of samples prior to sequencing in the provided content.",The methods state Sanger sequencing but do not describe cloning steps; absence of any cloning description indicates cloning was not reported.
37029656,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,Integrase (INSTI region) was sequenced; the study focuses on integrase genotypic resistance (pol/integrase region).,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence trend of transmitted INSTI drug resistance (DR) and to assess factors associated with transmitted INSTI resistance among ART-naive PLWH over the past decade. Major INSTI resistance mutations were uncommon; both E138K and R263K were found in 2 (0.2%) people, while each of G118R, G140S, Y143C, Y143R, S147G and Q148H in 1 (0.1%).","The paper reports detection of numerous INSTI-associated mutations and focuses on transmitted INSTI resistance, which indicates sequencing of the integrase gene (part of pol) was performed; specific other genes are not explicitly listed in the provided text."
37029656,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Sanger sequencing using an ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzer.,"GRT was determined by Sanger sequencing using an ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The degree of resistance to each INSTI drug was calculated using the Genotypic Resistance Interpretation Algorithm of the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database Program (version 9.1.1).",The methods section explicitly states that Sanger sequencing on an ABI PRISM 3130xl instrument was used to determine genotypic resistance.

37029656,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,No.,"We conducted a time-trend, single-centre study over the period 2009--19 on adult naive PLWH with a genotypic resistance test (GRT) performed before the ART initiation. Overall, 1223 ART-naive PLWH were evaluated...","All participants were ART-naive and GRTs were performed before ART initiation, so sequences were not obtained from individuals experiencing virological failure on treatment."
37029656,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No.,"We conducted a time-trend, single-centre study over the period 2009--19 on adult naive PLWH with a genotypic resistance test (GRT) performed before the ART initiation. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence trend of transmitted INSTI drug resistance (DR) and to assess factors associated with transmitted INSTI resistance among ART-naive PLWH over the past decade.","The study is described as a time-trend, single-centre observational study rather than a clinical trial; no trial enrollment or randomization is mentioned."
37029656,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No.,"We conducted a time-trend, single-centre study over the period 2009--19 on adult naive PLWH with a genotypic resistance test (GRT) performed before the ART initiation. Overall, 1223 ART-naive PLWH were evaluated...","Participants are explicitly described as ART-naive, meaning they had not previously received antiretroviral drugs prior to sequencing."
37029656,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,None (participants were ART-naive).,"We conducted a time-trend, single-centre study over the period 2009--19 on adult naive PLWH with a genotypic resistance test (GRT) performed before the ART initiation. Overall, 1223 ART-naive PLWH were evaluated...","Because all participants were ART-naive and sequencing/GRT was performed before ART initiation, no antiretroviral drug classes had been received prior to sampling."

Overall, 1223 ART-naive PLWH were evaluated...","The cohort consisted of ART-naive individuals and GRT was done prior to ART start, so no specific antiretroviral drugs were received before sequencing."
36967989,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes. The study used genotype data (patient-derived viral isolates) from the Stanford HIV drug resistance database.,"Filtered genotype-phenotype data on the Stanford HIV drug resistance database was retrieved for PIs (Das & Arnold, 2013). For the HIV-1 PI: 1218 isolates for atazanavir (ATV), 678 isolates for darunavir (DRV), 1809 isolates for fosemprenavir (FPV), 1,860 isolates for indinavir (IDV), 1,562 isolates for lopinavir (LPV), 1907 isolates for nelfinavir (NFV), 1,861 isolates for saquinavir (SQV) and 908 isolates for tipranavir (TPV) have been analyzed for PI susceptibility.",The paper explicitly states that it retrieved 'genotype-phenotype data' from the Stanford HIV drug resistance database and reports numbers of isolates analyzed per protease inhibitor. That indicates the study used sequence/genotype data derived from patient viral isolates (population-level viral sequences) rather than reporting only purely in silico chemical data.
36967989,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,Yes. The study used genotype-phenotype data including fold-change in drug susceptibility (IC50/fold-change) from PhenoSense assay results.,"The filtered PhenoSense assay results made accessible in the Stanford HIV drug resistance database have been used training and testing machine learning models. The paper refers to 'fold change' values and to IC50 (e.g., 'molecules with determined IC50 values in mutant viruses' and use of fold-change as the model output).",The authors state they used PhenoSense assay results (a cell-based in vitro phenotypic susceptibility assay) and repeatedly refer to fold-change and IC50 values as the phenotype/endpoints modeled. These are standard in vitro drug susceptibility measurements.
36967989,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,"Partially. The processed data and code used in the study are made available on GitHub and Zenodo, and the underlying genotype-phenotype data originate from the publicly accessible Stanford HIV drug resistance database, but the paper does not report new sequence depositions (e.g., GenBank accessions).","All data and necessary codes are available at Github and Zenodo: https://github.com/tnchsyn/hivdrugisolatefoldchange_model ; tnchsyn.

Filtered genotype-phenotype data on the Stanford HIV drug resistance database was retrieved for PIs (Das & Arnold, 2013).","The Data Availability section declares that data and code are shared on GitHub/Zenodo, and the Methods say the genotype-phenotype data were taken from the Stanford database (which is public). However, nowhere in the paper are new sequence accession numbers or deposits to public sequence repositories (e.g., GenBank) reported, so no novel sequence deposition is provided."
36967989,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported. The paper does not provide GenBank accession numbers for isolates.,All data and necessary codes are available at Github and Zenodo: https://github.com/tnchsyn/hivdrugisolatefoldchange_model ; tnchsyn. (2023). tnchsyn/hivdrugisolatefoldchange_model: v1.0 (v1.0). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7527918. The paper describes retrieval of filtered genotype-phenotype data from the Stanford HIV drug resistance database but does not list GenBank accession identifiers.,"Although the authors state where the datasets and code can be obtained, the manuscript contains no GenBank accession numbers or any explicit sequence accession listings. The genotype data source is the Stanford database rather than newly deposited GenBank records."
36967989,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,"The paper reports numbers of isolates analyzed per protease inhibitor: ATV 1,218; DRV 678; FPV 1,809; IDV 1,860; LPV 1,562; NFV 1,907; SQV 1,861; TPV 908.

In the dataset, 436, 336, 480, 483, 472, 486, 489 and 409 different mutations have been observed for ATV, DRV, FPV, IDV, LPV, NFV, SQV, and TPV, respectively.","The Methods section lists the number of isolates analyzed for each protease inhibitor, which are counts of isolate–drug genotype-phenotype entries. The paper does not state a single total number of unique individuals (some isolates may be shared across drugs), so only the per-drug isolate counts can be extracted directly."
36967989,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not reported. The paper does not specify the countries of origin for the sequences/isolates.,"Filtered genotype-phenotype data on the Stanford HIV drug resistance database was retrieved for PIs (Das & Arnold, 2013). The manuscript provides counts of isolates per PI and mutation counts but does not mention geographic or country information for the isolates.","Although the source database (Stanford HIVdb) can include geographic metadata, this paper does not extract or report country-level provenance of the isolates; no country names or locations are given in the text."
36967989,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not reported. The paper does not provide sampling years or date ranges for the sequences/isolates.,"The manuscript describes the dataset as 'Filtered genotype-phenotype data on the Stanford HIV drug resistance database' and gives isolate counts, but contains no statements about collection years or date ranges for the sequences.","There is no mention of sampling dates or time periods in the Methods, Results, or Data Availability sections, so the years of sample collection cannot be determined from this paper."
36967989,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not reported. The paper does not describe any cloning of samples prior to sequencing.,"The Methods describe retrieval of genotype-phenotype data from the Stanford HIV drug resistance database and discuss that 'genotype-fold change measurements are made on population of viruses, so that it is possible to find two separate mutations for a single residue.' There is no description of cloning procedures or single-genome/clonal sequencing.","The authors explicitly note that genotype-fold-change measurements are population-based, implying bulk/population sequencing rather than cloned single-genome approaches, but they do not describe any cloning or sequencing laboratory methods because they used database-derived data. Therefore no cloning prior to sequencing is reported."
36967989,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,Protease (PR) gene sequences (HIV-1 protease) were used.,"Prediction of HIV-1 protease resistance using genotypic, phenotypic, and molecular information with artificial neural networks. Filtered genotype-phenotype data on the Stanford HIV drug resistance database was retrieved for PIs ... A total of 498 protease mutations have been observed.","The study focuses throughout on protease inhibitors and repeatedly refers to 'protease mutations' and 'HIV-1 protease' resistance, indicating that the genotype data correspond to the protease (PR) gene."
36967989,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not reported. The manuscript does not describe sequencing laboratory methods; it used genotype data retrieved from the Stanford HIV drug resistance database without specifying how those sequences were originally obtained.,"Filtered genotype-phenotype data on the Stanford HIV drug resistance database was retrieved for PIs (Das & Arnold, 2013). The Methods describe data representation and machine learning steps but do not include laboratory sequencing methodology.","Because the authors used pre-existing genotype-phenotype data from a public database and focused on computational modeling, they did not provide details of sequencing platforms or protocols in this paper."
36967989,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Patient-derived viral isolates (population-level viral sequences) from clinical samples; genotype-fold change measurements were population-based isolates.,"For the HIV-1 PI: ... isolates for atazanavir (ATV) ... have been analyzed for PI susceptibility. It is important to note that, the genotype-fold change measurements are made on population of viruses, so that it is possible to find two separate mutations for a single residue.","The text repeatedly refers to 'isolates' and clarifies that genotype–fold-change measurements are made on populations of viruses, indicating that the sequence data represent viral isolates from patient samples (bulk population sequencing) rather than cloned single genomes or purely synthetic sequences."
36967989,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Not reported. The paper does not state whether isolates came specifically from individuals with virological failure.,"The manuscript describes retrieval of genotype-phenotype data from the Stanford HIV drug resistance database and presents counts of isolates per PI, but contains no statements about clinical virological failure status of the donors of those isolates.","Although resistance data (fold-change) often derive from treated or failing patients, the authors did not provide clinical status (e.g., virological failure) for the isolates in the dataset within this paper, so this cannot be confirmed from the text."
36967989,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,Not reported. The paper does not indicate that patients were enrolled in a clinical trial; data were obtained from an external database.,"Filtered genotype-phenotype data on the Stanford HIV drug resistance database was retrieved for PIs (Das & Arnold, 2013). The study focuses on building ANN models from database-derived genotype-phenotype records and does not describe any clinical trial enrollment or trial identifiers.","The work is a secondary analysis of public genotype-phenotype data rather than a prospective clinical study; no mention of clinical trial participation, trial names, or trial registries appears in the manuscript."
36967989,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Not explicitly reported. The paper does not provide explicit statements about prior antiretroviral treatment histories for the individuals whose isolates were in the dataset.,"The manuscript uses 'filtered genotype-phenotype data on the Stanford HIV drug resistance database' and discusses protease inhibitor resistance and mutations, but it does not describe prior ARV exposure or treatment histories of the isolates' donors.","Although genotype-phenotype entries in Stanford HIVdb often originate from treated patients, the authors did not report or tabulate prior ARV exposure for the isolates in their dataset within this paper, so this information is not available here."
36967989,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not reported. The paper does not provide patient-level antiretroviral treatment-class histories.,"The paper details analysis of protease inhibitor (PI) genotype-phenotype data and lists specific PIs analyzed, but does not present treatment-class histories (e.g., NRTI, NNRTI, PI) for the individuals for whom isolates were obtained.",No sections of the manuscript report ARV class exposure per patient or per isolate; the focus is on modeling fold-change for protease inhibitors using genotype data rather than describing prior therapy histories.
36967989,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not reported. The paper does not report individual-level prior drug names or regimens for the isolates; only the protease inhibitors analyzed in the dataset are listed.,"The study lists the eight protease inhibitors used in modeling (atazanavir, darunavir, fosemprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir and tipranavir) and reports numbers of isolates per PI, but does not state which drugs individual patients had previously received.","Although the dataset concerns measurements of these PIs against various isolates, the manuscript does not include patient drug-exposure metadata (specific prior drugs or regimens), so no per-patient drug history can be extracted from the paper."
36982978,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,No — this is a review article and does not report original HIV sequences from patient samples.,"Here, we review the therapeutic armamentarium available to treat HIV-2-infected patients, as well as promising drugs in development. The data presented in this study are available in this article.","The text repeatedly frames the work as a review (""Here, we review...""), rather than a primary research report of new patient-derived sequences. The Data Availability Statement indicates that the data are those presented in the article (summary/review), and no sections describe collection of patient samples, sequencing methods, or presentation of new sequence data, so the paper does not report original patient sequences."
36982978,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,"Yes — the review reports and summarizes in vitro susceptibility/phenotypic data from cited studies (EC50/IC50 values), but it does not present new experimental susceptibility data generated by the authors.","Roquebert et al. demonstrated that RAL was a potent inhibitor of HIV-2 clinical isolates (IC50 = 1.3--5 nM). Link et al. showed that GS-6207 was active against two HIV-2 isolates (CBL20 and CDC310319) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but less so compared to HIV-1 (mean EC50 = 885 pM).","Although this paper is a review, it contains multiple reported in vitro potency values (IC50/EC50) and summarizes phenotypic study results from the literature (examples cited above). Therefore the article reports in vitro susceptibility data by synthesizing results from prior experimental studies, not by reporting new experiments conducted in this work."
36982978,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No — the paper does not report depositing any sequences in public databases.,"Here, we review the therapeutic armamentarium available to treat HIV-2-infected patients, as well as promising drugs in development. The data presented in this study are available in this article.","The article is a review and contains no GenBank accession numbers or statements that sequence data generated by the authors were deposited in public repositories.

Because this is a review article and no original sequences were generated or deposited, there are no accession numbers to report."
36982978,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Not applicable — the review did not obtain samples for sequencing (no individuals sampled in this study).,"Here, we review the therapeutic armamentarium available to treat HIV-2-infected patients, as well as promising drugs in development. The data presented in this study are available in this article.","The manuscript is a literature review summarizing published work; it does not describe enrolling participants or obtaining patient samples for sequencing in this study, so there are zero individuals sampled by the authors for sequencing."

A recent non-randomized clinical trial in Senegal showed that a once-daily, single-tablet-regimen of Stribild is safe, effective, and well tolerated by HIV-2-infected patients.","While the review discusses studies performed in different countries (e.g., Senegal, Spain, India cited in the text), the review itself did not collect sequenced samples, so there are no countries associated with samples generated by this paper. The cited country examples are from the literature summarized by the authors."
36982978,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable — the review does not report original sample collection years for sequenced isolates.,"Here, we review the therapeutic armamentarium available to treat HIV-2-infected patients, as well as promising drugs in development. The data presented in this study are available in this article.",No methods or results sections describe original sample collection dates; the paper summarizes results from many studies spanning years but does not provide specific collection years for sequences generated by the authors.
36982978,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not applicable — the paper does not report generating or sequencing samples and therefore does not describe cloning prior to sequencing.,"Here, we review the therapeutic armamentarium available to treat HIV-2-infected patients, as well as promising drugs in development. The data presented in this study are available in this article.","There is no methods section describing cloning or sequencing workflows for samples generated by this work. The article is a review and does not perform primary cloning/sequencing, so this question is not applicable to the paper itself."
36982978,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"The review discusses sequences and resistance mutations in multiple HIV genes from the literature, specifically reverse transcriptase (RT), protease (PR), integrase (IN), gag (capsid/CA) and env (V3/envelope) regions, but it did not itself sequence these genes.","Since proviral DNA synthesis is essential in the HIV replicative cycle, RT has been one of the main targets of ARVs. The HIV protease (PR) is an important target in the treatment of HIV infection due to its role in the proteolytic processing of the precursor Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins during virus maturation. A recent meta-analysis showed that Q91R, E92A/Q, T97A, G140S, Y143G, Q148R, A153G, N155H, H156R and an R231 5-amino acid insertion are the most frequent treatment-selected nonpolymorphic mutations in the integrase (Table 1).","Although the authors did not generate new sequence data, the review summarizes mutational data and resistance pathways involving RT, PR, IN and also mentions Gag (capsid mutations associated with lenacapavir resistance) and Env (V3/tropism) from cited studies, indicating which genes are discussed in the sequenced literature."
36982978,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not reported for this paper — no sequencing methods were described because the article is a review and did not perform new sequencing.,"Here, we review the therapeutic armamentarium available to treat HIV-2-infected patients, as well as promising drugs in development. The data presented in this study are available in this article.","There is no methods section detailing sequencing technology (Sanger, NGS, cloning, etc.) used by the authors. The paper synthesizes findings from multiple studies, but does not describe a sequencing method employed in this work."
36982978,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,"Not applicable — the review did not sequence any samples; it summarizes results from studies that used clinical viral isolates, primary isolates, and molecular clones, but did not itself sequence sample types.","Roquebert et al. demonstrated that RAL was a potent inhibitor of HIV-2 clinical isolates (IC50 = 1.3--5 nM). Using site-directed mutagenesis of a HIV-2ROD molecular clone, it was shown that high levels of resistance to festinavir requires the combination of Q151M and M184V.","While the review mentions that other studies used clinical isolates and molecular clones, the authors themselves did not report sequencing particular sample types; thus there are no sample types sequenced by this paper to report."
36982978,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No sequences were obtained in this paper; however, the review discusses sequences and resistance mutations reported in the literature from individuals failing therapy (e.g., patients failing RAL-based regimens).","Descamps et al. studied 13 HIV-2-infected adults failing a RAL-based therapy who received DTG 50 mg twice daily. In this study, undetectable viraemia was also observed in 37% of ART-experienced patients, and 80% of patients presenting virological failure exhibited drug resistance mutations.","The article itself did not generate sequence data, but it cites studies that reported sequences from patients with virological failure. Therefore, while no sequences were obtained by the review authors, the literature summarized includes sequences from treatment-failing individuals."
36982978,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No — the paper is a review and did not enroll patients; it cites clinical trials and observational studies from the literature but did not conduct a trial itself.,"Here, we review the therapeutic armamentarium available to treat HIV-2-infected patients, as well as promising drugs in development. In a phase 2 non-comparative trial, 87% of drug-naïve HIV-2-infected patients treated with a RAL-based regimen achieved, at week 48, a viral load < 5 copies/mL.","The manuscript summarizes results from randomized and non-randomized clinical trials in the literature, but contains no methods or participant enrollment indicating that the authors ran a clinical trial; thus the paper itself did not include patients enrolled in a trial."
36982978,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"No — the review does not present original sequences from previously treated individuals, though it discusses literature reporting sequences from treatment-experienced patients.","More recently, in a phase 2 non-comparative trial, 87% of drug-naïve HIV-2-infected patients treated with a RAL-based regimen achieved, at week 48, a viral load < 5 copies/mL and 40% of the patients gained > 100 CD4 T cells/µL. In this study, undetectable viraemia was also observed in 37% of ART-experienced patients, and 80% of patients presenting virological failure exhibited drug resistance mutations.",The article is a review and did not generate or deposit sequences from treated patients; it references other studies that examined sequences from ARV-experienced individuals but does not itself report such sequences.

Quantified amplicons were sequenced using the MiSeq V3 sequencing Kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA). In the event of PCR non-amplification or next-generation sequencing failure, a smaller amplicon was attempted ... and sequenced using Sanger sequencing technologies.","The Methods describe Illumina MiSeq-based NGS (with Nextera XT library prep) as the primary sequencing approach and Sanger sequencing as a backup for failed amplifications/sequencing, so both methods were used as described."
37017009,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma derived from whole blood (minimum 500 μL plasma) was used for nucleic acid extraction and sequencing.,"Whole blood was collected using standard phlebotomy methods into a 6 mL EDTA tube. A minimum of 500 μL plasma was ultra-centrifuged and total nucleic acid extracted using the MagNA Pure 2.0 automated extraction system (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany).","The Methods describe collection of whole blood and extraction of nucleic acid from plasma, indicating that plasma specimens (from patient blood draws) were the material sequenced."
37017009,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"Yes. Inclusion required recent evidence of virological failure (viral load ≥1000 copies/mL) in children on ART, and sequences were obtained from those participants.","The study targeted HIV-positive children aged ≤19 years who were receiving ART ... and had suggestive evidence of VF (defined as at least one recent VL test performed that was ≥1000 copies/mL). Of 899 specimens included in the analysis, genotyping PCR and sequencing was successful in 809 (809/899, 90.0%).","Eligibility required participants to be on ART with recent virological failure, and the Results confirm that specimens from these participants were genotyped/sequenced, so sequences were obtained from individuals with virological failure while on treatment."
37017009,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No. This was a cross-sectional facility-based observational study, not a clinical trial.","This cross-sectional study, performed from March 2017 to March 2019 in South Africa, enrolled HIV-positive children ... A cross-sectional facility-based study with retrospective record review was conducted using a stratified cluster sampling approach.","The Methods repeatedly describe the design as a cross-sectional facility-based study with retrospective record review and survey sampling; there is no indication of a randomized clinical trial or interventional trial, so patients were not in a clinical trial."
37017009,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes. Participants were on ART for at least one year and prior/current regimen information (including PMTCT exposure) was collected and reported.,"To be eligible for inclusion in the study, the children had to be aged ≤19 years, on ART for a minimum of 1 year (±3 months) ... Key variables collected included ... current regimen, previous regimen, other medicines taken, maternal and paediatric PMTCT received. Documented PMTCT exposure was reported in 163/433 (37.6%) of participants.","Eligibility required being on ART (i.e., prior/current ARV exposure), and the data collection included previous regimens and PMTCT exposure; therefore sequences came from individuals who had received ARV drugs."
37017009,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Participants had received protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimens, and nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-only regimens.","A total of 418 children were receiving PI-based regimens, constituting 48.4% ... Four hundred and twenty-two participants were receiving NNRTI-based regimens (45.0% ...). A total of 55 (6.5% ...) participants were receiving NRTI-only-based regimens.","The Results explicitly categorize participants by regimen class (PI-based, NNRTI-based, and NRTI-only), indicating those drug classes were received prior to sequencing."
37017009,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Reported drugs included ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (majority of PI regimens), ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (minority), efavirenz (majority of NNRTI regimens), nevirapine (few), lamivudine, abacavir, zidovudine, emtricitabine, stavudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (as components of NRTI regimens).","The majority were receiving ritonavir-boosted lopinavir-based regimens (97.1%), whilst 2.9% were receiving ritonavir-boosted atazanavir. The majority were receiving efavirenz-based regimens (98.7%); seven participants were receiving nevirapine. These included lamivudine only (n = 21), abacavir + lamivudine (n = 18) and abacavir only (n = 2), whilst the remainder were combinations of zidovudine, lamivudine, emtricitabine, stavudine and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.","The Results list the predominant specific drugs used within each regimen class (e.g., ritonavir-boosted lopinavir and atazanavir for PIs; efavirenz and nevirapine for NNRTIs; lamivudine, abacavir, zidovudine, emtricitabine, stavudine, tenofovir for NRTI regimens), so these drugs were received by study participants prior to sequencing."
37071019,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,No.,R263K and G118R coding mutations were combined via site-directed mutagenesis using the previously described G118R primers and pET15b-INB R263K plasmid. Proper mutagenesis was verified by Sanger sequencing.,"All experimental descriptions indicate the authors engineered mutations into plasmids and recombinant proteins (site-directed mutagenesis, plasmid amplification in bacteria) and validated those constructs by Sanger sequencing. There is no description of obtaining or sequencing HIV from patient-derived plasma or cells in the Methods or Results; patient cases are only discussed by citation to other studies. Therefore the paper does not report HIV sequences derived from patient samples."
37071019,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,Yes.,"We performed resistance assays with DTG. However, we also included BIC since this drug may be considered after failure with DTG, given that resistance levels can be lower for BIC than for DTG. For antiretroviral drug susceptibility assays, a similar approach was used with some modifications... 1:10 serial dilutions of DTG (0.16 pM to 1.6 μM) or BIC (0.14 pM to 1.4 μM) were added to the cells in triplicate.","The Results and Methods describe single-cycle infectivity-based drug susceptibility assays in TZM-bl cells using dilutions of dolutegravir (DTG) and bictegravir (BIC) and report fold changes in susceptibility for mutant versus WT viruses. These are in vitro antiviral susceptibility experiments, so the paper does report in vitro drug susceptibility data."
37071019,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No evidence of public deposition (no sequences appear to have been made publicly available).,Proper site-directed mutagenesis was validated by Sanger sequencing. The manuscript does not list any GenBank accession numbers or mention deposition of sequences in public databases.,"While the authors used Sanger sequencing to validate their engineered plasmids, there is no mention in the text of depositing sequence data to GenBank or any other public repository, nor are accession numbers provided. Therefore there is no indication that sequences were made publicly available."
37071019,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,Proper site-directed mutagenesis was validated by Sanger sequencing. The manuscript does not provide any GenBank accession numbers.,"The paper contains no GenBank accession numbers or similar identifiers. The sequencing mentioned was used to verify engineered plasmids, but no GenBank entries are cited; thus no accession numbers are reported."
37071019,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Zero — no individual/patient samples were obtained for sequencing in this study.,"R263K and G118R coding mutations were combined via site-directed mutagenesis using the previously described G118R primers and pET15b-INB R263K plasmid. WT, G118R, R263K, and G118R plus R263K HIV-1 viruses were produced by transfection in 293T cells.","All experimental procedures describe plasmid construction, recombinant protein purification, and virus production from transfected cell lines (293T), with no protocol for collection of patient samples. References to patient cases are citations to other published clinical trials. Therefore no individuals contributed samples for sequencing in this work."
37071019,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable — no patient-derived sequenced samples were obtained.,"R263K and G118R coding mutations were combined via site-directed mutagenesis using the previously described G118R primers and pET15b-INB R263K plasmid. WT, G118R, R263K, and G118R plus R263K HIV-1 viruses were produced by transfection in 293T cells.","Because sequencing in this study was performed on engineered plasmids/constructs and laboratory-produced viruses rather than on samples collected from individuals in specific countries, there are no country sources to report."
37071019,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable — no patient-derived sequenced samples were obtained.,Proper site-directed mutagenesis was validated by Sanger sequencing. The manuscript does not report collection dates for patient samples or any sequencing dates tied to clinical specimens.,"Sequencing described in the paper pertains to validation of engineered plasmids (Sanger sequencing) and is not linked to patient sample collection years. No dates for patient sampling or clinical sequencing are provided, so this question is not applicable."
37071019,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not applicable for patient samples; plasmid constructs were generated and amplified in bacteria prior to Sanger sequencing.,"Plasmids were amplified in XL-10 Gold bacteria (Stratagene), and proper mutagenesis was verified by Sanger sequencing. The pNL4.3-INB G118R+R263K plasmid was derived from the pNL4.3-INB R263K plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis, as described above.","No patient-derived viral samples were cloned and sequenced. The authors did clone and amplify engineered plasmids in bacterial strains (XL-10 Gold) as part of construct preparation and then validated those constructs by Sanger sequencing. Thus cloning occurred for plasmid constructs, not for patient isolates."
37071019,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,The integrase coding region (integrase gene) was the sequenced/validated target in the plasmid constructs.,R263K and G118R coding mutations were combined via site-directed mutagenesis using the previously described G118R primers and pET15b-INB R263K plasmid. Proper site-directed mutagenesis was validated by Sanger sequencing.,"The paper focuses on mutations in the integrase protein (G118R and R263K), and the sequencing described was used to validate the presence of these coding mutations in the plasmid constructs. Therefore the sequenced region was the integrase coding region of the pol gene in the engineered plasmids."
37071019,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Sanger sequencing.,Proper mutagenesis was validated by Sanger sequencing. Proper site-directed mutagenesis was validated by Sanger sequencing.,"The Methods explicitly state that site-directed mutagenesis was validated by Sanger sequencing, indicating Sanger sequencing was the method used to confirm plasmid sequence and introduced mutations."
37071019,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Engineered plasmid DNA (plasmid constructs) was sequenced/validated by Sanger sequencing.,"Plasmids were amplified in XL-10 Gold bacteria (Stratagene), and proper mutagenesis was verified by Sanger sequencing. The pNL4.3-INB G118R+R263K plasmid was derived from the pNL4.3-INB R263K plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis, as described above.","Sequencing is described in the context of validating site-directed mutagenesis of plasmid constructs (pET15b-INB and pNL4.3-INB derivatives). There is no description of sequencing of patient plasma, PBMCs, or viral RNA; thus the sequenced material was plasmid DNA."
37071019,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,No sequences from such individuals were obtained in this study (the paper cites other studies reporting such cases).,"three participants in the DAWNING clinical trial experienced virological failure with G118R plus R263K, and clonal analysis found the two mutations together in single HIV-1 genomes in two cases. R263K and G118R coding mutations were combined via site-directed mutagenesis using the previously described G118R primers and pET15b-INB R263K plasmid.","The manuscript references published clinical cases (e.g., DAWNING) where G118R plus R263K were observed in patients failing therapy, but the experimental work in this paper used engineered plasmids and laboratory-produced viruses. No sequencing of viruses from failing patients was performed in this study."
37071019,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No — this study did not include patients; it is laboratory-based. Clinical trials are only cited in the Discussion.,"The rarity of cases with G118R plus R263K is not merely a consequence of the individual scarcity of G118R and R263K. For example, although they were individually reported for 6 participants, R263K and G118R were not found in combination in the IMPAACT P1093 clinical trial. WT, G118R, R263K, and G118R plus R263K HIV-1 viruses were produced by transfection in 293T cells.","The paper discusses clinical trial findings from other studies to contextualize the mutations, but the experiments described in Methods (plasmid mutagenesis, recombinant protein purification, cell-based assays) do not involve study patients or clinical trial enrollment. Therefore no patients in this study were participants in clinical trials."
37071019,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No — the paper does not report sequences from individuals previously treated with antiretrovirals; patient cases are referenced from other studies.,G118R plus R263K has been reported together in highly treatment-experienced persons who experienced treatment failure with DTG. R263K and G118R coding mutations were combined via site-directed mutagenesis using the previously described G118R primers and pET15b-INB R263K plasmid.,"Although the Discussion mentions that G118R plus R263K were observed in treatment-experienced patients in prior studies, the present work sequenced engineered plasmids and did not present sequences from treated individuals."
37071019,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not applicable — no individuals in this study had samples sequenced. (The experimental work tested integrase strand transfer inhibitor drugs DTG and BIC in vitro.),"DTG and BIC were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada) (D528800 and B382095, respectively). When the combination of G118R plus R263K occurs, the current report and previous publications suggest that none of the other integrase inhibitors may be used.","The study did not sequence patient samples and therefore did not document patient antiretroviral histories. The experiments focus on integrase inhibitors (INSTIs: dolutegravir and bictegravir) in vitro, but that does not equate to patient drug exposure data in this study."
37071019,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not applicable — no individuals in this study had samples sequenced. (The paper experimentally tested dolutegravir and bictegravir and discusses raltegravir and elvitegravir in the Discussion.),"DTG and BIC were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada) (D528800 and B382095, respectively). In addition, neither raltegravir nor elvitegravir should be considered, since G118R alone confers resistance to both drugs.","Because the study did not obtain or sequence samples from individuals, there are no reported patient-level drug exposures prior to sequencing. The manuscript describes laboratory testing of DTG and BIC and discusses other integrase inhibitors (raltegravir, elvitegravir) in context, but these are experimental/interpretive details, not patient treatment histories."
37052343,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,No — the paper does not report HIV sequences from patient samples.,"Our study has limitations. RESPOND does not systematically collect data on HIV subtypes and genotypic resistance analysis, which could affect the choice of initial ART or the virological outcome.","I searched the manuscript for any methods or results describing HIV sequencing, genotyping, or sequence deposition. The paper explicitly states that RESPOND does not systematically collect data on HIV subtypes and genotypic resistance analysis, and there are no methods or results sections describing sequencing procedures or sequence data. Therefore the study did not report HIV sequences from patient samples."
37052343,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No — the paper does not report in vitro drug susceptibility (phenotypic) data.,"Our study has limitations. RESPOND does not systematically collect data on HIV subtypes and genotypic resistance analysis, which could affect the choice of initial ART or the virological outcome.",The manuscript contains no methods or results describing phenotypic susceptibility assays or in vitro drug susceptibility testing. The explicit statement that genotypic resistance data are not systematically collected implies phenotypic/in vitro susceptibility data were not part of the study. Thus no in vitro susceptibility data are reported.
37052343,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No — there were no sequences reported and thus none made publicly available.,"Our study has limitations. RESPOND does not systematically collect data on HIV subtypes and genotypic resistance analysis, which could affect the choice of initial ART or the virological outcome.","Because the study did not collect or report HIV sequence or genotypic resistance data, there are no sequence data to deposit or to have been made publicly available. The paper contains no GenBank accession numbers or statements of sequence deposition."
37052343,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None — no GenBank accession numbers are reported because no HIV sequences were reported.,"Our study has limitations. RESPOND does not systematically collect data on HIV subtypes and genotypic resistance analysis, which could affect the choice of initial ART or the virological outcome.","I searched the text for any GenBank or accession numbers and found none. The manuscript explicitly notes that genotypic data were not systematically collected, so no sequences or accession numbers are provided."
37052343,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,"None for sequencing; the study included 4,310 ART‑naive participants overall.","We included 4310 eligible ART-naive participants (Figure 1). Our study has limitations. RESPOND does not systematically collect data on HIV subtypes and genotypic resistance analysis, which could affect the choice of initial ART or the virological outcome.","The cohort size (4,310 ART‑naive participants) is reported, but the manuscript also states that RESPOND does not systematically collect genotypic sequencing data. Therefore no participants had samples obtained for sequencing as part of this study."
37052343,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable — no sequences were reported; the RESPOND cohort includes sites in Europe and Australia (multiple national cohorts).,"The International Cohort Consortium of Infectious Diseases (RESPOND) is a collaboration among 19 cohorts from Europe and Australia, using the HIV Cohorts Data Exchange Protocol for data collection (details at https://hicdep.org/). Additional support has been provided by participating cohorts contributing in-kind data and/or statistical support: the Austrian HIV Cohort Study, the Australian HIV Observational Database, CHU Saint-Pierre, University Hospital Cologne, EuroSIDA, the Frankfurt HIV Cohort Study, the Georgian National AIDS Health Information System, the Modena HIV Cohort, the San Raffaele Scientific Institute, the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, the AIDS Therapy Evaluation in the Netherlands Cohort (ATHENA), and the Royal Free HIV Cohort Study.","There are no sequenced samples reported, so the question of which countries provided sequenced samples is not applicable. For context, the RESPOND collaboration comprises cohorts across Europe and Australia (listed in the funding/acknowledgement section), which is the geographic source of the study participants."
37052343,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable — no sequences were reported; study ART initiation period was 2014–2020.,"We included treatment-naive participants aged ≥18 who initiated 3-drug ART, in 2014--2020. Our study has limitations. RESPOND does not systematically collect data on HIV subtypes and genotypic resistance analysis, which could affect the choice of initial ART or the virological outcome.","No sequencing was performed, so there are no years for sequenced samples. The relevant study timeframe for participant inclusion (ART initiation) was 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020, which is the period during which clinical samples were collected for the cohort's clinical data."
37052343,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No — not applicable because no sequencing was performed.,"Our study has limitations. RESPOND does not systematically collect data on HIV subtypes and genotypic resistance analysis, which could affect the choice of initial ART or the virological outcome.",There are no methods describing sequencing or cloning procedures in the manuscript. The explicit statement that genotypic data were not systematically collected indicates that sample cloning and sequencing were not performed as part of this study.
37052343,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,None — no HIV genes were sequenced or reported in this study.,"Our study has limitations. RESPOND does not systematically collect data on HIV subtypes and genotypic resistance analysis, which could affect the choice of initial ART or the virological outcome.","The paper contains no methods, results, or tables describing sequencing of HIV genes (e.g., pol, env, gag). The explicit limitation about lack of genotypic data confirms no gene sequencing was reported."
37052343,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not applicable — no sequencing methods were reported because no sequences were generated.,"Our study has limitations. RESPOND does not systematically collect data on HIV subtypes and genotypic resistance analysis, which could affect the choice of initial ART or the virological outcome.","There is no description of laboratory sequencing methods (Sanger, next-generation sequencing, etc.) anywhere in the manuscript. The statement that genotypic data were not systematically collected indicates sequencing was not part of the protocol."
37052343,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Not applicable — no samples were sequenced. The clinical data were based on plasma HIV‑1 RNA measurements (plasma).,Participants had a CD4+ T-cell count measured and a detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA value at ART initiation and a minimum follow-up time of 36 weeks. Baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA levels >100 000 copies/mL and CD4+ T-cell counts ≤200/µL were negatively associated with VS at weeks 48 (adjusted odds ratio...).,"Although the study used plasma HIV‑1 RNA measurements (i.e., plasma samples) for virological outcomes, there is no indication that plasma or any other sample type was sequenced. Therefore no sequenced sample types are reported; plasma is the specimen type used for viral load measurements in the cohort."
37052343,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,No — no sequences were obtained; the study did report virological failure events but did not sequence samples from those individuals.,"VF was defined as the first of 2 consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA measurements ≥50 copies/mL, with 1 measurement ≥200 copies/mL, following VS. Our study has limitations. RESPOND does not systematically collect data on HIV subtypes and genotypic resistance analysis, which could affect the choice of initial ART or the virological outcome.","The manuscript details definitions and incidence of virological failure but explicitly notes genotypic resistance data are not systematically collected and provides no sequencing data from participants with VF. Thus, although VF events occurred, no sequences from those individuals are reported."
37052343,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — participants were from observational cohorts (RESPOND), not a clinical trial.","The International Cohort Consortium of Infectious Diseases (RESPOND) is a collaboration among 19 cohorts from Europe and Australia, using the HIV Cohorts Data Exchange Protocol for data collection (details at https://hicdep.org/ ). Participants consented to share data according to local requirements.","The study population was recruited from multiple observational cohorts contributing data to the RESPOND consortium. The manuscript repeatedly refers to cohort data collection and observational analyses (logistic regression, Cox models), with no mention of a randomized clinical trial context."
37052343,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No — the study focused on ART‑naive individuals and did not report sequences.,"We included treatment-naive participants aged ≥18 who initiated 3-drug ART, in 2014--2020. Our study has limitations. RESPOND does not systematically collect data on HIV subtypes and genotypic resistance analysis, which could affect the choice of initial ART or the virological outcome.","Participants were ART‑naive at enrollment (i.e., had not previously received antiretroviral drugs), and the study did not collect genotypic sequence data. Therefore there are no sequences from previously treated individuals reported."
37052343,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not applicable for 'before sequencing' because no sequencing was performed and participants were ART‑naive; after ART initiation, initial regimens included NRTI backbones plus a third agent from PI, NNRTI, or INSTI classes.","We included treatment-naive participants aged ≥18 who initiated 3-drug ART, in 2014--2020. Models were adjusted for ... initial ART classes. The latter included: a 2--nucleos(t)ide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone (abacavir-lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF]--emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide [TAF]--emtricitabine) plus 1 of the following third agents: cobicistat- or ritonavir-boosted darunavir (protease inhibitor [PI]), rilpivirine (nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]), and cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir, dolutegravir, or raltegravir (INSTI).","No sequencing was performed, and participants were ART‑naive at baseline, so no one had received ARV drugs before sequencing. For completeness, the manuscript describes the classes used as initial ART during the study: NRTI backbones plus a third agent from PI, NNRTI, or INSTI classes."
37052343,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not applicable for 'before sequencing' — participants were ART‑naive; the initial ART drugs used in the study included abacavir-lamivudine, TDF-emtricitabine, TAF-emtricitabine, darunavir (boosted), rilpivirine, elvitegravir (cobicistat‑boosted), dolutegravir, and raltegravir.","Models were adjusted for ... initial ART classes.

The manuscript does, however, list the specific drugs used as initial regimens in the cohort, which are provided above for context."
37085698,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,"This was a cross-sectional study involving isolation of HIV-1 from plasma of 49 newly diagnosed drug-naive HIV-1 infected individuals in Addis-Ababa during the period between June to December 2018. Near full-length HIV-1 IN region, (263 codons) of the 49 study participants were successfully sequenced and analyzed.","The abstract and results explicitly state that HIV-1 was isolated from plasma of 49 newly diagnosed, drug-naive individuals and that the near full-length integrase (263 codons) region from those 49 participants was successfully sequenced and analyzed, demonstrating sequences were obtained from patient samples."
37085698,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,"No — only genotypic/in silico susceptibility interpretation was reported, not in vitro phenotypic assays.","The susceptibility of HIV to ARV drugs was determined using the HIVdb program ( http://hivdb.stanford.edu ). Purified amplicons were then sequenced with Sanger DNA sequencing using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems), and run on the ABI PRISM® 3500 xL automated Genetic Analyzer.","Methods describe PCR and Sanger sequencing and the use of the HIVdb program to determine susceptibility (an in silico genotypic interpretation).

Purified amplicons were then sequenced with Sanger DNA sequencing using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems), and run on the ABI PRISM® 3500 xL automated Genetic Analyzer.","The methods describe nested PCR amplification, gel purification of amplicons and direct Sanger sequencing of purified PCR products. There is no mention of cloning PCR products into vectors prior to sequencing, so samples were not cloned before sequencing."
37085698,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,The HIV-1 integrase (IN) gene region — the first 263 codons of integrase.,"This study aimed to assess INSTI RMs and polymorphisms at the gene locus coding for Integrase (IN) among viral isolates from ART-naive HIV-1 infected Ethiopian population. Near full-length HIV-1 IN region, (263 codons) of the 49 study participants were successfully sequenced and analyzed.","The paper repeatedly refers to sequencing and analysis of the integrase (IN) region covering the first 263 codons; no other HIV genes are described as sequenced, so integrase is the sequenced region."
37085698,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Sanger DNA sequencing using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 kit and an ABI PRISM 3500 xL genetic analyzer.,"Purified amplicons were then sequenced with Sanger DNA sequencing using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems), and run on the ABI PRISM® 3500 xL automated Genetic Analyzer. Sequence edition and alignment were then made using Geneious prime® software v.2020.2.1.","The methods explicitly state the use of Sanger sequencing chemistry (BigDye v3.1) and analysis on an ABI PRISM 3500 xL instrument, indicating conventional capillary Sanger sequencing was used."
37085698,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,"Plasma-derived viral RNA (blood collected in EDTA tubes, plasma separated and viral RNA extracted).","Blood samples (10 ml) were collected at the time of HIV diagnosis before initiation of ART for genotypic assay of the IN gene region from these participants using an EDTA tube. Viral RNA extraction and viral load were performed consecutively from 200 μL of thawed participants' plasma sample input using the Abbott Real-time HIV-1 M2000 system (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, USA).","The methods describe collection of whole blood in EDTA tubes, separation of plasma and extraction of viral RNA from 200 μL of thawed plasma for PCR and sequencing, indicating sequences were generated from plasma-derived viral RNA."
37085698,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,No.,"This is a cross-sectional health facility-based study involving drug-naive HIV-1 infected study participants. This research did not include pregnant women, those with known chronic conditions, or anyone who had ever used ART.","The study specifically enrolled drug-naive individuals who had never used ART and sampled them at diagnosis before ART initiation, so none were on treatment or experiencing virological failure on treatment."
37085698,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No.,This was a cross-sectional health facility-based study involving drug-naive HIV-1 infected study participants. Study participants ... were sequentially enrolled.,"The paper describes a cross-sectional, facility-based observational study with sequential enrollment; there is no indication of a clinical trial protocol or trial registration, so participants were not enrolled in a clinical trial."
37085698,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No.,"This research did not include pregnant women, those with known chronic conditions, or anyone who had ever used ART. This was a cross-sectional study involving isolation of HIV-1 from plasma of 49 newly diagnosed drug-naive HIV-1 infected individuals in Addis-Ababa during the period between June to December 2018.","The study explicitly excluded anyone who had ever used antiretroviral therapy and describes participants as drug-naive, therefore sequences are from ART-naive individuals."
37085698,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,None — participants were ART-naive and had not received any antiretroviral drug classes prior to sampling.,This research did not include ... anyone who had ever used ART. This was a cross-sectional study involving isolation of HIV-1 from plasma of 49 newly diagnosed drug-naive HIV-1 infected individuals in Addis-Ababa during the period between June to December 2018.,"Because the study population was explicitly drug-naive and those with prior ART use were excluded, no participants had received any ARV drug classes before sequencing."
37085698,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,None — no individual had received antiretroviral drugs prior to sampling.,This research did not include ... anyone who had ever used ART. All participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study and that this study was conducted following the declaration of Helsinki.,"The manuscript clearly states prior ART use was an exclusion criterion and participants were drug-naive, so no specific ARV drugs were received by participants before sequencing."
37104815,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes. The paper reports HIV sequences from patient samples generated by Sanger and ultra-deep sequencing of the HIV-1 genome (RNA at failure and DNA at baseline).,"Sanger and ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) were performed on the HIV-1 genome (Illumina technology) according to the ANRS consensus. Resistance was retrospectively evaluated for participants with VF (pVL >50 copies/mL, confirmed within 4 weeks), numbering six and four in the 4/7 and 7/7 days groups, respectively, at failure in RNA samples (on the confirmed test), and at D0 in DNA samples.","The abstract and methods explicitly state that Sanger and UDS were performed on the HIV-1 genome. The virological analyses section specifies that sequencing was applied to plasma RNA at failure and to HIV DNA at baseline (D0), demonstrating that sequences were obtained from patient-derived samples."
37104815,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,"No. The paper reports genotypic resistance (Sanger and UDS) and pharmacological drug concentration measurements, but does not report in vitro phenotypic drug susceptibility assay data.","Sanger and ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) were performed for the reverse transcriptase (RT), protease (PR) and integrase (INT) regions, according to the ANRS-MIE consensus, using Illumina technology. Plasma ARV residual concentrations for the 'ON period' ... were measured using a validated turbulent flow chromatography method ... coupled with triple quadrupole MS detection.","The manuscript describes genotypic analyses (Sanger/UDS) and drug level measurements, and it discusses resistance interpretation via ANRS and Stanford algorithms; however, there is no mention of any in vitro phenotypic susceptibility assays (e.g., phenotypic IC50/IC90 or culture-based phenotyping), so no in vitro susceptibility data were reported."
37104815,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,Not reported. The paper does not provide GenBank accession numbers or state that sequence data were deposited in public repositories.,"Sanger and ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) were performed on the HIV-1 genome (Illumina technology) according to the ANRS consensus. The sequence reads were analysed using IDNSVR software v3_8_0r4 (VCSmartGene), and resistance was interpreted using the latest ANRS resistance algorithm (version 24, http://hivfrenchresistance.org/).","While the methods describe sequencing and subsequent analysis, there is no mention in the manuscript of depositing sequence data to GenBank or other public repositories, nor are accession numbers provided; therefore public availability is not reported."

37104815,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Sequencing was reported both for the substudy cohort (first 121 participants had ultrasensitive analyses) and specifically for resistance sequencing in 10 participants with virological failure (6 in 4/7 arm and 4 in 7/7 arm).,"HIV-1 total DNA, ultra-sensitive plasma viral load (USpVL) and semen VL were measured in the first 121 participants. Resistance was retrospectively evaluated for participants with VF (pVL >50 copies/mL, confirmed within 4 weeks), numbering six and four in the 4/7 and 7/7 days groups, respectively, at failure in RNA samples (on the confirmed test), and at D0 in DNA samples.","The abstract and methods indicate ultrasensitive sequencing analyses were performed in the substudy including the first 121 participants, while the detailed resistance (Sanger and UDS) analyses were applied retrospectively to the 10 participants who experienced virological failure (6 + 4). Therefore sequencing-related assays were applied to both the wider substudy cohort and specifically to the 10 VF cases for resistance assessment."
37104815,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Samples were obtained in France (multicentre French trial); participants included people of diverse origins, with 10% reported as from sub-Saharan Africa.","ANRS 170 QUATUOR was an open-label, randomized, multicentre, non-inferiority Phase III trial ... The study was approved by the French Sud-Ouest OM III ethics committee. Most of the participants were men (84.3%), 69% were MSM, the median (IQR) age was 49 years (40--53) and 10% were from sub-Saharan Africa.",The trial is described as a French multicentre study with French ethics approval and centralized assays at French hospitals; thus samples were collected within the trial sites in France. The demographics note participants' region of origin (10% from sub-Saharan Africa) but do not indicate sequencing performed in other countries.
37104815,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Samples were collected from 2017 through 2019 (participants screened 7 September 2017 to 22 January 2018; W48 analyses included data up to 4 April 2019).,"Participants were screened from 7 September 2017 to 22 January 2018, and the W48 analysis included data collected up to 4 April 2019. Blood plasma samples for ultra-sensitive plasma VL (USpVL) were collected at D0, W4, W12, W24, W36 and W48.",Screening and follow-up windows given in the methods indicate enrollment in late 2017 and early 2018 with follow-up data through April 2019; sequencing for baseline (D0) and W48 or failure samples therefore occurred within that 2017–2019 timeframe.
37104815,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No. The methods describe Sanger sequencing and ultra-deep (Illumina) sequencing without mention of cloning of samples prior to sequencing.,"Sanger and ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) were performed for the reverse transcriptase (RT), protease (PR) and integrase (INT) regions, according to the ANRS-MIE consensus, using Illumina technology (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).

37104815,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma RNA samples at failure and cellular HIV total DNA samples at baseline (D0) were sequenced; the study also measured plasma and seminal viral loads but sequencing is reported for RNA and DNA samples.,"Resistance was retrospectively evaluated for participants with VF (pVL >50 copies/mL, confirmed within 4 weeks), numbering six and four ... at failure in RNA samples (on the confirmed test), and at D0 in DNA samples. HIV-1 total DNA, ultra-sensitive plasma viral load (USpVL) and semen VL were measured in the first 121 participants.","The virological analyses specify that resistance sequencing was performed on plasma RNA obtained at confirmed failure and on HIV total DNA at baseline, indicating both nucleic acid types were sequenced; while semen VL was measured, sequencing is not described specifically for semen."
37104815,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Yes. Resistance sequencing (RNA at failure) was performed for the 10 participants who experienced virological failure (6 in the 4/7 arm and 4 in the 7/7 arm).,"Resistance was retrospectively evaluated for participants with VF (pVL >50 copies/mL, confirmed within 4 weeks), numbering six and four in the 4/7 and 7/7 days groups, respectively, at failure in RNA samples (on the confirmed test), and at D0 in DNA samples.

Participants were enrolled in the ANRS 170 QUATUOR open-label, randomized, multicentre, non-inferiority Phase III clinical trial (registered NCT03256422).","ANRS 170 QUATUOR was an open-label, randomized, multicentre, non-inferiority Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of a maintenance 4D/week therapy (4/7 days) versus daily intake (7/7 days) in those who are virally suppressed for 48 weeks. The study was approved by the French Sud-Ouest OM III ethics committee. The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03256422) and EudraCT (2017-000040-17).","The manuscript identifies the work as part of a registered Phase III randomized clinical trial, confirming that patients were participants in a formal clinical trial."
37104815,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"Yes. All participants were on continuous combination ART with sustained virological suppression (>12 months) at enrollment, and sequencing was performed on their RNA/DNA samples.","Adults with plasma VL <50 copies/mL for >12 months and no resistance mutations to current ART (cART) were randomly assigned (1:1), with stratification by third agent class. The cART regimens were based on INSTIs for 47.1%, NNRTIs for 47.1% and PIs for 5.8% of participants. The baseline NRTI backbone consisted of tenofovir/emtricitabine or tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine for 76.0% of participants and abacavir/lamivudine for 24.0%.","Participants were long-term treated and virologically suppressed on combination ART at baseline, so any sequences generated derive from individuals with prior and ongoing ARV exposure."

The manuscript does not provide GenBank accession numbers or state that sequence data were deposited in a public repository.,Full details of the methodology of genotypic and phenotypic analyses have been published (Supplementary page 1). No GenBank accession numbers or statements of public sequence deposition appear in the main text or results.,The article references supplementary materials and previously published methodological reports but does not include any explicit statement or listing of public sequence deposition or accession numbers in the provided text; thus public availability is not reported here.
37340869,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,Not reported. No GenBank accession numbers are provided in the manuscript text.,Full details of the methodology of genotypic and phenotypic analyses have been published (Supplementary page 1). The manuscript does not list any GenBank accession numbers in the main text or results.,A search of the provided manuscript text finds no GenBank accession identifiers or a data availability statement listing accession numbers; therefore accession numbers are not reported in this paper.
37340869,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,"Not explicitly reported. The manuscript gives counts of participants included in analytic datasets (e.g., 1651 total participants; BFAs included 1363 and 1431 participants with complete records) but does not explicitly state the number of individuals from whom sequences were obtained.","Across 3 studies, 1651 unique participants were included, 23/1651 (1.4%) of whom had CVF. The BFAs included 1363 and 1431 unique participants with complete records in the single-regimen and all-regimens models, respectively.","While participant counts for analysis cohorts and complete-record subsets are provided, the paper does not explicitly state how many individuals had sequence data generated. References to retrospective proviral DNA analyses and genotypic results imply sequencing on subsets, but an explicit count of individuals with sequence results is not given in the main text."
37340869,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Not fully reported. The manuscript reports regional analyses and notes that 11 participants with CVF were from Russia, but it does not provide a complete list of countries from which sequenced samples were obtained in the main text.","Results were further evaluated by geographical region (North America, Europe, and ""other"" regions) and by country. Overall, 11 participants with CVF were from Russia, all of whom had HIV-1 subtype A6/A1 (Supplementary Table 7 A).","The paper indicates multi-regional enrollment and provides some country-level outcomes for CVF (notably Russia), but it does not enumerate all countries contributing sequence data in the supplied text. Detailed country-level sequencing origins appear to be in supplementary tables, not the main text."
37340869,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not reported. The manuscript provides follow-up cutoffs (weeks of study) but does not provide calendar years for sample collection or sequencing in the main text.,"Data cutoffs were through week 124 for FLAIR, week 96 for ATLAS, and week 152 for ATLAS-2M. Full details of the methodology of genotypic and phenotypic analyses have been published (Supplementary page 1).",The article specifies study follow-up timepoints and week-based cutoffs but does not state calendar years when samples were collected or sequenced; such temporal details are not present in the provided text.
37340869,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not reported. The main text does not describe cloning of samples prior to sequencing.,Full details of the methodology of genotypic and phenotypic analyses have been published (Supplementary page 1). The manuscript discusses retrospective proviral DNA analysis and genotypic results but does not describe cloning steps in the main text.,"No mention of cloning (e.g., single-genome amplification or cloning prior to sequencing) appears in the provided text; methodological specifics are deferred to supplementary/previous publications, so cloning is not reported here."
37340869,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"The paper reports sequence-based findings implicating integrase (L74I) and NNRTI-associated regions (RPV RAMs), indicating sequencing/analysis of the integrase and reverse transcriptase/RT-associated (pol) regions.","Three baseline factors were retained and significantly associated with increased risk of CVF in both models: RPV RAMs, HIV-1 subtype A6/A1, and higher BMI. In the all-regimens MVA model, RPV RAMs, integrase L74I, and model-predicted CAB trough concentration 4 weeks after initial injection were statistically associated with increased risk of CVF.","The text explicitly names an integrase polymorphism (L74I) and resistance-associated mutations to rilpivirine (an NNRTI), which derive from sequencing/analysis of integrase and RT/pol regions. While the manuscript does not present a methods list of genes sequenced, the reported mutation names identify the genes analyzed."
37340869,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not reported in the main text. Sequencing methodology is referred to as described in the Supplementary materials/previous publications but specific sequencing method details are not provided in the manuscript body.,Full details of the methodology of genotypic and phenotypic analyses have been published (Supplementary page 1). The main text refers to retrospective proviral DNA analysis but does not describe the sequencing platform or protocol.,The manuscript defers methodological specifics (including sequencing methods) to supplementary materials and prior publications; therefore the exact sequencing approach is not described in the provided text.
37340869,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Proviral DNA (retrospective proviral DNA analysis) is explicitly mentioned; historical plasma genotypic evidence is also referenced but archived resistance testing was not prospectively performed.,"Notably, RPV RAMs for ATLAS and ATLAS-2M participants were identified by a retrospective proviral DNA analysis. Historical genotypic evidence of any major INSTI or NNRTI RAMs... was exclusionary per the 2015 (FLAIR and ATLAS) and 2019 (ATLAS-2M) IAS-USA guidelines.",The paper explicitly states that RPV resistance-associated mutations in some participants were identified via retrospective proviral DNA analysis; it also refers to historical plasma-based genotypic evidence in eligibility screening. Thus both proviral DNA (used for retrospective resistance calling) and historical plasma genotypes are implicated.
37340869,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"Yes. Some sequence-derived findings relate to participants who experienced confirmed virologic failure (CVF); 23 participants had CVF and the analyses relate baseline sequence findings (e.g., preexisting RPV RAMs) to later CVF.","Across 3 studies, 1651 unique participants were included, 23/1651 (1.4%) of whom had CVF. The BFAs and MVAs identified preexisting RPV RAMs and subtype A6/A1 as baseline predictors associated with increased risk of CVF.","Although baseline sequencing was obtained while most participants were virologically suppressed, a subset of participants went on to experience CVF and the manuscript links baseline sequence-derived RAMs/subtype to later virologic failure, indicating that sequences are available/used in relation to individuals who had virologic failure on study treatment."
37340869,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"Yes. Participants were enrolled in randomized, multicenter, open-label phase 3/3b clinical trials (FLAIR, ATLAS, and ATLAS-2M).","Pooled data from 1651 participants were used ... Data from participants who received CAB + RPV LA dosed Q4W and/or Q8W in FLAIR, ATLAS, or ATLAS-2M were pooled in post hoc analyses. FLAIR, ATLAS, and ATLAS-2M are randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, open-label, phase 3/3b studies.","The Methods section explicitly identifies the three named randomized phase 3/3b clinical trials as the source of participant data, confirming that the participants were enrolled in clinical trials."
37340869,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes. Participants were virologically suppressed on antiretroviral therapy at randomization and had prior ARV exposure; the paper discusses historical genotypic evidence and retrospective proviral DNA analyses to detect archived resistance related to prior ARV use.,Participants were ≥18 years of age and virologically suppressed (plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) at randomization. RPV RAMs for ATLAS and ATLAS-2M participants were identified by a retrospective proviral DNA analysis and historical genotypic evidence of major INSTI or NNRTI RAMs was exclusionary.,"Because participants were virologically suppressed on prior therapy and the study refers to historical genotypes and archived resistance (proviral DNA), the sequence data include individuals with prior ARV exposure and prior treatment histories are considered in interpreting resistance."
37340869,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,The manuscript explicitly references INSTI (integrase strand transfer inhibitor) and NNRTI (non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor) classes in eligibility and resistance analyses; participants were on prior daily oral antiretroviral regimens (which could include these classes).,"Historical genotypic evidence of any major INSTI or NNRTI RAMs... was exclusionary per the 2015 (FLAIR and ATLAS) and 2019 (ATLAS-2M) IAS-USA guidelines. The analyses examined CAB RAMs, other INSTI (non-CAB-specific) RAMs, RPV RAMs, and other (non-RPV-specific) NNRTI RAMs as covariates.","The text discusses INSTI- and NNRTI-associated resistance and eligibility criteria based on prior INSTI/NNRTI RAMs, indicating that these drug classes were relevant to participants' prior treatment; other classes are not specifically enumerated in the main text."
37340869,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not specifically reported. The manuscript indicates participants continued daily oral therapy before randomization or switched from oral therapy to CAB + RPV LA, but it does not list specific prior antiretroviral drugs for participants in the provided text.","FLAIR and ATLAS evaluated CAB + RPV LA dosed Q4W versus continuing daily oral therapy and ATLAS-2M evaluated CAB + RPV LA dosed Q8W versus Q4W. Historical genotypic evidence of any major INSTI or NNRTI RAMs, excluding K103N in plasma, was exclusionary per guidelines.","While the study design involved participants on prior daily oral antiretroviral regimens and discusses drug classes and resistance, the main text does not enumerate specific prior drugs (e.g., dolutegravir, efavirenz, etc.); such drug-level details are not provided in the supplied manuscript text."
37327289,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes,"In this study, we analyzed PDR and associated risk factors in recently diagnosed and treatment-naive FSWs in Nairobi, Kenya. To identify HIVDRM, the pol gene was amplified and genotyped using sanger sequencing.","The paper states that plasma samples from study participants were used and that the pol gene was amplified and genotyped by Sanger sequencing to identify HIV drug resistance mutations, which indicates that HIV sequences were generated from patient samples."
37327289,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No,"The Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database genotyping algorithm was used to identify drug resistance mutations from sequencing files that were automatically interpreted by RECall. In this study, we examined mutations conferring resistance to NRTI, NNRTI, and PI, but not mutations that confer INSTI resistance.","The methods and results describe genotypic sequencing and interpretation of resistance-associated mutations using bioinformatic/algorithmic tools; there is no mention of phenotypic or in vitro drug susceptibility assays (e.g., culture-based phenotyping or IC50 measurements). Therefore no in vitro susceptibility data were reported."
37327289,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,Yes,The pol sequences have been archived in the DDBJ Nucleotide Database [LC723952-LC724015].,"The manuscript explicitly states the pol sequences were deposited in the DDBJ Nucleotide Database with accession numbers, indicating public availability."
37327289,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,LC723952-LC724015,The pol sequences have been archived in the DDBJ Nucleotide Database [LC723952-LC724015].,The paper provides the deposited accession range (LC723952-LC724015) for the pol sequences in the DDBJ database; these are the INSDC accession numbers associated with the sequences.
37327289,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,64 individuals had samples sequenced (64 sequences analyzed).,"In this cross-sectional study, we used 64 HIV-seropositive plasma samples collected from FSWs between November 2020 and April 2021. This was a cross-sectional study that utilized 157 plasma samples obtained from HIV-1 seropositive and treatment-naïve FSWs between November 2020 and April 2021.","Although 157 plasma samples were obtained overall, the study repeatedly states that 64 HIV-seropositive plasma samples were used for the HIV drug resistance analysis and the results describe 64 study participants, indicating 64 individuals were sequenced/analyzed."
37327289,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Kenya,"In this study, we analyzed PDR and associated risk factors in recently diagnosed and treatment-naive FSWs in Nairobi, Kenya. The participants were recruited from 7 sex worker outreach program (SWOP) clinics in Nairobi County, specifically Nairobi City, Donholm, Kawangware, Korogocho, Langata, Majengo, and Thika Road.","The recruitment locations are all in Nairobi County, Kenya, so the sequenced samples originated from Kenyan participants."
37327289,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Samples were obtained between November 2020 and April 2021.,"In this cross-sectional study, we used 64 HIV-seropositive plasma samples collected from FSWs between November 2020 and April 2021. This was a cross-sectional study that utilized 157 plasma samples obtained from HIV-1 seropositive and treatment-naïve FSWs between November 2020 and April 2021.","The methods explicitly state the enrollment and sample collection period as November 2020 to April 2021, which defines the timeframe for the sequenced samples."
37327289,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No,"For nested PCR, 2 μL of PCR products were amplified in a 50 μL reaction with AmpliTaq Gold LD DNA polymerase (Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc., Massachusetts, USA) ... The amplified PCR fragment was purified using ExoSAP-IT PCR Product Clean-up Reagent. Thermo Fisher Scientific HIV Genotyping kit was used for the pol gene sequencing, and includes 6 overlapping primers.","The methods describe RT-PCR, nested PCR, PCR product cleanup (ExoSAP-IT) and direct Sanger sequencing using a genotyping kit and overlapping primers, with no mention of cloning PCR products into vectors prior to sequencing. This indicates direct PCR-product (population) sequencing rather than cloning."
37327289,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,pol gene (primary) and the env V3 region (for tropism determination) in many samples.,"To identify HIVDRM, the pol gene was amplified and genotyped using sanger sequencing. HIV-1 tropism was determined using third hypervariable region in the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 (V3) loop sequences as described by Abisi and colleagues.","The paper reports amplification and Sanger sequencing of the pol gene to detect drug resistance mutations, and separately reports sequencing/analysis of the V3 loop within env for tropism determination (with tropism data available for 58/64 subjects and 6 imputed)."
37327289,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Sanger sequencing (Thermo Fisher HIV Genotyping kit on an Applied Biosystems 3500xL DX analyzer with BigDye chemistry).,"Thermo Fisher Scientific HIV Genotyping kit was used for the pol gene sequencing, and includes 6 overlapping primers. The sequencing conditions ... were carried out on an Applied Biosystems 3500xL DX genetic analyzer using the BigDye XTerminator kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA).","The methods section explicitly describes use of a commercial HIV genotyping kit and Sanger sequencing on an Applied Biosystems capillary sequencer with BigDye chemistry, indicating Sanger sequencing was the sequencing method."
37327289,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma samples (viral RNA extracted from plasma).,"In this study, we used 64 HIV-seropositive plasma samples collected from FSWs between November 2020 and April 2021. HIV-1 RNA extraction from plasma samples was carried out using the Invitrogen PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as per manufacturer instructions.","The study describes extraction of HIV-1 RNA from plasma and subsequent RT-PCR and sequencing, indicating that plasma-derived viral RNA was the source material for sequencing."
37327289,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,No,The study comprised subjects who satisfied the following criteria: 18 years old; HIV-1 seropositive; treatment naive; located in Nairobi county during the enrollment period. Among the exclusion criteria were: treatment experienced subjects;,"Participants were treatment-naive and treatment-experienced subjects were excluded, so none of the sequences came from individuals known to be on treatment and failing therapy."
37327289,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No,This was a cross-sectional study that utilized 157 plasma samples obtained from HIV-1 seropositive and treatment-naïve FSWs between November 2020 and April 2021. The participants were recruited from 7 sex worker outreach program (SWOP) clinics in Nairobi County...,"The study is described as a cross-sectional observational study with clinic-based recruitment, not as a randomized clinical trial or interventional study; therefore participants were not enrolled in a clinical trial as part of this report."
37327289,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"No (all participants were treatment-naive), although one sequence showed a pattern suggesting possible prior ARV exposure.","The study comprised subjects who satisfied the following criteria: ... treatment naive; ... Among the exclusion criteria were: treatment experienced subjects; A 1-of-a-kind case involved a subject who had drug resistance mutations across 3 classes, implying a case of acquired HIV drug resistance through previous ARV drug exposure.","Enrollment criteria excluded treatment-experienced individuals, so the sequences are from treatment-naive participants. The authors note one subject's mutation profile (triple-class resistance) that could imply prior ARV exposure, but the subjects themselves were classified as treatment-naive."
37327289,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,None — participants were treatment-naive (no ARV classes received prior to sequencing).,The study comprised subjects who satisfied the following criteria: 18 years old; HIV-1 seropositive; treatment naive; located in Nairobi county during the enrollment period. Among the exclusion criteria were: treatment experienced subjects;,"Because the inclusion criteria required participants to be treatment-naive and treatment-experienced subjects were excluded, individuals had not received antiretroviral drug classes prior to sample collection/sequencing. (Note: the paper reports genotypic resistance mutations conferring resistance to NRTI, NNRTI and PI classes, but those reflect viral mutations rather than documented prior ARV exposure for the participants.)"
37327289,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,None — participants were treatment-naive and had not received antiretroviral drugs before sequencing.,"The study comprised subjects who satisfied the following criteria: ... treatment naive; ... Among the exclusion criteria were: treatment experienced subjects; The K103N mutation, which conferred resistance to NNRTIs such as nevirapine and efavirenz, was a leading cause of PDR, while CD4+ T cell counts and age were significant predictors of HIVDRM counts.","Enrollment required treatment-naive status, so participants did not receive ARV drugs prior to sample collection. Although the authors describe mutations that confer resistance to specific drugs (e.g., K103N → nevirapine/efavirenz; M184V → 3TC/ABC), those are genotypic resistance findings and do not indicate the participants had received those drugs."
37376649,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes. The paper reports proviral DNA genotyping (NGS) performed on baseline whole blood samples from participants.,"Retrospective proviral DNA genotypes were performed for 734 participants (post-hoc analysis) to assess the impact of archived, pre-existing drug resistance on 144-week virologic outcomes by last on-treatment viral load (VL) and Snapshot. HIV-1 proviral DNA genotyping was conducted retrospectively with the GenoSure Archive assay (Monogram Biosciences, South San Francisco, CA, USA), which uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze the HIV-1 polymerase region; a bioinformatic filter is used to remove APOBEC3G/3F-induced G to A hypermutations. Participants' baseline whole blood samples were used for the GenoSure Archive assay.","The methods explicitly describe that retrospective proviral DNA genotypes were performed using the GenoSure Archive NGS assay on participants' baseline whole blood samples and that genotyping was done on the HIV-1 polymerase region. The reported numbers (e.g., 734 participants tested) confirm that sequencing/genotyping of patient samples was performed."
37376649,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No. The paper does not report any in vitro phenotypic drug susceptibility assays; it reports proviral DNA genotypic resistance (NGS) data only.,"Retrospective proviral DNA genotypes were performed for 734 participants (post-hoc analysis) to assess the impact of archived, pre-existing drug resistance on 144-week virologic outcomes by last on-treatment viral load (VL) and Snapshot.

There is no description of in vitro phenotypic susceptibility testing (e.g., phenotypic assays, IC50/ fold-change data) in the methods or results, so only genotypic (sequence-based) resistance data were reported."
37376649,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No. The paper does not report deposition of sequences in public repositories or provide GenBank accession numbers; data availability refers to requesting anonymized participant data through a data request portal.,"Anonymized individual participant data and study documents can be requested for further research from www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com . Retrospective proviral DNA genotypes were performed for 734 participants (post-hoc analysis) to assess the impact of archived, pre-existing drug resistance on 144-week virologic outcomes by last on-treatment viral load (VL) and Snapshot.","The Data Availability Statement indicates anonymized participant data can be requested via a portal but does not state that sequence reads or consensus sequences were deposited in GenBank or other public sequence repositories. No GenBank accession numbers or repository deposition statements appear in the manuscript, indicating sequences were not publicly deposited (or at least not reported here)."

37376649,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,"Retrospective proviral DNA testing was performed on baseline samples from 734 participants; genotypic results were reported for 330 and 324 participants in the two treatment groups (total 654), with 80 assay failures.","Retrospective proviral DNA testing was performed on available baseline samples for 734/741 (99%) participants from the exposed population, with 330/366 (90%) in the DTG/3TC group and 324/368 (88%) in the TBR group having genotypic results reported. The GenoSure Archive assay failed to provide a result for 80 of the 734 (11%) samples tested.","The methods state that baseline samples from 734 participants were tested by the GenoSure Archive assay, giving the count of samples obtained for sequencing. The results further state how many of those yielded genotypic results (330 and 324) and that 80 assays failed, which supports the numbers reported."

37376649,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No evidence of cloning is reported; sequencing was performed by the GenoSure Archive NGS assay on proviral DNA from whole blood without mention of cloning.,"HIV-1 proviral DNA genotyping was conducted retrospectively with the GenoSure Archive assay (Monogram Biosciences, South San Francisco, CA, USA), which uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze the HIV-1 polymerase region; a bioinformatic filter is used to remove APOBEC3G/3F-induced G to A hypermutations. Participants' baseline whole blood samples were used for the GenoSure Archive assay.","The methods describe direct proviral DNA genotyping by an NGS assay and do not mention any cloning or molecular cloning steps prior to sequencing. Because the assay and workflow are described as NGS on proviral DNA from whole blood and no cloning is described, there is no indication that samples were cloned before sequencing."

37376649,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No. Participants with recent virologic failure or a prior regimen switch for virologic failure were excluded, and baseline samples came from virologically suppressed participants.","Participants were excluded if they had any evidence of IAS-USA major NRTI or INSTI RAMs in any historical genotype assay results, if available; any plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement of ≥50 copies/mL within 6 months of screening; a total of ≥2 measurements of ≥50 copies/mL or any measurement of >200 copies/mL within 6 and 12 months of screening; or a prior regimen switch for virologic failure (HIV-1 RNA ≥400 copies/mL). Retrospective proviral DNA testing was performed on available baseline samples for 734/741 (99%) participants from the exposed population.","The study's exclusion criteria disallowed recent plasma viremia and prior regimen switches for virologic failure, and baseline samples were taken from participants meeting these criteria (i.e., virologically suppressed). Therefore sequences were not obtained from individuals actively in virologic failure per the study population."
37376649,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,Yes. The data come from the randomized TANGO clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03446573).,"The TANGO study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03446573 ) demonstrated that switching to dolutegravir/lamivudine (DTG/3TC) was non-inferior to continuing tenofovir alafenamide-based regimens (TBR) through week 144.

Of 919 participants screened for the study, 543 (59%) participants had historical genotypic reports available and submitted for eligibility.","The manuscript reports analysis of resistance across the four major antiretroviral classes (NRTI, NNRTI, PI, INSTI) and describes baseline third-agent classes and historical genotypes, indicating participants had prior exposure to drugs from these classes."
37376649,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,The study participants were on or switching from regimens including dolutegravir/lamivudine (DTG/3TC) or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)-based regimens; specific other individual drugs are not comprehensively listed in the provided manuscript content.,"The TANGO study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03446573 ) demonstrated that switching to dolutegravir/lamivudine (DTG/3TC) was non-inferior to continuing tenofovir alafenamide-based regimens (TBR) through week 144. Baseline characteristics (e.g., age, sex, HIV-1 subtype, baseline third agent class, median CD4+ cell count) were similar between participants with or without M184V/I (Table S1 ).","The paper specifies the study arms (DTG/3TC versus TAF-based regimens), so at minimum participants had exposure to dolutegravir, lamivudine, and tenofovir alafenamide. Beyond these regimen descriptors, the provided text does not give a full list of every individual drug received by participants prior to sequencing, so specific additional drugs are not reported in the content supplied."
37272233,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,"Results of HIV drug resistance mutation sequencing by PCR (AB 3500xL Dx genetic analyzer, Applied biosystem, Waltham, MA, USA) for each ARV class (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NRTI], non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI], protease inhibitor [PI], and integrase strand transfer inhibitor [INSTI]) were reviewed. The first test results from each patient were collected, and data on gene mutation and actual resistance to each medication were collected and analyzed based on the HIV drug resistance database of Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.","The Methods explicitly state that HIV drug resistance mutation sequencing was performed by PCR on patient samples and that the first test results from each patient were collected and analyzed for gene mutations. That indicates sequencing was performed on clinical patient samples and those sequencing results (mutations) are reported in the paper (Supplementary Table 1). Since sequencing of patient-derived virus is described, the correct answer is Yes that the paper reports HIV sequences (genotypic/resistance sequence data) from patient samples. Note: the paper reports mutation/sequence-based resistance data rather than providing raw sequence files."
37272233,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No.,"Results of HIV drug resistance mutation sequencing by PCR (AB 3500xL Dx genetic analyzer...) for each ARV class ... were reviewed, and data on gene mutation and actual resistance to each medication were collected and analyzed based on the HIV drug resistance database of Stanford University. The paper describes resistance detected by genotypic mutations and interpretation using the Stanford HIV drug resistance database; no phenotypic or in vitro susceptibility assays are mentioned.","All described resistance data are derived from genotypic sequencing and interpretation via the Stanford database. There is no mention of phenotypic assays, culture-based susceptibility testing, or in vitro phenotypic drug susceptibility measurements in Methods or Results. Therefore the study did not report in vitro drug susceptibility data."
37272233,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No (no public deposition reported).,"Results of HIV drug resistance mutation sequencing by PCR (AB 3500xL Dx genetic analyzer...) for each ARV class ... were reviewed, and data on gene mutation and actual resistance to each medication were collected and analyzed based on the HIV drug resistance database of Stanford University. Details of the resistance mutations, classes and ARVs of resistance, and effects of treatment on individual patients are described in Supplementary Table 1.","The paper describes genotypic sequencing and presents mutation data (in Supplementary Table 1), but there is no statement about depositing sequences in public repositories (for example, GenBank accession numbers) and no accession numbers are provided anywhere in the text. Because no deposition or accession numbers are reported, sequences were not made publicly available as part of this paper."
37272233,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,"Details of the resistance mutations, classes and ARVs of resistance, and effects of treatment on individual patients are described in Supplementary Table 1. The manuscript does not include any GenBank accession numbers or mention deposition of sequences in public databases.","I searched the Methods, Results, and Supplementary references and found mutation data reported in the supplement but no GenBank accession numbers or statements of sequence deposition. Therefore no GenBank accession numbers are reported in the paper."
37272233,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,248 individuals.,"A total of 336 patients were screened, and 248 were included in the analysis. Results of HIV drug resistance mutation sequencing by PCR (...) for each ARV class (...) were reviewed, and data on gene mutation and actual resistance to each medication were collected and analyzed.",The paper states 336 screened and 248 included in analysis; the Methods indicate the authors reviewed the resistance mutation sequencing results and collected the first test results from each patient. Patients excluded included those with no resistance mutation results. Thus the dataset used for sequencing/analysis comprised 248 individuals.
37272233,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Republic of Korea (Korea).,"Resistance Trends of Antiretroviral Agents in People with Human Immunodeficiency Virus in Korea, 2012 - 2020. This study was performed at a 750-bed municipal hospital ... most patients lived in Seoul or Gyeonggi-do.",The title and multiple places in the manuscript identify the study population as people with HIV in Korea and note that most patients lived in Seoul or Gyeonggi-do. Therefore all sequenced samples derive from patients in Korea.
37272233,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Patients diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2020 (sequencing/results analyzed within that period); INSTI resistance testing began May 30, 2018.","All adults aged ≥19 years who were newly diagnosed with HIV infection between January 2010 and December 2020 at a 750-bed municipal hospital ... were included. Because resistance tests for INSTI began only after May 30, 2018, at the research center, resistance data for this class were restricted.","The study cohort covers diagnoses from 2010 through 2020 and the resistance sequencing results used in analyses come from tests performed during that timeframe. The paper also notes that INSTI resistance testing only started on May 30, 2018, so INSTI sequence data are only available from that later period."
37272233,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No evidence of cloning; cloning is not reported.,"Results of HIV drug resistance mutation sequencing by PCR (AB 3500xL Dx genetic analyzer, Applied biosystem...) for each ARV class (...) were reviewed. The Methods describe sequencing by PCR on an ABI 3500xL analyzer and do not mention subcloning or cloning prior to sequencing.","The Methods explicitly describe PCR-based sequencing on an ABI 3500xL instrument (a Sanger platform) but do not describe any cloning or plasmid subcloning steps prior to sequencing. In the absence of any mention of cloning, the correct interpretation is that samples were not cloned prior to sequencing (direct PCR/Sanger sequencing was performed)."
37272233,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Regions corresponding to genes targeted by ARV classes: reverse transcriptase (for NRTI and NNRTI), protease (for PI), and integrase (for INSTI).","Results of HIV drug resistance mutation sequencing by PCR (...) for each ARV class (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NRTI], non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI], protease inhibitor [PI], and integrase strand transfer inhibitor [INSTI]) were reviewed. Resistance mutations were organized by year and ARV classes. In addition, the gene mutations detected throughout the entire study period were analyzed.","The paper states sequencing was performed for each ARV class (NRTI, NNRTI, PI, INSTI). Those ARV classes correspond to mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene (NRTI/NNRTI), protease (PR) gene (PI), and integrase (IN) gene (INSTI). The manuscript does not list additional gene regions, so the sequenced regions are those encoding protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase."
37272233,10,What method was used for sequencing?,"PCR-based sequencing using an ABI 3500xL Dx genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems) — i.e., Sanger sequencing of PCR products.","Results of HIV drug resistance mutation sequencing by PCR (AB 3500xL Dx genetic analyzer, Applied biosystem, Waltham, MA, USA) for each ARV class (...) were reviewed. The first test results from each patient were collected, and data on gene mutation ... were collected and analyzed based on the HIV drug resistance database of Stanford University.","The Methods explicitly name PCR-based sequencing using the AB 3500xL Dx genetic analyzer, which is a Sanger capillary sequencer. Therefore sequencing was performed by PCR amplification of target regions followed by Sanger sequencing on the ABI 3500xL platform."
37272233,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,"Not explicitly stated; sequencing was performed on patient-derived clinical specimens (implied viral RNA from patient samples), but the manuscript does not specify the biological specimen type (e.g., plasma).","The initial state of an HIV-infected person was evaluated using ... HIV-specific laboratory data including CD4+ T cell count and HIV RNA quantification by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results of HIV drug resistance mutation sequencing by PCR (...) for each ARV class (...) were reviewed. The paper does not specify the specimen type (plasma, PBMC, etc.) used for sequencing.","While the paper describes HIV RNA quantification and PCR-based resistance sequencing, it does not explicitly state whether sequencing was performed on plasma viral RNA, PBMC-derived DNA, or another specimen. Given standard practice, sequencing is typically done on plasma-derived viral RNA, but because the authors did not explicitly state the specimen type, the answer must reflect that it is not specified in the manuscript."
37272233,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"Not explicitly reported as sequences from virological failure cases; however, some detected mutations (e.g., T215 revertants) are related to virological failure and some patients had prior ART exposure shortly before testing.","ART was administered to 6 patients within 12 days before testing for ARV-resistance mutations, and ART resistance was not detected in them. T215 revertants related to virological failure to ZDV or d4T were found in three patients, and a patient with T215 revertants had T215D and K103N mutations simultaneously.","The manuscript does not explicitly state that sequences were derived from patients known to have virological failure while on therapy. It does note some patients had recent ART exposure and that certain mutations (T215 revertants) are associated with virological failure in the literature; however, the paper does not present a clear subset labeled as 'virological failure on treatment' with corresponding sequences. Therefore the answer is that this was not explicitly reported, though some mutations associated with failure were observed."
37272233,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No.,"Adults aged ≥19 years and diagnosed with HIV infection between January 2010 and December 2020 at a 750-bed municipal hospital were retrospectively reviewed. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Boramae Medical Center (No. 20-2021-80), and the need for informed consent was waived because of the retrospective nature of the study.","The study is described as a retrospective review of medical records at a single hospital, with IRB approval and waiver of consent; there is no indication that patients were enrolled in a clinical trial. Thus patients were not part of a clinical trial."
37272233,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes — some individuals had prior ART exposure before sequencing.,"Previous history of ART has been increased without statistical significance (1/59 [1.7%] in 2012 - 2014, 1/104 [1.0%] in 2015 - 2017, and 4/85 [4.7%] in 2018 - 2020, P = 0.281). Fifteen patients underwent ART before the resistance results were reported and there was no change in the ART regimen after resistance mutations were found.",The manuscript reports that a subset of patients had previous ART exposure and that some patients started ART prior to resistance result reporting. Therefore sequences (resistance data) include individuals who had previously received antiretroviral drugs.
37272233,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not specified in detail by drug class prior to sequencing.,Previous history of ART has been increased without statistical significance (...) and Fifteen patients underwent ART before the resistance results were reported and there was no change in the ART regimen after resistance mutations were found. All 28 patients had been prescribed a single pill regimen since 2015.,"The paper documents prior ART exposure in some patients and notes use of single-tablet regimens since 2015, but it does not enumerate which ARV drug classes or specific regimens those prior-treated patients were receiving at the time of sequencing. Although the study discusses resistance by class (NRTI, NNRTI, PI, INSTI), it does not report the prior treatment classes for the individuals whose samples were sequenced."
37272233,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not reported (specific drugs or regimens prior to sequencing are not detailed).,"Fifteen patients underwent ART before the resistance results were reported and there was no change in the ART regimen after resistance mutations were found. All 28 patients had been prescribed a single pill regimen since 2015. The paper discusses detected resistance to various drugs (e.g., didanosine, abacavir, zidovudine, stavudine, delavirdine, nevirapine, efavirenz, nelfinavir, elvitegravir, raltegravir) but does not state which drugs individual patients had received prior to sequencing.","Although the manuscript lists drugs to which resistance was detected and discusses general prescribing patterns (single-pill regimens), it does not provide a patient-level listing of prior ARV drugs or specify which drugs the pre-treated individuals actually received. Therefore specific prior drugs are not reported."
37495103,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,"The study cohort (n = 271) included HIV-infected individuals who visited the Novosibirsk, Russia, HIV/AIDS clinic in 2018--2022. HIV-1 pol gene sequences were generated, and the presence of HIV-1 DRM was assessed.","The abstract and methods explicitly state that HIV-1 pol gene sequences were generated from the study cohort. The methods describe isolation of HIV-1 RNA from patient plasma and downstream sequencing, indicating sequences were obtained from patient samples."
37495103,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No.,HIV-1 study sequences were analysed for the presence of DRM using the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (HIVdb Program). DRM were classified according to the WHO list of mutations.,"The paper describes genotypic analysis (sequence-based detection of drug resistance mutations) and interpretation via Stanford HIVdb and WHO mutation lists, but it does not describe any phenotypic or in vitro susceptibility testing (no cell-culture or phenotypic assay, no IC50/IC90 or fold-change data). Therefore no in vitro drug susceptibility data were reported."
37495103,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,Not reported / No accession numbers provided.,"HIV-1 study sequences were analysed for the presence of DRM using the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (HIVdb Program).

There is no explicit mention that study sequences were submitted to GenBank, LANL, or other public repositories, so public availability is not reported in the paper."
37495103,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,No GenBank accession numbers are provided in the paper.,"HIV-1 sequences were further analysed using Sequencher 4.1 software (GeneCodesCorporation, Ann Arbor, MI). HIV-1 study sequences were analysed for the presence of DRM using the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (HIVdb Program).","Although the paper describes sequence generation and analysis, it does not list any GenBank accession numbers or a statement of sequence deposition; therefore no accession numbers can be extracted from the text."
37495103,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Sequencing was performed on the study cohort of 271 patients (sequencing attempted); 237 patients had sequences reported for variant analysis.,"The study cohort included 271 patients who were on first-line ART and visited Novosibirsk Regional AIDS/HIV Clinical Hospital between March 2018 and August 2022. Out of 237 study patients, the following HIV-1 genetic variants were identified: CRF63_02A was detected in 81.9% of the patients, sub-subtype A6 in 14.7%, CRF02_AG in 1.7%, subtype B in 1.3%, and CRF03_A6B in 0.4%.","The paper enrols 271 patients and states that HIV-1 pol sequences were generated for the cohort, indicating sequencing was attempted for 271 individuals. However, the results specifically describe subtype data ""Out of 237 study patients,"" which indicates that sequence data were successfully obtained and reported for 237 individuals. Thus, sequencing was attempted on 271 patients with 237 sequences available for variant/subtype analysis."
37495103,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Russia (Novosibirsk region).,"Patterns of HIV-1 drug resistance among HIV-infected patients receiving first-line antiretroviral therapy in Novosibirsk Region, Russia. The study cohort included 271 patients who were on first-line ART and visited Novosibirsk Regional AIDS/HIV Clinical Hospital between March 2018 and August 2022.","The title and methods specify the study was conducted in the Novosibirsk region, and patients were recruited from the Novosibirsk Regional AIDS/HIV Clinical Hospital, indicating all sequenced samples originated from Russia."

Reverse transcription and PCR were performed ... to amplify the HIV-1 PR-RT fragment (1302 bp).","The methods specify that RNA was extracted from patient plasma and then reverse transcribed and PCR-amplified for sequencing, therefore plasma specimens were the source material sequenced."
37495103,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Yes.,All patients had undetectable viral load (VL) levels for 3--6 months while taking ART with further virological failure. HIV-1 DRMs were detected in 54.6% (148/271) of the study patients with virological failure (Supplementary File S1.A).,"The cohort consisted of patients who experienced virological failure while on first-line ART; the reported resistance analyses and sequences therefore derive from individuals who failed treatment, confirming sequences were obtained from such patients."
37495103,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No (they were clinic patients in a real-world setting).,The study cohort included 271 patients who were on first-line ART and visited Novosibirsk Regional AIDS/HIV Clinical Hospital between March 2018 and August 2022. This report delivers results on the efficacy of HIV-1 ART and treatment adherence in real-world practice settings.,"Patients are described as clinic attendees and the authors emphasize that this is real-world clinical practice data; there is no mention of enrollment in a clinical trial or trial identifiers, so they were not trial participants."

Next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on iseq platform by using i1 V2 300 cycles reagent kit (Illumina, USA).","The Methods section states that Sanger sequencing was used for the partial pol amplicons, and that NGS libraries (Nextera) were prepared and sequenced on an Illumina iSeq platform for NFLG, indicating both sequencing technologies were employed."
37381002,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma from EDTA-anticoagulated blood samples (200 µl plasma used for RNA extraction).,"Pol gene of HIV-1 viruses in blood samples of EDTA anticoagulants from 398 patients with failed antiviral treatment was successfully amplified by using an in-house assay. Viral RNA was extracted from 200 µl plasma sample following the instructions of the MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I (Roche, Switzerland).","The Methods describe extraction of viral RNA from 200 µl plasma taken from EDTA-anticoagulated blood, indicating that plasma samples were the material sequenced."
37381002,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Yes — sequences were obtained from individuals with ART failure (virological failure; viral load ≥ 1000 copies/ml).,"This retrospective study aimed to characterize the distribution of HIV-1 genotypes and the prevalence of drug resistance mutations in people with antiretroviral treatment (ART) failure in Suzhou City, China. From 2017 to 2020, 450 people living with HIV who have received antiviral therapy for more than 1 year were confirmed to be ineffective (viral load ≥ 1000 copies/ml) in Suzhou city. Among these ART failure patients, a total of 398 viral pol gene sequences were successfully sequenced.","The Abstract and Results repeatedly state that the population studied were ART failure patients with viral loads ≥1000 copies/ml and that sequences were generated from these individuals, so the sequences originated from people with virological failure on treatment."
37381002,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — the study was retrospective and observational, not a clinical trial.","This retrospective study aimed to characterize the distribution of HIV-1 genotypes and the prevalence of drug resistance mutations in people with antiretroviral treatment (ART) failure in Suzhou City, China. From 2017 to 2020, 450 people living with HIV who have received antiviral therapy for more than 1 year were confirmed to be ineffective (viral load ≥ 1000 copies/ml) in Suzhou city.","The paper explicitly describes the work as a retrospective study of routine ART failure cases and does not reference any clinical trial enrollment, protocol, or trial identifiers, indicating this was not a clinical trial."
37381002,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes — all sequenced individuals were people who had received antiretroviral therapy and experienced treatment failure.,"This retrospective study aimed to characterize the distribution of HIV-1 genotypes and the prevalence of drug resistance mutations in people with antiretroviral treatment (ART) failure in Suzhou City, China. From 2017 to 2020, 450 people living with HIV who have received antiviral therapy for more than 1 year were confirmed to be ineffective (viral load ≥ 1000 copies/ml) in Suzhou city.","The study population is defined as people with ART failure who had received antiviral therapy for more than one year, so the sequences came from individuals with prior ARV exposure."
37381002,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Primarily nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs); protease inhibitors (PIs) are also discussed (resistance detected), suggesting exposure or relevance to PIs.","The overall prevalence of drug-resistant mutations in cases with ART failure was 64.57% (257/398), including 45.48% (181/398) for nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) mutations, 63.32% (252/398) for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) mutations, and 3.02% (12/398) for protease inhibitors (PIs) mutations. The regimen consisted of TDF/AZT, 3TC and EFV/NVP is currently the most common acquired free first-line treatment in China.","The authors report resistance frequencies for NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs and note the commonly used first-line regimen (TDF/AZT + 3TC + EFV/NVP), indicating that patients had been exposed primarily to NRTIs and NNRTIs, with some PI relevance."
37381002,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"The paper does not list individual treatment histories, but states the common first-line regimen (TDF or AZT + 3TC + EFV or NVP) and reports resistance analyses for many drugs (e.g., ABC, AZT, D4T, DDI, FTC, 3TC, TDF, DOR, EFV, NVP, ETR, RPV and several PIs such as ATV, FPV, IDV, LPV, NFV, SQV, TPV).","The regimen consisted of TDF/AZT, 3TC and EFV/NVP is currently the most common acquired free first-line treatment in China. For NRTIs, the resistant frequency to ABC, AZT, D4T, DDI, FTC, 3TC and TDF were 45.48% (181/398), 15.08% (60/398), 31.66% (126/398), 45.98% (183/398), 45.23% (180/398), 45.23% (180/398) and 28.14% (112/398), respectively.","While the paper reports population-level commonly used regimens (TDF/AZT + 3TC + EFV/NVP) and provides resistance frequencies across many specific drugs, it does not provide patient-level ARV histories. Therefore the listed drugs reflect likely exposures and the drugs analyzed for resistance, but exact individual drug histories are not reported."
37498738,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes. The paper reports near full-length HIV-1 proviral sequences obtained from participant PBMCs using PCR and next-generation sequencing.,"Near full-length HIV-1 proviral polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing was applied to longitudinal peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples to assess proviral evolution and the potential emergence of drug resistance mutations (DRMs). PCR and NGS for bulk sequences was performed for the 3 time points of the 101 individuals participating in the ESS, resulting in a total of 297 NGS sequences.","The Methods and Results explicitly describe performing near full-length proviral PCR and next-generation sequencing on PBMC samples from study participants and report the number of NGS sequences generated, demonstrating that HIV sequences from patient samples were obtained."
37498738,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No. The paper does not report in vitro phenotypic drug susceptibility assays; it reports genotypic/resistance mutation analysis from sequencing only.,"DRM detection was done with MinVar using a frequency threshold of 2% to detect minor variants, as opposed to the usually accepted clinically relevant threshold of 15%. Near full-length HIV-1 proviral polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing was applied to longitudinal peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples to assess proviral evolution and the potential emergence of drug resistance mutations (DRMs).","All described resistance analyses are based on sequencing (genotypic detection of DRMs using MinVar and NGS data). There is no mention of phenotypic or in vitro susceptibility testing (culture-based phenotypic assays) in Methods or Results, so no in vitro drug susceptibility data were reported."
37498738,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,Not explicitly in the main text. Data availability is referenced but specific public sequence accession details are not provided in the main text and are said to be described in Supplementary Appendix 6.,***Data availability.*** Data availability is described in Supplementary Appendix 6 .,"The main article does not list GenBank or other accession numbers; it only refers readers to Supplementary Appendix 6 for data availability.

No GenBank accession numbers are listed; the paper refers to Supplementary Appendix 6 for data availability.,***Data availability.*** Data availability is described in Supplementary Appendix 6 .,"The supplied paper content does not include any GenBank accession numbers or explicit sequence accession listings; it only notes that data availability is described in the supplementary appendix, so accession numbers (if any) are not present in the main text."
37498738,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,"Samples were obtained from 101 individuals in the ESS; sequencing produced 297 NGS sequences overall, and detailed longitudinal consensus analyses were performed for 43 individuals with three successful time-point consensus sequences.","The ESS ( NCT00537966 ) enrolled 101 people with HIV (PWH) from the Zurich Primary HIV Infection Study and Swiss HIV Cohort Study. PCR and NGS for bulk sequences was performed for the 3 time points of the 101 individuals participating in the ESS, resulting in a total of 297 NGS sequences. One hundred sixty-three NGS sequences from 43 participants (25 on DTG monotherapy and 18 on cART) were selected, as all of these 43 had 3 time points with successful consensus sequences (1yaas, ESS wk0, ESS wk48).",The Methods state enrollment of 101 participants and that PCR/NGS was performed yielding 297 sequences. The Results clarify that 43 participants had full sets of consensus sequences across the main time points and were the focus of the longitudinal consensus analyses.
37498738,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Switzerland.,The ESS ( NCT00537966 ) enrolled 101 people with HIV (PWH) from the Zurich Primary HIV Infection Study and Swiss HIV Cohort Study. Our study has strength and limitations. Strengths are that we studied the HIV-1 reservoir in well-characterized participants from an RCT with highly sensitive methods.,"Participants were enrolled from the Zurich Primary HIV Infection Study and the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, indicating the cohort and samples are from Switzerland (Zurich/Swiss cohorts)."
37498738,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Calendar years are not specified in the provided text; samples are described relative to treatment time points (ART start, 1 year after ART start, ESS week 0, ESS week 48) spanning 48 weeks but no calendar years are given.","The 4 selected time points were: ART start, 1 year after ART start, ESS week 0, and ESS week 48.

At Early Simplified Study (ESS) week 0, participants were randomly assigned to dolutegravir monotherapy or combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).",The manuscript describes longitudinal sampling in relation to ART initiation and study weeks but does not provide calendar year ranges for when samples were collected; therefore specific years cannot be determined from the main text.
37498738,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,"No. Samples were not cloned; single-genome dilution and whole-genome amplification were used for single-provirus analysis and PCR amplicons were sequenced, but no cloning into vectors is described.","DNA was diluted to single provirus according to droplet digital PCR results and Poisson distribution, and whole genome amplification was performed using the REPLIg Midi Kit (100) (Qiagen) ... Each well with amplified DNA was subjected to PCR, and HIV-1 PCR-positive wells were sequenced as described above. For each sample, the PCR approach with a positive result was used for next-generation sequencing (NGS).","The described workflow uses limiting-dilution (single-genome) approaches and whole-genome amplification followed by PCR and NGS; there is no mention of molecular cloning steps (e.g., cloning into plasmid vectors) prior to sequencing."
37498738,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Near full-length proviral genomes were sequenced, and analyses specifically report gag, pol (including protease, reverse transcriptase, integrase), and env regions.","Average pairwise diversity was calculated and longitudinally assessed for the 3 main genomic regions, for 139 (85%) samples for gag, 147 (90%) for pol, and 123 (75%) for env. As participants are on DTG monotherapy, DRM detection in single proviruses was focused on integrase.","The study performed near full-length proviral sequencing and explicitly reports diversity and DRM analyses for gag, pol, and env, and focused DRM analysis on integrase (part of pol), indicating those genes/regions were sequenced and analyzed."
37498738,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of near full-length HIV-1 proviral PCR amplicons (bulk NGS) and single-genome amplification followed by sequencing; consensus assembly used SmaltAlign.,"Near full-length HIV-1 proviral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed ... For each sample, the PCR approach with a positive result was used for next-generation sequencing (NGS). Majority consensus sequences assembly from NGS reads was done with SmaltAlign.","Methods explicitly state use of near full-length PCR followed by NGS for bulk sequencing, and single-genome amplification for single proviruses, with downstream assembly of NGS reads using SmaltAlign, indicating NGS-based methods were used."
37498738,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (DNA and RNA) and co-culture virus from PBMCs were used; proviral DNA from PBMCs was the primary material sequenced.,We used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or co-culture virus from 4 different time points: (i) at ART start (as) ... DNA and RNA was simultaneously isolated from 5 million PBMCs using AllPrep Mini kit (Qiagen) ... Near full-length HIV-1 proviral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed ...,"The Methods describe isolating DNA/RNA from PBMCs and performing near full-length proviral PCR on that material; co-culture virus is also mentioned as an input for some time points, so PBMC-derived proviral DNA was the primary sequenced sample type."
37498738,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,No. Participants showed sustained virological suppression over 48 weeks and the paper reports no viral failure during the study; one individual with a detected mutation did not show viral failure over an additional 3 years.,"Our recent randomized clinical trial comparing a switch to dolutegravir monotherapy with continuation of cART in early-treated individuals demonstrated sustained virological suppression over 48 weeks. Furthermore, this individual did not show viral failure on DTG monotherapy over an additional 3 years; thus, this mutation was most likely not selected by DTG monotherapy.","The trial participants were virologically suppressed throughout the study period, and no instances of virological failure were reported in the analyzed cohort; the specific example given (an individual with G140R) explicitly notes absence of viral failure, supporting that sequences were not from individuals with treatment failure during study follow-up."
37498738,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"Yes. Participants were enrolled in the Early Simplified Study (ESS), a randomized clinical trial (NCT00537966) comparing switch to dolutegravir monotherapy versus continuation of cART.",Our recent randomized clinical trial comparing a switch to dolutegravir monotherapy with continuation of cART in early-treated individuals demonstrated sustained virological suppression over 48 weeks. The ESS ( NCT00537966 ) enrolled 101 people with HIV (PWH) from the Zurich Primary HIV Infection Study and Swiss HIV Cohort Study.,"The manuscript describes the work as part of the randomized clinical trial ESS (with clinicaltrials.gov identifier), confirming participants were enrolled in a clinical trial."
37498738,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"Yes. The participants were early-treated individuals who had initiated combination ART prior to randomization and some sequences (e.g., transmitted DRMs) were from initial plasma before undergoing cART.","At Early Simplified Study (ESS) week 0, participants were randomly assigned to dolutegravir monotherapy or combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Transmitted DRMs were present in 19% (n = 8) of all 43 participants as detected by Sanger sequencing in genotypic resistance test from initial plasma before undergoing cART.","The study population comprises individuals who had started ART (cART) and were then switched to either DTG monotherapy or continued cART; transmitted DRMs were also detected from initial plasma prior to cART, indicating prior or baseline ARV exposure and relevance to sequencing."
37498738,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"The paper explicitly documents use of an integrase inhibitor (dolutegravir) for the monotherapy group and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for others; specific cART components are not enumerated in the main text, but analyses and DRMs concern reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase regions, implying prior exposure to regimens including nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and/or other classes commonly used in cART.","At Early Simplified Study (ESS) week 0, participants were randomly assigned to dolutegravir monotherapy or combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). DRM detection showed highest number of DRMs in RT and analyses focused on integrase for DTG monotherapy individuals.","Dolutegravir (an integrase strand transfer inhibitor) is explicitly mentioned as the monotherapy agent. The paper discusses reverse transcriptase and protease DRMs detected in proviral sequences, which implies participants had been exposed to RT-targeting drugs (e.g., NRTIs) and possibly protease inhibitors as part of prior cART, but exact regimen classes beyond dolutegravir and general cART are not detailed in the provided main text."
37498738,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Dolutegravir is explicitly reported (participants were switched to dolutegravir monotherapy); specific other individual drugs in the prior cART regimens are not listed in the provided main text and are not specified here.,"At Early Simplified Study (ESS) week 0, participants were randomly assigned to dolutegravir monotherapy or combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Bulk DRM analysis revealed emergence of G140R in 1 DTG monotherapy--treated individual.","The manuscript names dolutegravir as the drug used for monotherapy. The paper does not provide a list of other specific antiretroviral drugs used in participants' cART regimens within the main text; therefore, aside from dolutegravir, specific drug names are not ascertainable from the provided content (further details may be in supplementary material or prior trial publications)."
37439411,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,"Yes. The study reports HIV-1 RNA protease/reverse transcriptase sequences (genotypes) retrieved from patient samples in the ARCA database; these include 5,982 treatment-naïve individuals and 28,505 genotypes from 9,387 treatment-experienced PLWH.","We retrieved HIV-1 RNA protease/reverse transcriptase sequences, demographic and clinical data of adult PLWH from the Antiviral Response Cohort Analysis (ARCA) database, a public observational database containing data from more than 100 Italian centres for the study of resistance mutations to antiviral drugs for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections. We included 5982 naïves: 73.9% were males, median age was 39 years ... We retrieved 28,505 genotypes from 9,387 treatment-experienced PLWH (67.6% from males and 64.4% from Caucasians) and the median age was 43 years (IQR: 37--49).","The Methods explicitly state that HIV-1 RNA protease/RT sequences were retrieved from the ARCA database. The Results quantify the cohorts: 5,982 treatment-naïve individuals and 28,505 genotypes from 9,387 treatment-experienced patients, indicating that patient-derived sequences (genotypes) were reported and analyzed."
37439411,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No. The paper does not report in vitro phenotypic susceptibility assays; it reports genotypic resistance interpreted via the Stanford HIVdb (genotypic susceptibility scoring).,"The genotypic susceptibility score (GSS) for a single compound was obtained using the Stanford HIVdb genotypic resistance interpretation system: a GSS value of 0 corresponds to high-level resistance, 0.25 to intermediate resistance, 0.50 to low-level resistance, 0.75 to potential low-level resistance, and 1 to full susceptibility. All NNRTIs were fully active in more than 85%, according to GSS: full susceptibility was present in 85.7% for RPV and ETR, 86.9% for NVP, 89.3% for EFV and 92% for DOR.","The Methods describe use of a genotypic susceptibility score derived from sequence interpretation (Stanford HIVdb), and the Results present percentages of predicted susceptibility based on GSS. There is no mention of phenotypic or in vitro susceptibility testing (e.g., phenotypic assays), so only genotypic interpretation was reported."
37439411,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,"Partially: sequences were obtained from the public ARCA observational database, but the paper does not report deposition of sequence data to public repositories such as GenBank or provide accession numbers.","We retrieved HIV-1 RNA protease/reverse transcriptase sequences, demographic and clinical data of adult PLWH from the Antiviral Response Cohort Analysis (ARCA) database, a public observational database containing data from more than 100 Italian centres for the study of resistance mutations to antiviral drugs for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections. No funding was received to perform this study.","The Methods indicate sequence data were sourced from the ARCA database, which is described as public. However, nowhere in the manuscript are GenBank accession numbers or an explicit statement that sequences were deposited in repositories like GenBank; therefore while data came from a public database, the paper does not report separate public deposition of the sequences or provide accession identifiers."
37439411,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported in the paper.,"We retrieved HIV-1 RNA protease/reverse transcriptase sequences, demographic and clinical data of adult PLWH from the Antiviral Response Cohort Analysis (ARCA) database, a public observational database containing data from more than 100 Italian centres for the study of resistance mutations to antiviral drugs for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections. The manuscript does not list GenBank accession numbers or provide sequence deposition details.","Although the paper describes retrieving sequences from the ARCA database and analyzes thousands of genotypes, there is no section or statement listing GenBank accession numbers or other repository identifiers; therefore no accession numbers are reported."
37439411,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,"5,982 treatment-naïve individuals and 9,387 treatment-experienced individuals (total 15,369 individuals); the dataset included 28,505 genotypes from the treatment-experienced group.","We included 5982 naïves: 73.9% were males, median age was 39 years ... We retrieved 28,505 genotypes from 9,387 treatment-experienced PLWH (67.6% from males and 64.4% from Caucasians) and the median age was 43 years (IQR: 37--49).","The Results explicitly report cohort sizes: 5,982 treatment-naïve subjects and 28,505 genotypes from 9,387 treatment-experienced people living with HIV. Summing the two patient counts gives a total of 15,369 individuals represented in the sequencing dataset; the 28,505 figure refers to the number of genotypes (sequence tests) among the experienced group."
37439411,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Primarily Italy (data drawn from >100 Italian centres); some patients were born outside Italy (e.g., sub-Saharan Africa) but samples were from Italian centres.","We retrieved HIV-1 RNA protease/reverse transcriptase sequences, demographic and clinical data of adult PLWH from the Antiviral Response Cohort Analysis (ARCA) database, a public observational database containing data from more than 100 Italian centres for the study of resistance mutations to antiviral drugs for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections. Those PLWH born in Italy were the most represented group among subtypes B, F and CRF01_AE, while PLWH from sub-Saharan Africa were prevalent among CRF02_AG and C subtypes.","The study population was drawn from the ARCA cohort across Italian centres, so sequences originate from patients in Italy. The text notes patients' regions of birth (e.g., Italy, sub-Saharan Africa), but sequencing was performed within the Italian cohort rather than reporting sequences collected directly from other countries."
37439411,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,From 2000 to 2020.,Our study aims to describe the circulation of major resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) for NNRTIs in people living with HIV (PLWH) in Italy from 2000 to 2020. Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) was found in 12.5% and declined from 17.3% in 2000--2003 to 10.9% in 2016--2020.,"The Abstract and Results explicitly state the calendar time span analyzed (2000–2020) and present trends across the specified intervals, indicating that the sequenced samples cover that time period."
37439411,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No indication of cloning; the paper does not report that samples were cloned prior to sequencing.,"We retrieved HIV-1 RNA protease/reverse transcriptase sequences, demographic and clinical data of adult PLWH from the Antiviral Response Cohort Analysis (ARCA) database, a public observational database ... The HIV-1 genotype was considered based on all the tests available (cumulative genotype).",The Methods describe retrieval of RNA sequences and cumulative genotypes but do not describe cloning of viral genomes or single-genome sequencing; absence of any mention of cloning or cloning-related methods indicates samples were not reported as cloned prior to sequencing (likely standard population genotyping).
37439411,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,Protease and reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RNA protease/reverse transcriptase sequences).,"We retrieved HIV-1 RNA protease/reverse transcriptase sequences, demographic and clinical data of adult PLWH from the Antiviral Response Cohort Analysis (ARCA) database, a public observational database ... The HIV-1 genotype was considered based on all the tests available (cumulative genotype).","The Methods explicitly specify that HIV-1 RNA protease and reverse transcriptase sequences were retrieved and analyzed, indicating sequencing covered the protease and RT regions (pol gene)."
37439411,10,What method was used for sequencing?,"Not specified. The paper reports retrieval of HIV-1 PR/RT genotypes from the ARCA database (genotypic sequencing on RNA) but does not specify the sequencing platform or laboratory method (e.g., Sanger vs. next-generation sequencing).","We retrieved HIV-1 RNA protease/reverse transcriptase sequences, demographic and clinical data of adult PLWH from the Antiviral Response Cohort Analysis (ARCA) database, a public observational database ... The HIV-1 genotype was considered based on all the tests available (cumulative genotype).","Although the manuscript states that PR/RT genotypes were retrieved and that genotyping on RNA was performed in cases of virological failure, it does not describe technical sequencing methods or platforms. Therefore the precise sequencing method is not reported."
37439411,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,HIV-1 RNA (plasma viral RNA) genotypes were sequenced (genotyping on RNA in cases of detectable viraemia).,"We retrieved HIV-1 RNA protease/reverse transcriptase sequences, demographic and clinical data of adult PLWH from the Antiviral Response Cohort Analysis (ARCA) database, a public observational database ... This could be explained by the fact that genotyping on RNA was performed exclusively in cases of virological failure with detectable viraemia.","The Methods mention retrieval of HIV-1 RNA PR/RT sequences and the Discussion states genotyping on RNA was used for virological failure cases, indicating sequencing was performed on plasma viral RNA (standard clinical genotyping)."
37439411,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"Yes. Genotyping on RNA was performed in cases of virological failure with detectable viraemia, and the dataset includes many treatment-experienced individuals for whom genotypes were retrieved.","This could be explained by the fact that genotyping on RNA was performed exclusively in cases of virological failure with detectable viraemia. We retrieved 28,505 genotypes from 9,387 treatment-experienced PLWH ...","The Discussion explicitly states that genotyping on RNA was performed exclusively in cases of virological failure with detectable viraemia, and the Results show a large number of genotypes from treatment-experienced patients, demonstrating that sequences include those from individuals with virological failure while on treatment."
37439411,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No. Patients were drawn from a public observational cohort (ARCA); the study is observational and real-life, not a clinical trial.","We retrieved HIV-1 RNA protease/reverse transcriptase sequences, demographic and clinical data of adult PLWH from the Antiviral Response Cohort Analysis (ARCA) database, a public observational database containing data from more than 100 Italian centres ... The strengths of the study are the large sample size and the wide representation of PLWH in care across Italy, the national representativeness of the real-life setting, the enrolment of individuals typically not included in randomized trials ...",The manuscript repeatedly describes ARCA as a public observational database and characterizes the study as a real-life cohort analysis; there is no indication that participants were enrolled in a clinical trial.
37439411,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"Yes. The paper includes 28,505 genotypes from 9,387 treatment-experienced PLWH and defines PDR based on genotypes of experienced individuals with previous ARV exposure.","We retrieved 28,505 genotypes from 9,387 treatment-experienced PLWH (67.6% from males and 64.4% from Caucasians) ... pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR) identifies the sum of drug resistance mutations detected in all genotypes of experienced PLWH with previous ARV drug exposure initiating or reinitiating ART, including both transmitted and acquired RAMs, at the moment of the analysis.","The Results and Methods explicitly describe inclusion of treatment-experienced individuals and define PDR as mutations in genotypes of persons with prior ARV exposure, confirming sequences include individuals previously treated with antiretroviral drugs."
37439411,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"The paper specifically reports prior exposure to NNRTIs as a predictor of resistance; it also references other ARV classes introduced over time such as integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), but does not provide a comprehensive class-by-class breakdown of prior exposures.","Predictors of PDR were ... previous exposure to any NNRTIs (aOR = 2.31, 95% CI: 2.14--2.49, p < 0.001) ... probably because of the introduction of other classes as anchor drugs, in particular, integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) and thanks to the higher efficacy and tolerability of later NNRTIs.","The Methods/Results highlight previous exposure to NNRTIs as an analyzed variable and discuss the historical introduction of other classes (notably INSTIs). However, the manuscript does not present a detailed breakdown of exposures to all ARV classes for the cohort, so NNRTIs are the primary class explicitly documented as prior exposure."
37439411,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"The paper does not provide individual-level drug histories listing which specific drugs each person received. It discusses NNRTI agents in the context of susceptibility (e.g., rilpivirine [RPV], etravirine [ETR], nevirapine [NVP], efavirenz [EFV], doravirine [DOR]) and notes prior exposure to NNRTIs generally, but does not report per-patient drug lists or counts.","All NNRTIs were fully active in more than 85%, according to GSS: full susceptibility was present in 85.7% for RPV and ETR, 86.9% for NVP, 89.3% for EFV and 92% for DOR. Predictors of PDR were ... previous exposure to any NNRTIs (aOR = 2.31, 95% CI: 2.14--2.49, p < 0.001).","While the manuscript names NNRTI drugs when discussing susceptibility and references prior exposure to 'any NNRTIs' as a predictor, it does not include tables or text enumerating which specific drugs were received by which individuals. Therefore specific per-patient drug histories are not reported; only class-level exposure and mention of several NNRTI agents appear in the analysis."
37537871,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes — the paper reports HIV sequences derived from patient plasma samples.,"A total of 77 plasma samples, collected from 70 male and 7 female patients ages 18 to 68, were obtained from the Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong between 2002 and 2014 (Supplemental Table 1). An ONT workflow was developed for detecting ARV resistance in HIV with direct sequencing of vRNA extracted from plasma samples.","The Methods explicitly state that 77 plasma samples from hospital patients were collected and describe extraction of viral RNA and sequencing workflows (ONT, Illumina, and Sanger). The Conclusion also states the workflow was applied to direct sequencing of vRNA from plasma, indicating sequences were generated from patient samples."
37537871,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No — the paper does not report phenotypic (in vitro) drug susceptibility assays; it reports genotypic resistance profiling inferred from sequence data.,"A new ONT sequencing-based method for profiling DRMs in HIV quasispecies was developed and validated. An ARV resistance report was generated using SierraPy, based on the consensus sequences of all quasispecies found within a sample.","The manuscript describes sequencing-based detection of drug resistance mutations and generation of computational ARV resistance reports from consensus sequences. There is no mention of phenotypic susceptibility testing, culture-based assays, or in vitro phenotypic resistance measurements; therefore only genotypic (sequence-based) resistance data were provided."
37537871,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No — the paper does not report deposition of patient-derived HIV sequences in public sequence repositories.,"ClusterV is open-source software (BSD 3-Clause license), hosted by GitHub at https://github.com/HKU-BAL/ClusterV. The Data Availability section mentions the software but does not report sequence accession numbers or sequence repository deposition.","The only explicit Data Availability statement refers to the open-source software (ClusterV) on GitHub. The manuscript does not provide GenBank or other sequence database accession numbers nor a statement that patient-derived sequences were deposited, so sequences were not reported as made publicly available in the paper."
37537871,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported — no GenBank accession numbers are provided in the paper.,"ClusterV is open-source software (BSD 3-Clause license), hosted by GitHub at https://github.com/HKU-BAL/ClusterV. The manuscript does not list any GenBank accession numbers or other sequence repository identifiers.","A search of the Methods, Results, Data Availability, and Supplemental references in the provided text yields no GenBank accession numbers or sequence deposition statements, so no accession numbers were reported."
37537871,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,77 individuals (77 plasma samples) had samples obtained for sequencing.,"A total of 77 plasma samples, collected from 70 male and 7 female patients ages 18 to 68, were obtained from the Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong between 2002 and 2014 (Supplemental Table 1). Fifty-nine out of 77 plasma samples were successfully sequenced using the ONT workflow.","The Methods state 77 plasma samples were collected from patients (70 male, 7 female). Although only 59 of those were successfully sequenced by the ONT workflow, samples were obtained from 77 individuals."
37537871,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Hong Kong (samples were collected at Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong).",A total of 77 plasma samples ... were obtained from the Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong between 2002 and 2014 (Supplemental Table 1). The study repeatedly refers to samples and clinical context from Hong Kong in Methods and Results.,The Sample Collection explicitly names Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong as the source of patient plasma samples; no other countries of origin for patient samples are described.
37537871,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Samples were obtained between 2002 and 2014.,A total of 77 plasma samples ... were obtained from the Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong between 2002 and 2014 (Supplemental Table 1).,"The Sample Collection section explicitly gives the collection time window as 2002–2014, indicating the years the patient samples were obtained."
37537871,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No — samples were not cloned; viral RNA was reverse-transcribed and long-region PCR amplicons were directly sequenced.,"Then, 8 μL of extracted RNA was subjected to DNA removal using ezDNase™, reverse transcription with LunaScript RT SuperMix (5X), and amplification targeting the long genomic region (NC_001802.1:1413--7363, amplicon length: 5951 base pairs). In conclusion, an ONT workflow was developed for detecting ARV resistance in HIV with direct sequencing of vRNA extracted from plasma samples.",The Methods describe direct RT-PCR amplification of viral RNA and preparation of sequencing libraries for ONT and Illumina; there is no mention of molecular cloning of amplicons into vectors prior to sequencing. The paper explicitly describes direct sequencing of vRNA-derived amplicons.
37537871,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Protease, reverse transcriptase (RT), and integrase regions were sequenced (long amplicon covering regions associated with these ARV-targeted genes).","Amplicons were generated targeting the long genomic region (NC_001802.1: 1413--7363, amplicon length: 5951 base pairs). Sanger sequencing results covering protease and reverse transcriptase (amino acid position 1--401) were available for 54 samples ... results for integrase were only available in 16 samples.","The long amplicon coordinates and the text describing Sanger results covering protease, RT, and integrase indicate the study sequenced the protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase coding regions relevant to ARV resistance profiling."
37537871,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing (GridION) was the primary method; Sanger sequencing and Illumina MiSeq short-read sequencing were also used for comparison/validation.,"For nanopore sequencing, libraries were constructed ... and sequenced on ONT GridION for 48 hours using the SUP basecalling mode. Sanger sequencing: Protease and reverse transcriptase nucleotide sequences were determined by our in-house Sanger sequencing-based genotypic resistance test, whereas the sequences of integrase were characterized by another in-house Sanger sequencing protocol. For Illumina sequencing, libraries were prepared with the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit ... and sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq System (250 × 2 cycles).","The Methods section contains dedicated subsections for Nanopore, Sanger, and Illumina sequencing describing protocols and platforms. The study developed and evaluated an ONT long-read workflow while using Sanger and Illumina data as references for validation."
37537871,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma samples — viral RNA (vRNA) extracted from patient plasma was sequenced.,"A total of 77 plasma samples ... were obtained from the Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong between 2002 and 2014 (Supplemental Table 1). In conclusion, an ONT workflow was developed for detecting ARV resistance in HIV with direct sequencing of vRNA extracted from plasma samples.","The Sample Collection and Conclusion explicitly state that plasma samples were collected and that vRNA from plasma was used for sequencing, indicating that plasma-derived viral RNA samples were sequenced."
37537871,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Not reported / unclear — the paper does not explicitly state whether sampled individuals were experiencing virological failure while on treatment.,"In this study, 4 out of 59 (6.8%) samples were found to have quasispecies with DRMs. Treatment modifications were recommended for these cases. However, both patients were lost to follow-up and thus clinical outcome could not be determined.","Although the paper discusses DRMs and recommends treatment modifications for some cases, it does not explicitly state prior treatment status or whether patients were experiencing virological failure at the time of sampling. The loss to follow-up and lack of longitudinal outcome data mean virological-failure status is not reported."
37537871,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No — the patients were clinical samples obtained from a hospital; there is no indication they were enrolled in a clinical trial.,"A total of 77 plasma samples ... were obtained from the Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong between 2002 and 2014 (Supplemental Table 1). The Methods and Data Availability describe laboratory workflows and software, with no mention of a clinical trial or trial identifiers.","The paper describes retrospective/sample collection from hospital patients and laboratory validation of sequencing workflows. There is no mention of a clinical trial, trial registration, or trial protocol, so the patients were not part of a reported clinical trial."
37537871,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Not reported / unclear — the paper does not provide explicit antiretroviral treatment histories for the sampled individuals.,A total of 77 plasma samples ... were obtained from the Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong between 2002 and 2014 (Supplemental Table 1). The manuscript discusses treatment-naïve patients in the Discussion but does not provide individual ARV histories in Methods or Results.,"While the Discussion refers generally to treatment-naïve patients and to the implications of detecting minor DRMs, the Methods and Results do not document patients' prior ARV exposure or treatment histories. Therefore it is not possible from the paper to determine which individuals had prior ARV therapy."
37537871,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not reported — the paper does not provide patients' ARV treatment histories or list which drug classes individuals had received prior to sequencing.,"The Methods describe sample collection and sequencing workflows but do not include ARV treatment histories for the cohort. The manuscript reports detection of DRMs associated with NRTIs, NNRTIs, and protease inhibitors, but this refers to inferred resistance mutations rather than documented prior drug exposure.","The presence of mutations conferring resistance to particular drug classes (NRTI, NNRTI, PI) reflects sequence findings, not documented patient drug exposure. Since the paper does not report individual treatment histories, drug classes received prior to sampling are not provided."
37537871,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not reported — the paper does not list specific antiretroviral drugs received by study participants prior to sequencing.,"The Results and Discussion detail DRMs and resistance levels to various drugs (for example, mentions of abacavir, lamivudine, tenofovir, efavirenz, etc.) in the context of inferred resistance. The Methods and cohort description do not include patient-level ARV drug histories or treatment regimens.","Although the authors describe the resistance implications of detected mutations (naming drugs that would be affected), they do not provide actual treatment histories or list which drugs participants had received. Therefore specific drugs received before sequencing are not reported in the paper."
37540331,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,No.,HIV-1 RNA levels were quantified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays with a detection limit of 47 copies/ml. The datasets used and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon request.,"I searched the Methods, Results, and Data availability sections for any mention of sequencing, sequence data, or sequence deposition. The Methods describe quantification of HIV-1 RNA by PCR (viral load) but do not describe any sequencing procedures or reporting of sequence data. The Data availability statement indicates datasets are available on request, and there are no GenBank accession numbers or descriptions of sequence generation in the paper, so the paper does not report HIV sequences from patient samples."
37540331,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No.,HIV-1 RNA levels were quantified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays with a detection limit of 47 copies/ml. The datasets used and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon request.,"I examined the Methods, Results, and Discussion for any phenotypic or in vitro susceptibility assays (e.g., phenotypic resistance testing, IC50/EC50 measurements, or culture-based susceptibility). The paper only describes clinical measurements (viral load by PCR, CD4 counts, routine labs) and reports no laboratory phenotypic susceptibility testing. Therefore no in vitro drug susceptibility data are reported."
37540331,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No (no sequences reported and no public sequence deposition referenced).,"The datasets used and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon request. This study was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20191005044984N1, registered at 2019--12-21).","I searched for statements about public deposition of sequences (e.g., GenBank accession numbers or links to sequence repositories) and found none. The only data availability statement indicates datasets are available on request from the corresponding author, which implies no public sequence repository deposition is provided in the paper. Thus sequences were not made publicly available because sequence data are not reported and no public accession numbers are given."
37540331,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,The datasets used and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon request. HIV-1 RNA levels were quantified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays with a detection limit of 47 copies/ml.,I scanned the manuscript for any GenBank accession numbers or other sequence repository identifiers and found none. The paper does not describe sequence generation or deposition; therefore no GenBank accession numbers are provided.
37540331,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,None — the paper does not report any HIV sequencing of samples.,"HIV-1 RNA levels were quantified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays with a detection limit of 47 copies/ml. Finally, 85 patients were randomly assigned to receive TAF plus DTG regimen (n = 43) or to continue the previous 3DR (n = 42).","Although the study enrolled and followed clinical samples from participants (85 randomized participants), the Methods and Results describe only viral load quantification by PCR and routine laboratory tests; there is no description of sequencing any participant samples. Therefore zero individuals had samples sequenced for HIV in this report."
37540331,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable (no sequences). Participants were recruited in Iran.,This open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted in treatment-experienced people with HIV who had HIV-RNA < 47 copies/mL for at least two years. PLWH admitted to the HIV clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex (affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences) were evaluated for study enrollment.,"There were no sequenced samples in this paper. However, the study site and participants are described as being from Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Iran), and the Discussion notes this is the first trial carried out in Iran. Thus while no sequences exist, the participants/samples originate from Iran."
37540331,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable (no sequences reported).,"This study was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20191005044984N1, registered at 2019--12-21). Small sample size is the main limitation of the current study. The coincidence of patient enrollment and the outbreak of COVID-19 in Iran was the main reason for the small number of participants in this study.","The paper does not report any sequencing or provide dates of sequence sample collection. The registration date and mention of enrollment coinciding with the COVID-19 outbreak provide some study timing context (around 2019–2020), but since no sequencing was performed, there are no years for sequenced samples to report."
37540331,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not applicable — no sequencing or cloning reported.,HIV-1 RNA levels were quantified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays with a detection limit of 47 copies/ml. The datasets used and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon request.,"I reviewed the Methods for any molecular biology steps such as cloning, PCR amplification for sequencing, or plasmid construction; none are described. Only viral load PCR quantification is mentioned, so no sample cloning prior to sequencing occurred or is reported."
37540331,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,Not applicable — no HIV genes were sequenced in this study.,HIV-1 RNA levels were quantified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays with a detection limit of 47 copies/ml. The datasets used and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon request.,"There is no mention in the Methods or Results of sequencing any HIV genes (e.g., pol, env, gag). The paper focuses on clinical outcomes and viral load quantification; therefore no HIV genes were sequenced or reported."
37540331,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not applicable — no sequencing was performed; viral load was measured by PCR.,HIV-1 RNA levels were quantified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays with a detection limit of 47 copies/ml. This open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted in treatment-experienced people with HIV who had HIV-RNA < 47 copies/mL for at least two years.,"The only laboratory molecular method described is PCR for HIV-1 RNA quantification (viral load). No sequencing methods (Sanger, next-generation sequencing, etc.) are described, so no sequencing method is reported."
37540331,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Not applicable — no sequencing; the study performed viral load testing (presumably plasma) but the paper does not specify sample type for sequencing.,HIV-1 RNA levels were quantified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays with a detection limit of 47 copies/ml. PLWH admitted to the HIV clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex (affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences) were evaluated for study enrollment.,"The manuscript does not describe sequencing or the specimen types used for sequencing. It does describe viral load measurement by PCR, which is typically performed on plasma, but the paper does not explicitly state the sample type. Because no sequencing was done, there are no sequenced sample types to report."
37540331,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No — there were no sequences reported, and no virological failures occurred during the study.","HIV viral load remained undetectable (HIV-RNA < 47 copies/mL) at weeks 8, 24, and 48 in both groups, and no virological failure was detected during the study. HIV-1 RNA levels were quantified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays with a detection limit of 47 copies/ml.","The Results explicitly state that no virological failure was detected and viral loads remained undetectable for participants. In addition, no sequencing was performed. Therefore no sequences from individuals with virological failure exist in this report."
37540331,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,Yes — participants were enrolled in a registered randomized open-label non-inferiority clinical trial.,"This study was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20191005044984N1, registered at 2019--12-21) and conducted as an open-label randomized non-inferiority trial. Eligible patients were assigned to the intervention or control group using a simple randomization method.","The Methods state the study design and give a clinical trial registration number and registration date, and describe randomization and open-label non-inferiority trial procedures, confirming that patients were enrolled in a clinical trial."
37540331,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No — the paper does not report any HIV sequences; participants were treatment-experienced and on ART prior to enrollment.,"HIV-positive adults (≥ 18 years old) who were on ART, with undetectable viral load (HIV-RNA < 47 copies/mL), and CD4 > 200 cells/µL in the past two years were enrolled. The baseline ART regimen of most patients in both groups included two NRTIs and one NNRTI.","Although participants were treatment-experienced and had prior ARV exposure (on ART), the paper contains no sequencing data from these individuals. Thus the paper does not report sequences from previously treated individuals."
37540331,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not applicable for sequencing (no sequencing), but participants' baseline regimens mainly included two NRTIs plus one NNRTI; the study also involved NRTI (TAF) and INSTI (dolutegravir) during the trial.","The baseline ART regimen of most patients in both groups included two NRTIs and one NNRTI. The triple-drug regimen was changed to dual therapy including TAF 25 mg tablet (Altafir®, Tadbir Kalaye Jam) plus dolutegravir 50 mg tablet (Dolutegravir®, Aurobindo) once daily in the intervention group (TAF plus DTG).","The manuscript specifies the baseline ART classes for participants (two NRTIs plus one NNRTI). The intervention introduced TAF (an NRTI prodrug) plus dolutegravir (an INSTI). Because no sequencing was performed, the question about classes received 'before sample sequencing' is not applicable, but the drug classes used by participants are documented."
37540331,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not applicable for sequencing (no sequences). The paper reports classes (two NRTIs plus one NNRTI) but does not provide a comprehensive list of specific prior drugs for the cohort; the intervention drugs included TAF and dolutegravir.,"The baseline ART regimen of most patients in both groups included two NRTIs and one NNRTI. The triple-drug regimen was changed to dual therapy including TAF 25 mg tablet (Altafir®, Tadbir Kalaye Jam) plus dolutegravir 50 mg tablet (Dolutegravir®, Aurobindo) once daily in the intervention group (TAF plus DTG).","The manuscript states the general composition of baseline regimens (two NRTIs + one NNRTI) but does not list specific drugs used by each participant prior to enrollment. The intervention drugs (TAF and dolutegravir) are specified, but since no sequencing occurred, there are no sequences tied to particular prior drugs."
37520425,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,"HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing (GRT) from biobanked samples for those with an HIV VL ≥50 copies/mL. A direct sequencing reaction was done using 6 overlapping primers, and assembly program (BioEdit 7.2) was used for sequence analysis.","The Methods state that GRT was performed from biobanked plasma samples and describe RNA extraction, RT-PCR amplification and a direct sequencing reaction using overlapping primers with sequence assembly. These statements indicate that HIV sequences were generated from patient plasma samples."
37520425,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No.,HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing (GRT) from biobanked samples for those with an HIV VL ≥50 copies/mL. Mutations were interpreted according to the Stanford University's HIV Drug Resistance Database Program version 9.2 (http://hivdb.stanford.edu).,"The laboratory methods describe genotypic (sequence-based) resistance testing and interpretation via the Stanford database. There is no mention of phenotypic or in vitro susceptibility assays (e.g., phenotypic fold-change assays or cell-based susceptibility testing), so only genotypic data were reported, not in vitro phenotypic susceptibility data."
37520425,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,"Yes, some sequences were deposited in GenBank.",The reported protease and reverse transcriptase sequences are available in GenBank (accession number OQ627458-OQ627474 ). The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.,"The Methods explicitly state that the protease and reverse transcriptase sequences have GenBank accession numbers, indicating public deposition. The additional data availability statement indicates other study data are available on request, but the GenBank statement confirms sequence deposition."
37520425,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,OQ627458–OQ627474.,The reported protease and reverse transcriptase sequences are available in GenBank (accession number OQ627458-OQ627474 ).,The Methods directly list the GenBank accession range OQ627458-OQ627474 as the identifiers for the reported protease and reverse transcriptase sequences.
37520425,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Pre-treatment samples were available for 25 of 30 viremic DTG patients (14 of those were successfully sequenced); plasma samples at viremia were available for 13 of 30 patients (2 of those were successfully sequenced); in total sequencing was successful for 14 + 2 = 16 individuals.,"For patients with viremia at 12 months after starting DTG-based ART, blood plasma samples prior to treatment initiation were available for 25 of 30 (83%) patients. Of those, 14 of 25 (56%) samples were successfully PCR amplified and sequenced for PDR determination. Blood plasma samples at VL ≥50 copies/mL were available for 13 of 30 (43%) patients. PCR amplification and sequencing for determination of acquired and/or persisting HIV-1 drug resistance--associated mutations was successful for only 2 of 13 (15%) patients.","The Results give counts of available samples and of successful sequencing events: 25 pre-treatment samples were available (14 sequenced) and 13 samples at viremia were available (2 sequenced). Summing the successful sequencing yields 16 individuals with sequence data; the text does not state explicitly whether any individuals contributed both pre-treatment and viremia sequences, so the conservative interpretation is that sequencing was successful in 16 sample instances/individuals as reported."
37520425,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Tanzania.,"This is a retrospective, observational study nested within the Kilombero and Ulanga antiretroviral cohort (KIULARCO), a prospective cohort of PWH. The cohort includes patients seen at the Chronic Diseases Clinic of Ifakara, the care and treatment center for PWH of the Saint Francis Referral Hospital, located in rural southeastern Tanzania.","The study population and setting are explicitly described as the KIULARCO cohort based in rural southeastern Tanzania (Ifakara and the Saint Francis Referral Hospital), so the sequenced samples came from patients in Tanzania."
37520425,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Samples were obtained from participants initiating NNRTI-based ART between 16 December 2016 and 15 December 2017, and DTG-based ART between 16 March 2019 and 15 September 2020; sequencing was performed on biobanked samples from those cohorts.","Two groups of PWH aged ≥15 years attending KIULARCO were included in the analysis: (1) treatment-naive patients initiating NNRTI-based ART between 16 December 2016 and 15 December 2017 (referred to as the NNRTI cohort) and (2) treatment-naive patients initiating DTG-based ART between 16 March 2019 and 15 September 2020 (referred to as the DTG cohort). GRT was performed using a validated in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol to determine the HIV-1 drug resistance--associated mutations for reverse transcriptase, protease, and INSTI.","The study defines the enrollment windows for the two cohorts; genotyping was performed on biobanked samples from participants in those cohorts, so the relevant sample collection periods were during the 2016–2017 and 2019–2020 enrollment windows."
37520425,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No — direct (population) sequencing was used rather than cloning.,"A direct sequencing reaction was done using 6 overlapping primers, and assembly program (BioEdit 7.2) was used for sequence analysis. Finally, all genotypic data were obtained through standard Sanger sequencing; rates of HIV-associated drug resistance mutations would possibly be higher if ultra-sensitive HIV-1 drug resistance testing by next-generation sequencing had been used.","The Methods describe a direct sequencing reaction and the Discussion states that genotypic data were obtained by standard Sanger sequencing, which implies population-direct sequencing rather than cloning of individual viral variants prior to sequencing."
37520425,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Protease and reverse transcriptase sequences were reported (the protocol targeted protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase/INSTI regions).","GRT was performed using a validated in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol to determine the HIV-1 drug resistance--associated mutations for reverse transcriptase, protease, and INSTI. The reported protease and reverse transcriptase sequences are available in GenBank (accession number OQ627458-OQ627474 ).","The laboratory protocol targeted protease, reverse transcriptase and INSTI (integrase) regions for mutation detection, and the Methods specify that protease and reverse transcriptase sequences were deposited in GenBank, indicating those genes were sequenced and reported."
37520425,10,What method was used for sequencing?,RT-PCR amplification followed by direct Sanger sequencing (population sequencing using 6 overlapping primers) and assembly with BioEdit.,"RNA was extracted from 150 μL of plasma using the PureLink Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA extracts were retrotranscribed and amplified using the HIV-1 Genotyping Kit Amplification Module (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific). A direct sequencing reaction was done using 6 overlapping primers, and assembly program (BioEdit 7.2) was used for sequence analysis. Finally, all genotypic data were obtained through standard Sanger sequencing; rates of HIV-associated drug resistance mutations would possibly be higher if ultra-sensitive HIV-1 drug resistance testing by next-generation sequencing had been used.","The Methods detail extraction, reverse transcription and PCR amplification, then a direct sequencing reaction with overlapping primers and sequence assembly; the Discussion confirms that standard Sanger sequencing was used. This indicates classical RT-PCR followed by population Sanger sequencing."
37520425,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Cryopreserved blood plasma samples (150 µL plasma) from a biobank.,"As per routine care and according to the Tanzania National Guidelines ... blood samples are stored in a biobank at −80°C for research purposes. RNA was extracted from 150 μL of plasma using the PureLink Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer's protocol.","The Methods state that blood samples were cryopreserved in a biobank and that RNA for genotyping was extracted from 150 µL of plasma, confirming that plasma samples were used for sequencing."
37520425,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"Sequencing was performed on samples from viremic individuals (VL ≥50 copies/mL), and some of those individuals had VL ≥1000 copies/mL, but it is not explicitly stated whether the successfully sequenced samples came from individuals meeting the virological failure definition (≥1000 copies/mL on two measurements).","For those with viremia in the DTG and NNRTI cohorts, 25 of 30 (83%) and 42 of 57 (74%) had a VL 50--999 copies/mL and 5 of 30 (17%) and 15 of 57 (26%) had VL ≥1000 copies/mL, respectively. PCR amplification and sequencing for determination of acquired and/or persisting HIV-1 drug resistance--associated mutations was successful for only 2 of 13 (15%) patients. No mutations associated with HIV-1 drug resistance were detected.","The Results provide VL distributions showing that some participants had VL ≥1000 copies/mL (the study's virological failure threshold). Genotyping was attempted on viremic samples and sequencing succeeded for a subset; however the paper does not explicitly link which of the successfully sequenced samples corresponded to individuals who met the formal virological failure definition (≥1000 on two measurements). Thus, while sequences were obtained from viremic individuals and some individuals met the ≥1000 threshold, the text does not definitively state that sequenced samples were from confirmed virological failure cases."
37520425,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — this was an observational cohort study, not a clinical trial.","This is a retrospective, observational study nested within the Kilombero and Ulanga antiretroviral cohort (KIULARCO), a prospective cohort of PWH. We compared virological suppression at 12 months, after treatment initiation in the two cohorts of participants aged ≥15 years, initiating DTG- based and NNRTI-based ART.",The study is described as retrospective and observational nested within an existing prospective cohort (KIULARCO) and compares programmatic ART rollout cohorts; there is no indication that participants were enrolled in an interventional clinical trial.
37520425,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"No — treatment-experienced individuals were excluded; the report focuses on treatment-naive participants, so sequences were from those who had not previously received ART.",Two groups of PWH aged ≥15 years attending KIULARCO were included in the analysis: (1) treatment-naive patients initiating NNRTI-based ART ... and (2) treatment-naive patients initiating DTG-based ART.... We excluded ... treatment-experienced patients (assessed in the baseline questionnaire by asking if they had ever received ART before).,"The inclusion criteria specified treatment-naive patients and explicitly excluded treatment-experienced individuals, therefore sequencing was performed on samples from participants who had not previously received antiretroviral therapy."

Sequences were obtained from ART-experienced individuals with low-level viremia (viral load 200–1000 copies/mL) after at least 6 months of ART; the paper does not explicitly classify these individuals as virological failure cases.,"HIV-1 infected individuals were eligible for inclusion in this study if they have received ART for at least 6 months with HIV-1 viral load between 200 to 1000 copies/mL. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) efficiently reduces the morbidities and mortalities caused by HIV-1 infection and prevents the HIV epidemic. However, virologic failure (VF) occurs in some patients receiving ART experience, especially increases in those patients with intermittent or persistent low-level viremia (LLV).","The inclusion criteria specify ART-experienced patients with low-level viremia (200–1000 copies/mL), and while the Introduction discusses virologic failure conceptually, the manuscript does not state that sampled individuals met a formal virologic failure definition; therefore sequences are from ART-experienced LLV patients but VF status is not explicitly reported."
37546367,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No. This was a retrospective observational study using samples and data from routine care (National Free Antiretroviral Treatment Database).,Drug Resistance Profile Among HIV-1 Infections Experiencing ART with Low-Level Viral Load in Guangdong China During 2011--2022: A Retrospective Study. Epidemiological data for the patients ... were downloaded from the National Free Antiretroviral Treatment Database for Disease Control and Prevention.,"The title labels the work as a 'Retrospective Study' and Methods describe use of routine treatment database records rather than enrollment in a clinical trial, indicating this was observational and not a clinical trial."
37546367,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes. Inclusion criteria required individuals to have received ART for at least 6 months prior to sampling; sequences therefore derive from ART-experienced individuals.,"HIV-1 infected individuals were eligible for inclusion in this study if they have received ART for at least 6 months with HIV-1 viral load between 200 to 1000 copies/mL. In summary, our study provided an overview of the DR profile among ART-experienced LLVL in Guangdong, China, 2011--2022.","The Methods explicitly require prior ART exposure of at least six months for inclusion, and the paper repeatedly refers to 'ART-experienced' patients, confirming sequences came from individuals who had previously received antiretroviral drugs."
37546367,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs) (e.g., regimens described as 2NRTI+NNRTI or 2NRTI+PI).","Patients whose initial treatment regimen was 2NRTI+PI were less likely to be resistant to drugs than those whose initial treatment regimen was 2NRTI+NNRTI (2NRTI+PI versus 2NRTI+NNRTI: OR=0.584, 95% CI=0.432--0.790, P<0.001). The Stanford HIV dbprogram 9.4 ... was used to identify DRMs and infer resistance to antiretroviral drugs, including protease inhibitors (PI), nucleoside reverse- transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI).","The manuscript discusses initial regimens labeled as combinations of NRTIs with either NNRTIs or PIs and analyzes resistance to PI, NRTI and NNRTI classes, indicating that study participants had exposure to these drug classes prior to sequencing."
37546367,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"The manuscript references first-line and analyzed drugs including NRTIs (e.g., AZT, ABC, FTC, 3TC, TDF, D4T, DDI), NNRTIs (e.g., NVP, EFV, ETR, RPV, DOR) and PIs (e.g., NFV/r, DRV/r); first-line regimens mentioned include FTC, 3TC, EFV and NVP.","For NRTI, the resistance to seven NRTI ranged from 6.12% (127/2074) to 33.27% (690/2074). DR to AZT (6.12%) was significantly lower than that to ABC (33.27%), FTC (32.88%), 3TC (32.88%), TDF (14.75%), D4T (17.60%) and DDI (20.06%). For NNRTI, the resistance to five NNRTI ranged from 19.19% (398/2074) to 40.07% (831/2074), and the DR prevalence to NVP and EFV was 40.07% and 39.68%, respectively. For PI, the prevalence of DR to eight PI ranged from 0.87% (18/2074) to 3.23% (67/2074), with only the DR to NFV/r (3.23%) being more than 3.00% and that to DRV/r (0.87%) being only below 1.00%.","While the paper does not list each patient's exact regimen in full, it analyzes resistance to a defined panel of NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs (naming AZT, ABC, FTC, 3TC, TDF, D4T, DDI, NVP, EFV, ETR, RPV, DOR, NFV/r, DRV/r, etc.) and mentions first-line drugs (FTC/3TC/EFV/NVP), which indicates these drugs/classes were used by the cohort prior to sequencing."
37541705,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,No — the paper does not report patient-derived HIV sequences.,"Secondary outcome measures included ... antiretroviral resistance mutations at the time of virologic failure. All treatment-experienced participants, including the four with a known M184V mutation, maintained suppression (<200 copies per mL) through 24 weeks.","The manuscript lists antiretroviral resistance mutations as a planned secondary outcome and references known mutations (e.g., M184V), but nowhere in the Methods or Results are genotypic sequences, sequencing methods, or sequence data presented. The presence of a known mutation implies clinical resistance information was available for some participants, but explicit patient-derived sequence reporting is not provided in the text."
37541705,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No — the paper does not report any in vitro drug susceptibility data.,"Dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine concentrations were analyzed using validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods by the University of Alabama (appendix p. 4). Secondary outcome measures included virologic suppression, adherence, tolerability (palatability and acceptability), lipid profiles, CD4+ cell count and percentage, and AEs through 48 and 144 weeks of treatment; and antiretroviral resistance mutations at the time of virologic failure.","The Methods describe pharmacokinetic assays (LC-MS) for drug concentrations and clinical/virologic outcomes, but there is no description of any in vitro phenotypic susceptibility assays (e.g., phenotypic IC50/IC90 testing) or results.

37541705,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Not reported (no count of sequenced samples provided).,"Sixty-nine children were screened and 57 were enrolled and initiated study drug, composing the All-Treated population (Figure 1 and Table 2). Secondary outcome measures included virologic suppression, adherence, tolerability (palatability and acceptability), lipid profiles, CD4+ cell count and percentage, and AEs through 48 and 144 weeks of treatment; and antiretroviral resistance mutations at the time of virologic failure.","While the paper reports the number enrolled (57) and notes that resistance mutations were a secondary outcome, it does not state how many participants had sequences generated or how many genotypic resistance tests were performed. Therefore a specific count of sequenced individuals is not reported."
37541705,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Samples were obtained from participants recruited in Botswana, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States.","Participants were recruited from study sites in Botswana, South Africa, Thailand, and the U.S. Participants were enrolled from September 9, 2020 through June 28, 2021.","The Methods specify the countries where study participants were recruited; although the paper does not present sequence data, any samples (including those that would be used for resistance assessment) originated from participants at sites in these four countries."

Therefore no sequencing method is reported in the paper."
37541705,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,"Not reported; clinical virologic monitoring used plasma HIV-1 RNA, so any genotypic testing would likely have used plasma, but the paper does not explicitly state the sample type for sequencing.",HIV-1 RNA was monitored at all visits except week 1. Virologic failure was summarized and defined as two consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA values ≥200 copies per mL.,"The manuscript describes plasma HIV-1 RNA monitoring and defines virologic failure based on plasma viral load, which is the typical specimen for genotypic resistance testing.

37626789,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No. The paper does not report public deposition of sequences; raw data are available from the corresponding author on request.,"Since data analysis for other objectives is ongoing, the raw data can be obtained from the first corresponding author. The sequence was edited using a web-based ReCall (http://pssm.cfenet.ubc.ca/ , accessed on 11 April 2023).",The Data Availability Statement indicates raw data must be requested from the corresponding author; there is no mention of sequence deposition in GenBank or other public sequence repositories. Thus sequences were not reported as publicly available in the manuscript.
37626789,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,"Since data analysis for other objectives is ongoing, the raw data can be obtained from the first corresponding author. The manuscript does not list GenBank accession numbers or other public sequence identifiers.",The paper's Data Availability Statement instructs readers to contact the corresponding author for raw data and nowhere provides GenBank accession numbers or similar public identifiers; therefore no accession numbers were reported.
37626789,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Not reported (no explicit count provided for sequenced individuals).,"Children with initial viral load ≥1000 copies/mL at baseline testing were further followed for six months for a second round of VL re-testing... Then, children with VF (i.e., viral load ≥ 1000 copies/mL) were included for HIV drug resistance investigation. The study included 554 children from pediatric ART sites, but the paper does not state the exact number of children whose samples were sequenced.","Although the overall cohort size and the criteria for sequencing (children with virologic failure) are described, the manuscript does not provide an explicit numeric count of how many children met VF criteria and were genotyped/sequenced, so the exact number sequenced cannot be determined from the text."
37626789,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Ethiopia.,HIV-1 Disease Progression and Drug Resistance Mutations among Children on First-Line Antiretroviral Therapy in Ethiopia. A longitudinal study was conducted from 2017 to 2019 among HIV-infected children (<15 years old) on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART).,The title and study setting make clear that the study population and samples derive from Ethiopia; no other countries are mentioned as sample sources.
37626789,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Sequencing was performed during the study period (2017–2019), with viral load testing between March and September 2019; the samples used for genotyping thus derive from the 2017–2019 study window (likely 2019 samples).","A longitudinal study was conducted from 2017 to 2019 among HIV-infected children (<15 years old) on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). Viral load (VL) testing was conducted for children twice at 6-month intervals between March and September 2019 to determine virologic failure (VF). For children with VF, HIV-1 genotyping and sequencing was performed for the pol gene region using in-house assay.","The paper specifies the study timeframe as 2017–2019 and notes VL testing and follow-up rounds occurred between March and September 2019; sequencing was performed on samples from children with VF identified during that testing, so the sequenced samples were obtained during the 2017–2019 study period, most directly in 2019."
37626789,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No indication of cloning; the manuscript does not report cloning prior to sequencing.,"For children with VF, HIV-1 genotyping and sequencing was performed for the pol gene region using in-house assay validated at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Stanford HIVDB v9.0 algorithm was used for identification of drug resistance mutations. The pol gene region of the HIV-1 gene was sequenced by an ABI-3730 DNA genetic analyzer.","The Methods describe PCR amplification and sequencing by ABI-3730 but do not mention cloning of PCR products or clone-based sequencing. The absence of any statement about cloning implies direct PCR product sequencing (Sanger capillary), so no cloning was reported."
37626789,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,The pol gene region of HIV-1 was sequenced.,"For children with VF, HIV-1 genotyping and sequencing was performed for the pol gene region using in-house assay validated at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The pol gene region of the HIV-1 gene was sequenced by an ABI-3730 DNA genetic analyzer.","Both Abstract and Methods explicitly state sequencing targeted the pol gene region, so pol is the gene reported as sequenced."
37626789,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Sanger capillary sequencing using an ABI-3730 DNA genetic analyzer with an in-house PCR/sequencing assay validated by the Chinese CDC (sequences edited with ReCall).,"For children with VF, HIV-1 genotyping and sequencing was performed for the pol gene region using in-house assay validated at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The pol gene region of the HIV-1 gene was sequenced by an ABI-3730 DNA genetic analyzer. The sequence was edited using a web-based ReCall (http://pssm.cfenet.ubc.ca/ , accessed on 11 April 2023).","The manuscript names an in-house assay and explicitly states sequencing by an ABI-3730 analyzer (a capillary Sanger sequencing instrument) and post-sequencing editing with ReCall, indicating Sanger capillary sequencing workflow."
37626789,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma derived from EDTA whole blood samples.,"Whole blood was collected from children using two ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) coated test tubes of 3--5 mL each, and plasma was extracted using centrifugation at 2000 revolutions per minute (RPM). For children with VF, HIV-1 genotyping and sequencing was performed for the pol gene region.","The Methods describe collection of EDTA whole blood and extraction of plasma; sequencing is described in the same Methods section for children with VF, indicating plasma was the sample source for viral load testing and subsequent genotyping/sequencing."
37626789,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Yes. Sequencing/genotyping was performed specifically for children with virologic failure (two consecutive plasma viral loads ≥1000 copies/mL).,"Two consecutive viral load (VL) tests were conducted in 6-month intervals to assess virologic failure (VF). Then, children with VF (i.e., viral load ≥ 1000 copies/mL) were included for HIV drug resistance investigation.","The study workflow states that children who met the VF criteria were selected for HIVDR investigation and sequencing, so sequences were obtained from individuals with documented virologic failure while on ART."
37626789,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No. The study was a longitudinal observational cohort (part of a national cohort study), not a clinical trial.",A longitudinal study was conducted from 2017 to 2019 among HIV-infected children (<15 years old) on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). It was part of a national cohort study on HIV-1 treatment failure and acquired drug resistance among people taking ART at 63 health facilities in the country.,"The paper describes an observational longitudinal cohort design and does not describe randomization, intervention arms, or trial registration; thus participants were not enrolled in a clinical trial."
37626789,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"Yes. All sequenced individuals were children already on first-line ART for at least six months, so they had prior ARV exposure.","HIV-infected children taking first-line ART for at least six months were included in the study. For children with VF, HIV-1 genotyping and sequencing was performed for the pol gene region.","Inclusion criteria required participants to be on first-line ART for at least six months, and sequencing was performed on those with virologic failure among that group, indicating sequences came from ARV-experienced individuals."
37626789,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Primarily NRTIs and NNRTIs (first-line regimens); protease inhibitors (PIs) were infrequently used (mainly second-line) and thus occasionally present.,"A majority of the children (80%) were taking one of the three HAARTs regimens, which were Zidovudine (AZT) + Lamivudine(3TC) +Nevirapine (NVP), Stavudine(D4T) + Lamivudine(3TC) + Nevirapine (NVP), and Zidovudine (AZT) + Lamivudine(3TC) + Efavirenz (EFV). In the event of failure of the first-line regimen, the allowable second-line regimens are: (ddI or TDF) + ABC + (LPV/r or SQV/r or NFV or IND/r).","The listed first-line regimens combine NRTIs (e.g., AZT, 3TC, d4T, TDF, ABC) with NNRTIs (NVP, EFV), indicating participants primarily received NRTIs and NNRTIs; PIs are mentioned only in the context of second-line options and were infrequently used."
37626789,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Participants received drugs including Zidovudine (AZT), Lamivudine (3TC), Nevirapine (NVP), Stavudine (d4T), Efavirenz (EFV), Abacavir (ABC), Tenofovir (TDF), ddI (didanosine), and, rarely, protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), saquinavir/ritonavir (SQV/r), nelfinavir (NFV) or indinavir/ritonavir (IND/r).","A majority of the children (80%) were taking one of the three HAARTs regimens, which were Zidovudine (AZT) + Lamivudine(3TC) +Nevirapine (NVP) (35.9%), Stavudine(D4T) + Lamivudine(3TC) + Nevirapine (NVP) (30.3%), and Zidovudine (AZT) + Lamivudine(3TC) + Efavirenz (EFV) (14.0%). In the event of failure of the first-line regimen, the allowable second-line regimens are: (ddI or TDF) + ABC + (LPV/r or SQV/r or NFV or IND/r).",The Methods and Results list specific first-line and second-line drugs used in the cohort; those named drugs are therefore the ARVs to which patients had exposure prior to sequencing.
37573167,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,"This retrospective study included 1126 HIV-1 drug-experienced virologically suppressed subjects with an available HIV-DNA GRT over the period 2010-2021 performed for routine clinical practice in several reference centers in Italy. Sanger sequencing was performed as previously described [14,15].","The manuscript repeatedly describes performing HIV-DNA genotypic resistance testing (GRT) on patient-derived samples (1126 individuals) and specifies that Sanger sequencing was performed on those samples, which indicates that HIV sequences from patient samples were reported and analyzed."
37573167,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No.,"HIV-1 DNA was extracted from PBMCs by using a commercially available kit (QIAampDNAViral minikit; Qiagen), according to the product specifications. Sanger sequencing was performed as previously described [14,15].","The methods describe extraction of HIV-DNA and Sanger genotyping and subsequent genotypic interpretation using the Stanford algorithm (HIVdb). There is no mention of phenotypic or in vitro susceptibility assays (e.g., cell-culture phenotype testing), only genotypic resistance interpretation and calculation of genotypic susceptibility scores (GSS). Therefore no in vitro drug susceptibility data were reported."
37573167,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No (not reported).,"This retrospective study included 1126 HIV-1 drug-experienced virologically suppressed subjects with an available HIV-DNA GRT over the period 2010-2021 performed for routine clinical practice in several reference centers in Italy. Sanger sequencing was performed as previously described [14,15].","The paper describes the sequencing methods and the study cohort but does not provide GenBank accession numbers or any statement about depositing sequences in public repositories. Because no deposition or accession information is reported in the text, sequences were not shown to be made publicly available."
37573167,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,"This retrospective study included 1126 HIV-1 drug-experienced virologically suppressed subjects with an available HIV-DNA GRT over the period 2010-2021 performed for routine clinical practice in several reference centers in Italy.

Because no accession numbers are presented in the text or tables, there are no reported GenBank accession numbers for the sequences."
37573167,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,1126 individuals.,"This retrospective study included 1126 HIV-1 drug-experienced virologically suppressed subjects with an available HIV-DNA GRT over the period 2010-2021 performed for routine clinical practice in several reference centers in Italy. Among the 1126 individuals included, 396 (35.2%) harboured at least one MRM.","The paper explicitly states the cohort size as 1126 individuals who had HIV-DNA genotypic resistance tests and subsequent sequencing, so 1126 samples/individuals were included for sequencing analysis."
37573167,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Italy.,"This retrospective study included 1126 HIV-1 drug-experienced virologically suppressed subjects with an available HIV-DNA GRT over the period 2010-2021 performed for routine clinical practice in several reference centers in Italy. In the context of the increasing interest on PBMC genotyping, as far as we know, the present study is the largest available HIV-DNA resistance survey performed on HIV-1 infected virologically suppressed individuals followed for clinical routine.","The methods specify that the GRTs were performed in several reference centers in Italy for routine clinical practice, indicating the sequenced samples originated from Italy; no other countries are mentioned as sources."
37573167,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,2010–2021.,This retrospective study included 1126 HIV-1 drug-experienced virologically suppressed subjects with an available HIV-DNA GRT over the period 2010-2021 performed for routine clinical practice in several reference centers in Italy. From 2010 to 2021 no significant changes of resistance or APO-M were found.,"The study repeatedly indicates that the HIV-DNA GRT data and sequences cover the period 2010–2021, so the samples were obtained across those years."
37573167,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No — cloning is not reported.,"HIV-1 DNA was obtained from whole-blood (N=180) or lymphomonocytic cells (N=936) after separation from peripheral blood from HIV-1-infected patients with a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient, as described previously [13]. Sanger sequencing was performed as previously described [14,15].","The methods describe direct extraction of HIV-DNA from PBMCs and Sanger sequencing, but there is no mention of cloning of PCR products or molecular cloning prior to sequencing. The absence of any description of cloning implies samples were not cloned prior to Sanger sequencing (or it was not reported)."
37573167,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) — combined as PR/RT — and integrase.",A sequence was considered affected by APOBEC editing when at least one APOBEC related mutation (APO-M) or a stop codon (APO-stop) was detected in protease/reverse transcriptase (PR/RT) or integrase. The presence of the 18 APOBEC context drug resistance mutations (APO-DRM) according to Stanford HIVdb algorithm was also evaluated.,"The manuscript evaluates APOBEC editing and resistance in PR/RT and integrase sequences and reports resistance to PI, NRTI, NNRTI and INSTI classes, indicating sequencing covered protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase regions."
37573167,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Sanger sequencing.,"HIV-1 DNA was extracted from PBMCs by using a commercially available kit (QIAampDNAViral minikit; Qiagen), according to the product specifications. Sanger sequencing was performed as previously described [14,15].",The methods explicitly state that Sanger sequencing was used to generate the HIV sequences.
37573167,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,HIV-1 DNA extracted from whole blood or lymphomonocytic cells (PBMCs).,"HIV-1 DNA was obtained from whole-blood (N=180) or lymphomonocytic cells (N=936) after separation from peripheral blood from HIV-1-infected patients with a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient, as described previously [13]. HIV-1 DNA was extracted from PBMCs by using a commercially available kit (QIAampDNAViral minikit; Qiagen), according to the product specifications.","The text specifies that HIV-1 DNA was extracted from whole blood or PBMCs/lymphomonocytic cells, indicating the sequenced material was proviral HIV-1 DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells."
37573167,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,No — sequences were from virologically suppressed individuals.,We aimed at evaluating the temporal trend of drug-resistance and APOBEC editing from HIV-DNA genotypic resistance tests (GRT) in virologically suppressed individuals. This retrospective study included 1126 HIV-1 drug-experienced virologically suppressed subjects with an available HIV-DNA GRT over the period 2010-2021 performed for routine clinical practice in several reference centers in Italy.,The study population is explicitly described as virologically suppressed subjects; thus sequences were not obtained from individuals experiencing virological failure at the time of sampling.
37573167,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No — samples were from routine clinical practice (retrospective study).,"This retrospective study included 1126 HIV-1 drug-experienced virologically suppressed subjects with an available HIV-DNA GRT over the period 2010-2021 performed for routine clinical practice in several reference centers in Italy. All analyses were executed using the SPSS v.26.0 software pack-age for Windows (SPSS,Inc., Chicago, IL).",The study is described as retrospective and conducted on samples collected during routine clinical practice; there is no indication that patients were enrolled in a clinical trial.
37573167,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes.,"This retrospective study included 1126 HIV-1 drug-experienced virologically suppressed subjects with an available HIV-DNA GRT over the period 2010-2021 performed for routine clinical practice in several reference centers in Italy. At HIV-DNA GRT, individuals were under virological suppression for a median (IQR) of 3.7 (0.3-8.0) years, and were mainly under triple therapy (66.1%) based on PI, NNRTI or INSTI plus 2 NRTIs (Table 1). Around half of them (47.1%) achieved virological suppression under the last regimen and 44.3% had previously received a regimen containing an INSTI.","The cohort is explicitly described as 'drug-experienced' and details are provided about current and prior therapies (e.g., percentage previously receiving INSTI-containing regimens), indicating participants had prior ARV exposure."
37573167,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs, and INSTIs.","At HIV-DNA GRT, individuals were under virological suppression for a median (IQR) of 3.7 (0.3-8.0) years, and were mainly under triple therapy (66.1%) based on PI, NNRTI or INSTI plus 2 NRTIs (Table 1). Around half of them (47.1%) achieved virological suppression under the last regimen and 44.3% had previously received a regimen containing an INSTI.","The text names the major antiretroviral drug classes used in the cohort (protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, integrase strand transfer inhibitors, and nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors), indicating participants had exposure to these classes."
37573167,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Specific ARV drug names are not reported; only drug classes and regimen types are described.,"At HIV-DNA GRT, individuals were under virological suppression for a median (IQR) of 3.7 (0.3-8.0) years, and were mainly under triple therapy (66.1%) based on PI, NNRTI or INSTI plus 2 NRTIs (Table 1). Around half of them (47.1%) achieved virological suppression under the last regimen and 44.3% had previously received a regimen containing an INSTI.","While the manuscript reports the classes of drugs and proportions on current/prior regimen types (e.g., triple therapy, prior INSTI exposure), it does not list individual antiretroviral drug names (e.g., efavirenz, tenofovir, dolutegravir). Therefore specific drugs received by participants are not reported in the paper."
37574435,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,"Yes — the paper reports and uses archived HIV genotypic resistance data (resistance-associated mutations) from patient samples, but it does not present raw sequence data or newly generated sequencing reads in the manuscript.","We also collected the available reports of HIV genotypic resistance testing of included PWH. In our cohort, 70 of 79 (88.6%) included PWH had available genotypic resistance data prior to the switch to BIC/FTC/TAF or DTG-based antiretroviral regimens; and 32 of them (45.7%) had documented archived RAMs to NRTIs or INSTIs.","The methods and results explicitly state that the authors collected available reports of HIV genotypic resistance testing and report numbers of participants with archived resistance-associated mutations (RAMs). This indicates that HIV sequence-based genotypic resistance information from patient samples was used. However, the paper describes using existing resistance reports rather than presenting novel sequencing output or raw sequence files."
37574435,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No — the paper does not report in vitro phenotypic drug susceptibility testing results.,"We also collected the available reports of HIV genotypic resistance testing of included PWH. However, no genotypic resistance testing was performed for PWH included in our study after ART switch.",The manuscript describes collection and review of genotypic resistance reports (sequence-based RAMs) but contains no mention of in vitro phenotypic susceptibility assays or phenotypic IC50/EC50 data. The statement that no genotypic testing was performed after switch further indicates absence of additional laboratory susceptibility testing reported in the study.
37574435,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No — the paper does not indicate that HIV sequences or accessioned sequence data were made publicly available.,"We also collected the available reports of HIV genotypic resistance testing of included PWH. The manuscript provides counts and descriptions of archived RAMs (e.g., M184V/I, K65R, INSTI RAMs) but does not list sequence files or accession numbers.","Throughout the paper the authors report aggregated genotypic resistance findings and mutation frequencies but do not provide GenBank accession numbers, sequence alignments, or a data availability statement indicating deposition of sequences. Therefore no public sequence deposit is indicated."
37574435,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,We also collected the available reports of HIV genotypic resistance testing of included PWH. The manuscript provides no GenBank accession numbers or other sequence repository identifiers.,The paper summarizes archived resistance-associated mutations and proportions of participants with RAMs but does not include any GenBank accession numbers or links to deposited sequence data; therefore no accession numbers are reported.
37574435,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,70 individuals had available genotypic resistance data prior to switch (out of 79 included participants).,"In our cohort, 70 of 79 (88.6%) included PWH had available genotypic resistance data prior to the switch to BIC/FTC/TAF or DTG-based antiretroviral regimens. During the study period, we identified 79 PWH who met the criteria of viral rebound and switched to second-generation INSTI-containing regimens.","The study included 79 participants overall, and the authors explicitly state that 70 of these had available genotypic resistance reports prior to the regimen switch. That indicates 70 individuals had sequence-based genotypic resistance data available for review."
37574435,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Taiwan.,"This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted in the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). The study was supported by the Centers for Diseases Control, Taiwan (grant number: MOHW112-CDC-C-114-000103).",The study was performed at a single center (NTUH) in Taiwan and used the hospital's electronic medical database; therefore the patient samples and genotypic data originate from Taiwan.
37574435,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Patient care and data used in the study cover 1 January 2016 through 30 March 2022; archived genotypic resistance data were those available prior to switches occurring within that timeframe.,"PWH who were aged ≥20 years and received HIV care with at least 3 months of ART prescription between 1 January 2016 and 30 March 2022 were eligible for the study. In our cohort, 70 of 79 (88.6%) included PWH had available genotypic resistance data prior to the switch to BIC/FTC/TAF or DTG-based antiretroviral regimens.","The inclusion window for patient care and ART prescriptions is explicitly stated as 2016–2022. The archived genotypic reports reviewed were those available prior to switches that occurred during this study period, so the sequencing/genotypic data derive from that timeframe (or earlier archived testing) but no other specific years for sequencing are provided."
37574435,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not reported / No indication that samples were cloned prior to sequencing.,We also collected the available reports of HIV genotypic resistance testing of included PWH. The methods section describes retrieval of genotypic resistance reports and review of archived RAMs but does not describe cloning or cloning-based sequencing methods.,"The paper summarizes use of archived genotypic resistance reports but provides no methodological details about sequencing protocols (e.g., Sanger vs. next-generation, population vs. clonal sequencing) and specifically does not mention cloning prior to sequencing. Therefore cloning was not reported."
37574435,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,Regions corresponding to reverse transcriptase (NRTI-related RAMs) and integrase (INSTI-related RAMs) were reported; specific protease sequencing is not described.,"For PWH who had available genotypic resistance reports, their archived RAMs to NRTIs or INSTIs before the switch was reviewed and the genotypic resistance scores (GSSs) were determined using the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database. Of these 32 PWH, 93.8% had NRTI-related RAMs and 78.1% were known to have HIV-1 harboring M184V/I mutation before switch.","The manuscript reports NRTI-related resistance-associated mutations (which map to the reverse transcriptase gene) and INSTI-related RAMs (which map to the integrase gene). No explicit mention of protease or envelope sequencing is provided, so the reported sequenced regions are reverse transcriptase and integrase."
37574435,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not reported — the paper does not describe the sequencing methodology used in the genotypic resistance reports.,"We also collected the available reports of HIV genotypic resistance testing of included PWH. In Taiwan, genotypic resistance testing is performed before initiation of first-line therapy for the purpose of surveillance or at the time of virologic failure on an as-needed basis at several designated hospitals and Taiwan Centers for Disease Control.","Although the authors collected genotypic resistance reports, they do not provide details on the laboratory sequencing methods (e.g., Sanger, next-generation sequencing, primers, or platforms). Thus the exact sequencing method is not reported in the manuscript."
37574435,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,"Not explicitly reported; the paper refers to genotypic resistance reports and plasma HIV RNA load, so sequencing likely derived from plasma, but sample type is not specified.","For eligible PWH, available results of plasma HIV RNA load (PVL) were retrieved from the electronic medical record database (National Taiwan University Hospital-Integrated Medical Database; NTUH-IMD). We also collected the available reports of HIV genotypic resistance testing of included PWH.","The manuscript discusses plasma viral load testing and separately the collection of genotypic resistance reports, but it does not explicitly state the biological specimen used for sequencing. Genotypic resistance testing is commonly performed on plasma HIV RNA, so that is the likely source, but the paper does not explicitly specify the sample type."
37574435,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Yes — genotypic resistance data were collected for patients who experienced viral rebound (virologic failure) while on treatment prior to switching regimens.,We then screened these PWH to identify those who were receiving ART and had ever achieved viral suppression (defined as PVL <50 copies/mL) before developing viral rebound (defined as PVL >1000 copies/mL). We also collected the available reports of HIV genotypic resistance testing of included PWH.,"The cohort was defined by viral rebound during ART and the authors specifically reviewed archived genotypic resistance reports for these patients prior to regimen switch, indicating that sequences/genotypic data derive from individuals with virologic failure on treatment."
37574435,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — this was a single-center, retrospective cohort study, not a clinical trial.","This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted in the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). The study was based on data retrospectively extracted from electronic medical database of a university hospital and, therefore, the timing and reason of virologic failure could not be confirmed for all included PWH.","The manuscript explicitly describes the design as a retrospective cohort study using routine clinical data from a hospital database, rather than a prospective clinical trial; hence the patients were not participants in a clinical trial as part of this study."
37574435,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes — the study population consisted of antiretroviral-experienced people with HIV who had been receiving ART prior to the observed viral rebound and genotypic resistance data were from these treatment-experienced individuals.,"We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of PWH who had viral rebound with plasma HIV RNA >1000 copies/mL and were switched to either dolutegravir combined with 2 NRTIs or BIC/FTC/TAF. Most PWH (82.1%) in the DTG group switched from NNRTI-based ART to DTG-based regimens, while 75% of the PWH in the BIC group were receiving a first-generation INSTI-based ART before switch.",The cohort is explicitly described as antiretroviral-experienced patients experiencing viral rebound while on ART and many had prior exposure to NNRTI or first-generation INSTI regimens; the genotypic resistance reports reviewed therefore come from individuals with prior ARV exposure.
37574435,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Reported prior drug classes include nucleos(t)ide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and first-generation integrase strand-transfer inhibitors (INSTIs); some individuals may have had exposure to protease inhibitors (PIs) though PI exposure is not emphasized.","Most PWH (82.1%) in the DTG group switched from NNRTI-based ART to DTG-based regimens, while 75% of the PWH in the BIC group were receiving a first-generation INSTI-based ART before switch. In our cohort, 70 of 79 (88.6%) included PWH had available genotypic resistance data prior to the switch ... 93.8% had NRTI-related RAMs.","The paper states which backbone and prior core agent classes participants were on prior to switching (NNRTI-based or first-generation INSTI-based ART) and reports NRTI-related resistance mutations, indicating prior NRTI exposure. Protease inhibitor exposure is not a focus of the reported baseline regimens, though one later treatment change involved boosted darunavir."
37574435,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Specific drugs mentioned or implied include NRTIs such as tenofovir (resistance mutation K65R referenced) and lamivudine/emtricitabine (M184V/I associated), and first-generation INSTIs such as raltegravir and elvitegravir are referenced as prior exposures leading to INSTI RAMs; NNRTIs are mentioned as prior regimen class but specific NNRTI agents are not listed.","Of these 32 PWH, 93.8% had NRTI-related RAMs and 78.1% were known to have HIV-1 harboring M184V/I mutation before switch. Only two PWH in the DTG group had RAMs conferring high-level resistance to tenofovir, such as K65R. The preexisting RAMs to INSTIs before switch likely arose from previous exposure to first-generation INSTIs such as raltegravir and cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir.","The manuscript names specific mutations (M184V/I, K65R) that are linked to lamivudine/emtricitabine and tenofovir respectively, and it explicitly names first-generation INSTIs (raltegravir, elvitegravir) as prior exposures that likely generated INSTI RAMs. Specific NNRTI drugs are not enumerated in the text."
37632071,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,No — the paper does not report HIV sequences from patient samples.,"This retrospective cohort study was conducted at 4 (Rome, Treviso, Vicenza, and Venice) Italian Infectious Diseases Units and enrolled outpatients who were on successful ART and who had been switched to the drug combination BIC/FTC/TAF in the period 2019--2022. Only patients with plasma HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL at the testing before the switch were included in the study.","The Methods and Results describe clinical viral load measurements (plasma HIV RNA) and treatment-switch outcomes; there is no mention anywhere of sequencing methods, sequence data, or sequence analyses. Because the paper focuses on plasma HIV RNA testing and clinical outcomes and does not describe sequencing, it does not report HIV sequences from patient samples."
37632071,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No — the paper does not report in vitro drug susceptibility data.,"The study focused on clinical follow-up endpoints such as plasma HIV RNA undetectability at T6, T12, T18, and T24 and used statistical analyses (Kaplan--Meier, MANOVA, multilevel linear regression) to evaluate virologic response. The Materials and Methods and Results describe viral load monitoring and clinical variables but do not report phenotypic susceptibility testing or in vitro assays.","The manuscript details routine clinical viral-load monitoring and statistical analysis of virologic outcomes after switching regimens; there is no description of laboratory phenotypic assays, susceptibility testing, or results from in vitro drug susceptibility experiments. Therefore no in vitro drug susceptibility data are reported."
37632071,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No — no sequences were reported or made publicly available.,The raw data on demographics and clinical status of participants are protected and not available due to data privacy laws. The processed data are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.,"The Data Availability statement refers only to clinical/demographic data and does not mention sequence deposition or public sequence databases.

The processed data are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.,There is no section or statement listing GenBank accession numbers or other sequence identifiers; the Data Availability statement also does not mention sequence repositories. Hence no GenBank accession numbers are reported.
37632071,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Zero — no samples were obtained for HIV sequencing.,"A total of 329 PLWH had plasma HIV RNA that was undetectable or <50 copies/mL at T0: 98 were excluded because of lack of virological data of the 12 months before the switch; 32 patients had positive HBsAg; and 2 had positive HCV RNA at the switch. A total of 197 patients were included in the study, and they were immunocompetent (median CD4+ cell count was 677 cells/mm3).","While 197 patients were included for clinical viral-load monitoring and outcomes, the manuscript contains no description of sequencing any of their samples. Thus, although samples were collected for plasma HIV RNA testing, none were sequenced for the purposes of this paper."
37632071,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable — no sequenced samples; the study cohort was from Italy.,"This retrospective cohort study was conducted at 4 (Rome, Treviso, Vicenza, and Venice) Italian Infectious Diseases Units and enrolled outpatients who were on successful ART and who had been switched to the drug combination BIC/FTC/TAF in the period 2019--2022. The study reports results from these Italian centers.","Because no sequencing was performed, there are no sequenced-sample country origins to report. The patient cohort was recruited at Italian centers, so clinical samples (for viral-load testing) originated from Italy."
37632071,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable — no sequencing; study samples were collected in 2019--2022.,"This retrospective cohort study ... enrolled outpatients who were on successful ART and who had been switched to the drug combination BIC/FTC/TAF in the period 2019--2022. The follow-up study times were 6 (T6), 12 (T12), 18 (T18), and 24 (T24) months after the switch (T0).","Although the study period (sample collection and switches) spanned 2019--2022, the manuscript does not describe sequencing. Therefore there are no sequenced-sample years to report; the clinical samples referenced in the paper were obtained between 2019 and 2022."
37632071,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No — not applicable; no sequencing or cloning was reported.,The Materials and Methods describe inclusion criteria and plasma HIV RNA testing but do not describe molecular cloning or sequencing methods. The paper focuses on clinical viral loads and statistical analyses of virologic outcomes.,"There is no methodological description of cloning, PCR product cloning, or any sequencing workflow. Therefore samples were not cloned prior to sequencing in this study (no sequencing occurred)."
37632071,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,None — the paper does not report sequencing of any HIV genes.,"The manuscript describes plasma HIV RNA monitoring and clinical outcomes after switching to BIC/FTC/TAF and contains statistical analyses of virologic response. There is no mention of sequencing genes such as pol, gag, env, or others.","Because no sequencing is described, no HIV genes were sequenced or reported in this paper."
37632071,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not applicable — no sequencing method is reported.,"The Methods section details cohort selection, viral-load thresholds, and statistical analyses (Kaplan--Meier, MANOVA, multilevel regression) but does not describe any sequencing methods. The study focuses on plasma HIV RNA values and clinical follow-up.","There is no description of sequencing platforms, Sanger or NGS, or laboratory protocols; therefore no sequencing method was used or reported."
37632071,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Not applicable — no sequencing was performed; the study used plasma samples for HIV RNA (viral load) testing.,Only patients with plasma HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL at the testing before the switch were included in the study. Plasma HIV viremia and CD4+ cell count were evaluated at each follow-up study time.,"Although the study analyzed plasma (for HIV RNA/viral-load testing), there is no sequencing of those samples. Thus no sample types were sequenced; the biologic specimen used in the study was plasma for viral-load measurement."
37632071,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No — no sequences were obtained. Some participants had prior detectable viremia (≥50 copies/mL) in the year before switch, but no sequencing was performed.","In the previous 12 months, 67 (34%) patients had always undetectable HIV RNA, 99 (50.3%) had at least one test showing <50 copies/mL, and 31 (15.7%) had at least one test showing ≥ 50 copies/mL. A total of 197 patients were included in the study, and they were immunocompetent (median CD4+ cell count was 677 cells/mm3).","Although some individuals had episodes of detectable viremia (including ≥50 copies/mL) before the switch, the manuscript does not report sequencing of samples from these or any other participants. Therefore no sequences from individuals with virological failure are reported."
37632071,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — this was a retrospective cohort study of routine clinical practice, not a clinical trial.","This retrospective cohort study was conducted at 4 (Rome, Treviso, Vicenza, and Venice) Italian Infectious Diseases Units and enrolled outpatients who were on successful ART and who had been switched to the drug combination BIC/FTC/TAF in the period 2019--2022. The decision to start the new regimen was up to the treating physician according to the updated treatment guidelines and was performed as a routine clinical practice.","The paper explicitly describes the design as a retrospective cohort and states that switches were performed in routine clinical practice at the treating physician's discretion, indicating that participants were not enrolled in a prospective interventional clinical trial."
37632071,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"No — the paper does not report sequences. However, the participants were treatment-experienced and had received ARV drugs prior to switching.","A total of 197 patients were included in the study. Most of the 197 patients (122, 61.9%) were on a previous INSTI-based regimen. The influence of ongoing ART before the switch was evaluated in the 167 PLWH treated with 2NRTI+INSTI (n = 100), 2 NRTI+NNRTI (n = 37), and 2 NRTI+PI (n = 30) before the switch.","Although many participants were treatment-experienced (receiving various ARV regimens) the manuscript contains no sequencing data from these individuals. Thus the study does not report sequences from previously treated individuals, but it does describe their prior ARV exposure."
37632071,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not applicable for sequencing, but the participants had received NRTIs, INSTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs prior to the switch.","Most of the 197 patients (122, 61.9%) were on a previous INSTI-based regimen. The influence of ongoing ART before the switch was evaluated in the 167 PLWH treated with 2NRTI+INSTI (n = 100), 2 NRTI+NNRTI (n = 37), and 2 NRTI+PI (n = 30) before the switch.","The manuscript specifies prior regimen classes (NRTI backbone plus INSTI, NNRTI, or PI). Though no sequencing occurred, the documented prior drug classes include nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs)."
37632071,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"The paper does not list specific prior drugs for most participants; it reports regimen classes (e.g., 2NRTI+INSTI, 2NRTI+NNRTI, 2NRTI+PI). The switch regimen was bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF) and lamivudine is mentioned in discussion as an example in other contexts.","Most of the 197 patients (122, 61.9%) were on a previous INSTI-based regimen. The influence of ongoing ART before the switch was evaluated in the 167 PLWH treated with 2NRTI+INSTI (n = 100), 2 NRTI+NNRTI (n = 37), and 2 NRTI+PI (n = 30) before the switch. The study describes switching to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF).","Specific agent names for prior regimens are not provided in the Methods or Results (only regimen classes and combinations are given). The paper does specify the switch medication (BIC/FTC/TAF) and refers to lamivudine in the Discussion, but otherwise does not enumerate individual prior drugs; therefore specific prior drug names cannot be comprehensively listed from this paper."
37593123,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes — the paper reports HIV-1 pol gene sequences obtained from patient samples (ART-naïve HIV-positive individuals).,"Sequences of the HIV-1 pol gene region were obtained from ART-naïve HIV-positive individuals across 31 provincial-level administrative divisions between 2004 and 2022. A total of 57,902 HIV-1 pol gene region sequences that covered 31 PLADs made up the final dataset.","The Methods and Results explicitly state that HIV-1 pol gene sequences were obtained from ART-naïve HIV-positive individuals and quantify the final dataset as 57,902 sequences, indicating sequences from patient samples were reported."
37593123,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No — the paper did not report in vitro (phenotypic) drug susceptibility data; it used genotypic prediction via the Stanford HIVdb.,"To predict susceptibility to 12 antiretroviral drugs, the research utilized the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database. The study also notes that CRFs merit further exploration of their specific mutations or polymorphisms in relation to drug resistance, using phenotypic drug resistance methods.","The Methods describe use of the Stanford HIVdb for predicted susceptibility (a genotypic interpretation tool) and the Discussion explicitly suggests phenotypic methods as a future direction, indicating no phenotypic/in vitro susceptibility testing was performed in this study."
37593123,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,"Partly — the study used sequences that were publicly available in databases (China CDC holdings, Los Alamos, and GenBank annotations), but the paper does not present new accession numbers or explicitly state deposition of new sequences.","These sequences were procured from both the National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention, China CDC and the HIV sequence databases of the Los Alamos National Laboratory (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/, retrieved December 30, 2022).

However, the analyzed cohort comprised people with prior ARV exposure.","No new primary data were collected for this study. Overall, 94.6% (751,189) of clients had exposure to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC); 68.0% (539,773) had exposure to an NNRTI, 46.9% (372,382) to DTG, and 6.9% (54,918) to a protease-inhibitor (PI).","While the cohort clearly includes many individuals with prior ARV exposure as shown by the reported regimen exposures, the manuscript contains no sequencing data from these individuals. Thus, there are no HIV sequences from previously treated persons reported."
37649807,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not applicable for sequencing (no sequencing performed). The cohort had prior exposure to NRTIs, NNRTIs, INSTIs, and PIs.","Overall, 94.6% (751,189) of clients had exposure to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC); 68.0% (539,773) had exposure to an NNRTI, 46.9% (372,382) to DTG, and 6.9% (54,918) to a protease-inhibitor (PI).","Although sequencing was not performed, the manuscript lists the prior ART exposures of the cohort, which include nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (TDF with 3TC or FTC), non-nucleoside RTIs (NNRTIs), integrase strand transfer inhibitors (DTG/INSTI), and protease inhibitors (PIs)."

Reported drugs in the cohort include tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC), dolutegravir (DTG), NNRTIs (unspecified), and protease inhibitors (unspecified).","Overall, 94.6% (751,189) of clients had exposure to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC); 68.0% (539,773) had exposure to an NNRTI, 46.9% (372,382) to DTG, and 6.9% (54,918) to a protease-inhibitor (PI).","The paper provides counts and percentages of prior exposure to specific drugs (TDF, 3TC, FTC, DTG) and classes (NNRTI, PI). There is no further specification of which NNRTIs or PIs were used, and no sequencing was performed to link drug exposure to sequence data."
37585352,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes — the paper reports HIV-1 proviral sequences obtained from participant samples.,"We analysed near full-length HIV-1 pol sequences from proviral DNA for the presence of RPV-RAMs. In this analysis, we included a total of 5805 (95.5%) proviral sequences from Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP) participants, of which 1281 proviral DNA sequences were obtained from the treatment-naive individuals, and 4524 were from ART-experienced participants with HIV-1 VL ≤400 copies/mL.","The Methods and Results explicitly state that near full-length HIV-1 pol sequences were generated from proviral DNA and that 5805 proviral sequences from study participants were included, indicating these are sequences derived from patient samples."
37585352,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No — the paper does not report in vitro (phenotypic) drug susceptibility assays; it reports genotypic analysis and in silico resistance predictions.,"We analysed near full-length HIV-1 pol sequences from proviral DNA for the presence of RPV-RAMs, which were defined according to the 2022 IAS--USA drug resistance mutation list and Stanford HIV drug resistance database. The level of rilpivirine resistance was predicted according to the Stanford HIV DRM penalty scores and resistance interpretation.","The paper describes sequence-based identification of resistance-associated mutations and uses the Stanford penalty score (an in silico genotypic interpretation) to predict resistance; there is no mention of phenotypic or in vitro susceptibility testing (e.g., phenotypic assays) in the Methods or Results."
37585352,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,Partially — sequences are not deposited in a public repository within the paper but are available on request through the PANGEA consortium.,HIV-1 sequences are available on request through the PANGEA consortium ( www.pangea-hiv.org ). BCPP data are available at https://data.cdc.gov/Global-Health/Botswana-Combination-Prevention-Project-BCPP-Publi/qcw5-4m9q.,The Data availability statement indicates sequences can be obtained by request via PANGEA rather than being immediately publicly accessible via GenBank or similar; thus they are available but not directly publicly posted in the paper.
37585352,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported in the paper.,"HIV-1 sequences are available on request through the PANGEA consortium ( www.pangea-hiv.org ). All relevant data are within the paper and the Supplementary data , Figures and Tables.",The paper's Data availability section directs readers to request sequences from PANGEA and does not list any GenBank accession numbers or indicate deposition in GenBank; therefore no accession numbers are reported.
37585352,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,5805 individuals (one consensus sequence per participant).,"In this analysis, we included a total of 5805 (95.5%) proviral sequences from Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP) participants. A single consensus sequence represented the population of viral quasispecies per each participant.","The paper reports 5805 proviral sequences and states that a single consensus sequence represented each participant's viral population, indicating sequencing was performed for 5805 individuals."
37585352,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Botswana.,We included a total of 5805 proviral sequences from Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP) participants. This study presents the first data on the prevalence of RPV-RAMs among ART-naive and virologically suppressed PWH on ART in Botswana.,The study cohort is the Botswana Combination Prevention Project and the paper repeatedly refers to Botswana as the study setting; therefore all sequenced samples derive from Botswana participants.
37585352,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Samples were from the 2013–2018 period.,"Study participants were recruited from a large community HIV incidence trial described elsewhere that enrolled participants aged 16 to 64 years, followed for 30 months from 2013 to 2018. Samples used in this study were from 2013--18 before the widespread use of dolutegravir-based ART in Botswana.","The Methods describe participant follow-up from 2013 to 2018 and the Limitations explicitly state samples used were from 2013–18, indicating the sequencing samples were obtained during that timeframe."
37585352,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No — samples were not described as cloned; sequencing was performed on PCR amplicons by NGS and a single consensus was generated per participant.,A long-range HIV genotyping protocol was used to generate viral sequences and the first-round amplicon was subjected to the Illumina sequencing system. A single consensus sequence represented the population of viral quasispecies per each participant. Minor viral variants were not analysed.,"The Methods describe amplification and Illumina NGS of long-range amplicons and generation of a consensus sequence per participant; there is no mention of molecular cloning of amplicons prior to sequencing, so cloning was not performed or reported."
37585352,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,Near full-length HIV-1 pol gene sequences were generated and analysed.,We analysed near full-length HIV-1 pol sequences from proviral DNA for the presence of RPV-RAMs. HIV-1 proviral DNA sequences were generated using next-generation sequencing (NGS) as previously described elsewhere.,"The paper explicitly states that near full-length pol sequences were generated and used to identify rilpivirine resistance-associated mutations, indicating sequencing targeted the pol gene."
37585352,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Next-generation sequencing (Illumina platforms — MiSeq and HiSeq) of long-range PCR amplicons.,A long-range HIV genotyping protocol was used to generate viral sequences and the first-round amplicon was subjected to the Illumina sequencing system. The NGS was performed ... utilizing Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq platforms.,"The Methods specify a long-range genotyping PCR followed by Illumina NGS on MiSeq and HiSeq platforms, so sequencing was performed by next-generation sequencing using Illumina technology."
37585352,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Proviral DNA from participant samples (proviral DNA extracted from participants).,We analysed near full-length HIV-1 pol sequences from proviral DNA for the presence of RPV-RAMs. HIV-1 proviral DNA sequences were generated using next-generation sequencing (NGS) as previously described elsewhere.,"The Methods repeatedly indicate that proviral DNA was the nucleic acid source for sequencing, meaning proviral DNA (from participants' blood-derived cells) was sequenced."
37585352,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,No — sequences from individuals experiencing virological failure were not included.,"We did not include sequences for individuals experiencing virological failure since LA cabotegravir/rilpivirine is currently recommended only for virologically suppressed adults (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL), and is not currently recommended for people with virological failure. In this analysis, we included a total of 5805 proviral sequences ... 1281 from treatment-naive individuals, and 4524 were from ART-experienced participants with HIV-1 VL ≤400 copies/mL.","The Methods explicitly state that sequences from individuals with virological failure were excluded and that included ART-experienced participants were virally suppressed (VL ≤400), so no failing-regimen samples were analyzed."
37585352,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"Yes — participants were recruited from the Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP), a registered trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01965470).","Study participants were recruited from a large community HIV incidence trial described elsewhere that enrolled participants aged 16 to 64 years, followed for 30 months from 2013 to 2018. The BCPP study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) at the US CDC and the Botswana Health Research and Development Committee IRB and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01965470).","The paper states participants came from a community HIV incidence trial (BCPP) and provides the ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, confirming the cohort derived from a registered clinical trial."
37585352,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes — the dataset includes 4524 sequences from ART-experienced (virally suppressed) individuals in addition to 1281 from treatment-naive individuals.,"In this analysis, we included a total of 5805 proviral sequences ... of which 1281 proviral DNA sequences were obtained from the treatment-naive individuals, and 4524 were from ART-experienced participants with HIV-1 VL ≤400 copies/mL. The most common ART regimens used were efavirenz + emtricitabine + tenofovir (EFV/FTC/TDF) (n = 1792; 39.6%), lamivudine + nevirapine + zidovudine (3TC/NVP/ZDV) (n = 719; 15.9%) and lamivudine + efavirenz + zidovudine (3TC/EFV/ZDV) (n = 621; 13.7%).","The Results and Methods detail that a large portion of sequences came from ART-experienced, virally suppressed participants and list common ART regimens, indicating many sequenced individuals had prior ARV exposure."
37585352,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Primarily nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs); very few participants had received integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs).,"The most common ART regimens used were efavirenz + emtricitabine + tenofovir (EFV/FTC/TDF) (n = 1792; 39.6%), lamivudine + nevirapine + zidovudine (3TC/NVP/ZDV) (n = 719; 15.9%) and lamivudine + efavirenz + zidovudine (3TC/EFV/ZDV) (n = 621; 13.7%). The lack of analysis for HIV minority variants could be a limitation of our study as we could have underreported the prevalence of the RPV-RAMs. Our analysis only focused on RPV-RAMs and did not include cabotegravir RAMs (CAB-RAMs), as very few participants in the BCPP had ever been exposed to an INSTI-containing regimen and it is unlikely that there were any major CAB-RAMs in the study population.","The common regimens listed combine NRTIs (emtricitabine, tenofovir, lamivudine, zidovudine) with NNRTIs (efavirenz, nevirapine), indicating predominant exposure to NRTI and NNRTI classes; the paper explicitly notes very limited INSTI exposure."
37585352,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Common drugs included efavirenz (EFV), emtricitabine (FTC), tenofovir (TDF), lamivudine (3TC), nevirapine (NVP) and zidovudine (ZDV); very few participants had exposure to INSTI drugs.","The most common ART regimens used were efavirenz + emtricitabine + tenofovir (EFV/FTC/TDF) (n = 1792; 39.6%), lamivudine + nevirapine + zidovudine (3TC/NVP/ZDV) (n = 719; 15.9%) and lamivudine + efavirenz + zidovudine (3TC/EFV/ZDV) (n = 621; 13.7%). Our analysis only focused on RPV-RAMs and did not include cabotegravir RAMs (CAB-RAMs), as very few participants in the BCPP had ever been exposed to an INSTI-containing regimen and it is unlikely that there were any major CAB-RAMs in the study population.","The Results explicitly list the most common regimens and component drugs (EFV, FTC, TDF, 3TC, NVP, ZDV); the Limitations note minimal INSTI exposure, so those specific drugs were the primary ARVs received before sequencing."
37662576,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,No — the paper does not report HIV sequences from patient samples; it uses protein structures from the PDB and molecular dynamics simulations.,Protein structures of WT and mutant HIV-1 protease bound and unbound to drug inhibitors were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Comparative analyses of protein dynamic simulations of darunavir-bound WT HIV-1 protease (PDB: 6DGX ) and an unbound apo form of WT HIV-1 protease (PDB: 2PC0 ) show strong dampening of the key functional sight Ile50 on both chains A and B of the darunavir-bound dimer.,"The Methods explicitly state that the study obtained protein structures from the PDB and performed molecular dynamics simulations; there is no description of obtaining viral sequences from patient samples or performing sequencing experiments. All results and figures refer to PDB structures and MD comparisons rather than nucleotide or patient-derived sequence data, so the paper does not report HIV sequences from patient samples."
37662576,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No — the paper does not present in vitro drug susceptibility assays; it reports computational molecular dynamics analyses of protease structures and cites resistance levels from the literature.,"For each MD comparison, large replicate sets of accelerated MD simulations were prepared and then conducted using the particle mesh Ewald method implemented on A100 and V100 NVIDIA graphical processor units by pmemd.cuda running Amber20. Compared with WT HIV-1 protease, MDR769 has about 4.3-fold drug resistance against lopinavir (46).","The Methods and Results describe only computational MD simulations and analyses of PDB structures. The statement about MDR769's 4.3-fold resistance is a literature citation rather than an in vitro susceptibility experiment performed in this study. There is no description of cell-based or biochemical susceptibility assays conducted by the authors, so no new in vitro drug susceptibility data are reported."
37662576,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,"No — the paper does not report depositing sequences (e.g., GenBank accessions); it references PDB entries and provides a GitHub link for code.","Protein structures of WT and mutant HIV-1 protease bound and unbound to drug inhibitors were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The code for our DROIDS 4.0 pipeline is available at our GitHub web landing: https://gbabbitt.github.io/DROIDS-4.0-comparativeprotein-dynamics/ , which is also available at our GitHub repository https://github.com/gbabbitt/DROIDS-4.0-comparative-protein-dynamics .","The manuscript lists PDB identifiers for structures used and supplies a GitHub link for software, but it contains no statements about depositing nucleotide or protein sequences to public sequence repositories (e.g., GenBank) as new data from patient samples. Therefore, no new sequences were made publicly available by this paper."

For each MD comparison, large replicate sets of accelerated MD simulations were prepared and then conducted using ... Amber20.","The study design is computational and structural, using existing PDB entries and molecular dynamics simulations rather than collecting samples from individuals. There is no mention of enrolling participants, collecting clinical specimens, or sequencing patient-derived viruses, so no individuals had samples obtained for sequencing as part of this work."
37662576,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Not applicable — no patient or sequencing samples were obtained, so no countries are reported.",Protein structures of WT and mutant HIV-1 protease bound and unbound to drug inhibitors were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The paper discusses comparative MD simulations and PDB structures but does not describe collection of sequences from particular locations or countries.,"Because the study did not generate or report sequences from biological samples, there are no associated geographic origins or country metadata to report."
37662576,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable — the study does not report sequencing of samples and therefore provides no sampling years.,Protein structures of WT and mutant HIV-1 protease bound and unbound to drug inhibitors were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The manuscript focuses on MD simulations using existing PDB structures and does not report dates of sample collection or sequencing.,"No patient-derived sequencing was performed or reported, so there are no sample collection years to extract from the paper."

37662576,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,None — the paper did not perform sequencing; it studies the HIV-1 protease protein (the protease region of pol) using PDB structures.,"Protein structures of WT and mutant HIV-1 protease bound and unbound to drug inhibitors were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The HIV-1 protease is described repeatedly (e.g., ""HIV-1 protease is a homodimeric aspartyl protease enzyme"" and discussions focus on protease residues such as Ile50 and Asp25).","Although the biological focus is the protease (the protease gene/product), the paper does not report sequencing of HIV genes; instead it analyzes protease structures from PDB entries. Therefore no genes were sequenced in this work, but the protease (PR) region is the protein under study."
37662576,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not applicable — no sequencing was performed; the primary methods used were structural data retrieval from the PDB and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (accelerated MD with Amber20).,"Protein structures of WT and mutant HIV-1 protease bound and unbound to drug inhibitors were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). For each MD comparison, large replicate sets of accelerated MD simulations were prepared and then conducted using the particle mesh Ewald method implemented on A100 and V100 NVIDIA graphical processor units by pmemd.cuda running Amber20.","The Methods section details MD simulation protocols and use of PDB structural inputs; there is no description of sequencing methodologies (e.g., Sanger or NGS). Thus sequencing methods are not applicable to this study."
37662576,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Not applicable — no biological samples were sequenced; the study used protein structures from the PDB (protease crystal structures) as inputs to computational simulations.,"Protein structures of WT and mutant HIV-1 protease bound and unbound to drug inhibitors were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). After downloading the structures from the PDB database, any crystallographic reflections, ions, and other solvents used in the crystallization process were removed.","The text indicates the authors worked with deposited crystallographic protein structures rather than sequencing biological samples, so there are no sequenced sample types to report."
37662576,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No — the paper does not report sequences from individuals, including those with virological failure; it analyzes PDB structures and known resistance variants computationally.",Protein structures of WT and mutant HIV-1 protease bound and unbound to drug inhibitors were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Comparative analyses of protein dynamic simulations of darunavir-bound drug-resistant mutant HIV-1 protease (PDB: 6OPV ) and an unbound apo form of WT HIV-1 protease (PDB: 2PC0 ) show strong significant and symmetric amplification of atom motion at the key functional site Ile50 on both chains A and B of the darunavir-bound dimer.,"Although the authors analyze structures of drug-resistant protease variants (from PDB), they do not report obtaining viral sequences from patients experiencing virological failure. The resistance variants are studied as structural entries rather than as newly sequenced patient-derived isolates in this work."
37662576,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,Not applicable — there were no patients in this study; it is a computational/structural analysis using PDB data.,"Protein structures of WT and mutant HIV-1 protease bound and unbound to drug inhibitors were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). For each MD comparison, large replicate sets of accelerated MD simulations were prepared and then conducted using ... Amber20.",The manuscript describes computational simulations of protease structures with no enrollment of human subjects or clinical trial conduct. Therefore there were no patients and no clinical trial context in this study.
37662576,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No — the paper does not report sequences from individuals with prior ARV exposure; it analyzes structural protease variants from PDB and discusses clinical drugs in the literature context.,"Protein structures of WT and mutant HIV-1 protease bound and unbound to drug inhibitors were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Darunavir is one such US FDA-approved protease inhibitor with high binding affinity and can be effective against strains where resistance to other inhibitors has developed (41, 42).","The study uses PDB structures of wild-type and mutant proteases and performs MD simulations; there is no description of sequencing viruses from patients with prior ARV treatment. Mentions of ARV drugs refer to drugs studied conceptually or via structural complexes (e.g., darunavir, lopinavir), not to patient treatment histories linked to sequences in this paper."
37662576,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not applicable — there were no individuals or sequencing in the study; therefore no drug class exposure of sampled individuals is reported.,"Protein structures of WT and mutant HIV-1 protease bound and unbound to drug inhibitors were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We employed our comparative dynamics framework to investigate binding and behavior of two PIs in current clinical use: darunavir, which was approved in 2006, and lopinavir, approved in 2000.","Although the paper discusses protease inhibitors (a drug class) and models protease bound to those inhibitors, it does not describe samples from individuals or their prior ARV exposures; thus no information on drug classes received by study individuals exists."
37662576,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not applicable — no individuals were sampled or sequenced in this study; therefore no drugs received by individuals are reported.

Sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems 3500 genetic analyzer (HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan) and sequence assembly and editing with SeqScape v2.7 or Recall v2.28.","The Methods describe RT-PCR and nested PCR amplification of viral RNA followed by purification and direct sequencing on a capillary sequencer. There is no mention of molecular cloning (e.g., cloning into vectors, colony picking) prior to sequencing, which indicates that cloning was not performed."
37632026,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"The HIV-1 pol gene, specifically the protease and reverse-transcriptase regions.","Using an in-house protocol and two-step polymerase chain reaction-PCR (RT-PCR and Nested-PCR), HIV-1 pol-gene (protease and reverse-transcriptase regions) was then amplified (~1600 base pairs). All edited sequences were interpreted using Stanford HIVdb v.9.4. to identify major DRMs and potentially active medications.","The Methods explicitly state amplification of the pol gene covering protease and reverse transcriptase regions, which are the regions sequenced and interpreted for drug resistance mutations."
37632026,10,What method was used for sequencing?,PCR amplification (RT-PCR and nested PCR) followed by Sanger sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 3500 genetic analyzer.,"Using an in-house protocol and two-step polymerase chain reaction-PCR (RT-PCR and Nested-PCR), HIV-1 pol-gene (protease and reverse-transcriptase regions) was then amplified (~1600 base pairs). Sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems 3500 genetic analyzer (HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan) and sequence assembly and editing with SeqScape v2.7 or Recall v2.28.","The Methods describe two-step RT-PCR/Nested-PCR amplification of HIV RNA and then sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 3500 instrument (a capillary Sanger sequencer), indicating Sanger sequencing following PCR amplification."
37632026,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma samples (viral RNA extracted from patient plasma).,"First, 10 mL of blood was drawn from treatment-failing patients who presented for GRT at CIRCB. Plasma samples were then separated from whole blood and stored between −20 °C to −80 °C when samples were not to be analysed immediately. Following this step, 140 µL of plasma was retained for HIV-1 RNA extraction following the QIAGEN protocol (QIAamp DNA Minikit; QIAGEN, Courtaboeuf, France).","The Methods detail blood collection and separation of plasma, followed by extraction of viral RNA from plasma for subsequent PCR and sequencing, establishing that plasma-derived viral RNA was the material sequenced."
37632026,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Yes — all participants were experiencing virological failure on first- or second-line ART.,"A laboratory-based study with 759 patients (≥15 years) experiencing virological failure was carried out at the Chantal Biya International Reference Centre (CIRCB), Yaoundé, Cameroon. Inclusion criteria: We included all participants aged ≥ 15 years, failing virologically (two consecutive plasma viral loads ≥ 1000 copies/mL after intensified adherence counselling) on a standard first- or second-line ART regimen after being treated for at least six months.","The inclusion criteria and study population description state that enrolled participants were failing virologically on ART (first- or second-line), so the sequences derive from individuals with virological failure while on treatment."
37632026,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — this was a laboratory-based cross-sectional and analytical study, not a clinical trial.","We carried out a laboratory-based cross-sectional and analytical study from November 2011 to August 2019 with adults (≥15 years) who had failed first- and second-line ART, received for genotypic resistance testing (GRT) at the Chantal Biya International Reference Centre (CIRCB) ...

We sequenced and analyzed 1,161 samples obtained from 1,393 HIV-1 infected individuals in our research.","The study enrolled 1,393 ART-naïve individuals, and the Results state that sequencing was successful for 1,161 samples; therefore 1,161 individuals had sequences obtained and analyzed."
37674678,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,"China (samples collected in Nanjing, China).","Transmitted drug resistance and transmission clusters among ART-naïve HIV-1-infected individuals from 2019 to 2021 in Nanjing, China. Participants were enrolled at the voluntary counseling testing clinics (VCT) in Nanjing.","The study title and Methods specify the study location as Nanjing, China, and participants were enrolled at VCT clinics in Nanjing, indicating samples originated from China."
37674678,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Samples were obtained during 2019–2021 (enrollment between January 2019 and late 2021).,"A total of 1,393 ART-naïve individuals newly diagnosed with HIV-1 were enrolled between January 1, 2019 and November 31, 2021. The Abstract says participants were newly diagnosed with HIV-1 and had not received ART between January 2019 and December 2021.","Both the Abstract and Methods define the study period as spanning 2019 to 2021 (Methods gives specific enrollment dates within that period), so sequenced samples derive from 2019–2021."
37674678,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No. PCR products were directly sequenced after nested PCR; no cloning step is described.,"The target fragment of 1,059 bp in the pol gene ... was amplified using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were sent to Sangon Biotechnology Co., Ltd. for automatic DNA sequencing using ABI 3730XL.","The Methods describe nested RT-PCR amplification followed by direct automatic sequencing; there is no mention of molecular cloning into vectors or cloning-based sequencing, so samples were not cloned prior to sequencing."
37674678,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"A fragment of the pol gene was sequenced (HXB2 coordinates 2253–3312), covering protease and reverse transcriptase regions used for PI, NRTI and NNRTI resistance analysis.","The target fragment of 1,059 bp in the pol gene (HXB2:2253--3,312) was amplified using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

37674678,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma samples (viral RNA extracted from 200 μl plasma).,"Within 12 h after blood collection, plasma was isolated and kept at −80°C until analysis. Viral RNA was extracted from 200 μl plasma samples using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).","The Methods state viral RNA was extracted from patient plasma, indicating that plasma specimens were the sequenced sample type."
37674678,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No. All participants were ART-naïve with no history of antiretroviral therapy, so sequences were not from individuals with virological failure on treatment.","A total of 1,393 participants who were newly diagnosed with HIV-1 and had not received ART between January 2019 and December 2021 were enrolled in this study. Each patient met the following criteria: ... (3) No history of ART.","The inclusion criteria required no prior ART, so none of the sequenced samples came from patients experiencing virological failure while on treatment."
37674678,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No. Patients were recruited from voluntary counseling and testing clinics and the study was an observational surveillance study, not a clinical trial.",Participants were enrolled at the voluntary counseling testing clinics (VCT) in Nanjing. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nanjing Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Approval ID: PJ2020-A001-03).,"The Methods describe enrollment at VCT clinics and ethical approval for observational research; there is no mention of a clinical trial design, interventions, randomization, or trial registration, indicating it was not a clinical trial."
37674678,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No. The study specifically enrolled ART-naïve individuals with no history of antiretroviral therapy.,"A total of 1,393 participants who were newly diagnosed with HIV-1 and had not received ART between January 2019 and December 2021 were enrolled in this study. Each patient met the following criteria: (3) No history of ART.","The inclusion criteria explicitly exclude individuals with prior ART exposure, so sequences are from individuals who had not previously received ARV drugs."
37674678,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,None — participants were ART-naïve and had not received any antiretroviral drug classes prior to sampling.,"Each patient met the following criteria: (3) No history of ART. TDR was detected among ART-naïve individuals, and sequences classified as low-, intermediate-, or high-level resistance were designated as drug resistance according to the WHO drug resistance report.","Because inclusion required no prior ART, participants did not receive any antiretroviral drug classes before sequencing; references to drug classes in the paper relate to interpreted resistance, not prior treatment of the sequenced individuals."
37674678,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,None — study participants had not received any specific antiretroviral drugs prior to sample collection.,"Each patient met the following criteria: (3) No history of ART. A total of 1,393 participants who were newly diagnosed with HIV-1 and had not received ART between January 2019 and December 2021 were enrolled in this study.","The manuscript explicitly states participants had no history of ART, so no individual had received specific antiretroviral drugs before sequencing; mentions of specific drugs (e.g., EFV, NVP) refer to resistance classifications, not prior exposure in study participants."
37716367,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,No — this paper is a reporting guideline and does not present primary HIV sequence data from patient samples.,We describe the rationale and recommended use of a checklist of items that should be included in reports of HIVDR incidence or prevalence. The choice of articles from which the examples were drawn is arbitrary and does not imply that the paper reported all the items on the checklist.,The manuscript is a methodological/reporting guideline (CEDRIC-HIV) rather than a primary research study. It repeatedly frames itself as guidance and provides examples drawn from other studies; the explicit sentence saying that example articles are chosen arbitrarily and that this does not imply the paper reported all items indicates the paper itself does not present original sequence data.
37716367,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No — the paper does not report in vitro drug susceptibility data.,This checklist and accompanying articles were reviewed by the writing team and validated externally. The choice of articles from which the examples were drawn is arbitrary and does not imply that the paper reported all the items on the checklist.,The article is focused on developing and explaining a reporting checklist for HIVDR studies and uses examples from other papers; it does not present laboratory in vitro susceptibility experiments or results itself. The text's framing as guidance and the remark about examples drawn from other studies support that no primary susceptibility data are reported here.
37716367,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,"No — there are no sequences reported in this paper, so none were made publicly available.","The authors should specify if the nucleotide sequence data are publicly available, available upon request or not, and report the repository where they are stored, the digital object identifier (DOI;if available) and the procedures for access, where applicable. The choice of articles from which the examples were drawn is arbitrary and does not imply that the paper reported all the items on the checklist.",The manuscript recommends authors report sequence availability for their studies but does not itself present sequence data or accession information. The guidance text and the earlier statement that examples are drawn from other papers indicate this article did not deposit any sequences.
37716367,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported — this paper does not list any GenBank accession numbers.,They should also report the Genbank Accession Numbers for the nucleotide sequences used. The choice of articles from which the examples were drawn is arbitrary and does not imply that the paper reported all the items on the checklist.,"While the guideline instructs authors to report GenBank accession numbers and provides examples from other studies that do so, the guideline itself contains no accession numbers. The absence of any accession entries in the text and the framing as guidance confirms none are reported."
37716367,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Not applicable / none — the paper is a guideline and does not report participants or sequencing from individuals.,This reporting checklist is meant to support transparent and replicable reporting of HIV drug resistance data from any study design. The choice of articles from which the examples were drawn is arbitrary and does not imply that the paper reported all the items on the checklist.,The document is methodological and provides examples from other studies; it does not describe its own cohort or number of individuals sequenced. Therefore there is no number of sampled individuals to report from this paper.
37716367,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable / none — the paper does not present sequenced samples from any country.,The checklist and accompanying articles were reviewed by the writing team and validated externally. The choice of articles from which the examples were drawn is arbitrary and does not imply that the paper reported all the items on the checklist.,"Although the guideline cites or uses examples from studies conducted in various settings (e.g., examples mention Aruba, Soweto, Sweden, Taiwan), those are illustrative examples from other papers. The guideline itself does not report original sequenced samples from any country."
37716367,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable / none — the paper does not report sequenced samples or collection years.,"The choice of articles from which the examples were drawn is arbitrary and does not imply that the paper reported all the items on the checklist. Example: In this study, the authors clearly outline the type of drug resistance, the population included in the study and the location of the study: ""Transmitted drug resistance in recently infected HIV-positive Individuals from four urban locations across Asia (2007--2010) -- TASER-S"".","The guideline includes illustrative examples from other papers that mention specific collection years (e.g., 2007--2010) but does not itself present data with sample collection years. Thus there are no collection years to report for this paper."
37716367,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not reported / not applicable — the paper does not present laboratory methods applied to original samples and does not state that samples were cloned.,"The type of the specimen used for drug resistance should be reported (plasma or dried blood spots [DBS]). If NGS was used, it is critical to report the mutation-detection threshold, as different thresholds would result in different estimates of prevalence.",The manuscript outlines items that studies should report about laboratory methods (including specimen type and NGS thresholds) but does not describe specific laboratory processing for samples in a primary study. There is no mention that samples were cloned prior to sequencing in this guideline.
37716367,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,Not applicable / none reported — the paper does not report sequencing of particular HIV genes.,The Swedish InfCareHIV database includes demographic and clinical information as well as genotyping results and the viral pol sequences obtained in routine clinical care from more than 99% of Swedish residents with known HIV infection. They should also report the Genbank Accession Numbers for the nucleotide sequences used.,The guideline uses examples referring to pol sequences from other studies/databases but itself does not present sequencing results or state which genes were sequenced. Thus no genes are reported in this paper.
37716367,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not applicable / not reported — the paper does not apply or report a sequencing method for primary data.,"The methods used for viral load testing, particularly the lower limit of detection, especially since virus must be detected for genotyping. If NGS was used, it is critical to report the mutation-detection threshold, as different thresholds would result in different estimates of prevalence.",The manuscript discusses what laboratory methods should be reported (including viral load testing and NGS considerations) but does not describe conducting sequencing itself. Therefore no sequencing method is reported for this paper.
37716367,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Not applicable / not reported — the paper does not present sequencing of samples.,"The type of the specimen used for drug resistance should be reported (plasma or dried blood spots [DBS]). Plasma-based samples provide information on the HIV drug resistance profile of the population of replicating viruses while DBS specimens may also include archival HIV DNA in latent cell reservoirs, potentially creating discrepancies in the estimates observed.",The guideline instructs authors to report specimen type (plasma or DBS) but does not itself sequence samples or state which specimen type was used. Thus no specimen type is reported for this paper.
37716367,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Not applicable / no — the paper does not present sequence data from individuals on treatment or with virological failure.,This reporting checklist is meant to support transparent and replicable reporting of HIV drug resistance data from any study design. The choice of articles from which the examples were drawn is arbitrary and does not imply that the paper reported all the items on the checklist.,The document is a reporting guideline and uses examples from other studies; it does not include primary participant-level clinical or virological data indicating treatment failure. Therefore no sequences from individuals with virological failure are reported here.
37716367,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No — this paper is a guideline and not a clinical trial report.,"This reporting checklist is meant to support transparent and replicable reporting of HIV drug resistance data from any study design. As such it was not developed as an extension to any of the popular design-based reporting guidelines like STROBE or CONSORT, but rather as a topic-based reporting guideline.",The manuscript is methodological guidance (CEDRIC-HIV) rather than a report of a clinical trial. The explicit statement that it is not an extension to CONSORT (the trial reporting guideline) supports that it does not involve trial participants.
37716367,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No — the paper does not report sequences from treated individuals.,"Authors should provide contextual information that will facilitate interpretation of the results. For example, the ARV drug classes (or regimens) commonly used in the region the study was conducted, previous studies of HIVDR in that population and any relevant changes over time.",The guideline recommends reporting prior ARV exposures in studies but itself does not present participant-level exposure or sequence data. Therefore it does not report sequences from individuals with prior ARV treatment.
37716367,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not applicable / not reported — the paper does not contain a study cohort and so lists no drug classes received by study participants.,"Following World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, a standard regimen consisting of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a non-NRTI (NNRTI) has been rolled out as initial cART. The authors should provide information on exposures to antiretroviral drugs (including ART, PrEP, Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission [PMTCT]) ... for each class (NNRTI, NRTI, PI, INSTI).","The text mentions common ARV classes (NRTI, NNRTI, PI, INSTI) as examples of what studies should report, but this manuscript itself does not report participant treatment histories. Therefore there are no reported drug classes received by individuals in this paper."
37716367,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not applicable / not reported — the paper does not report individual-level drug exposures or specific drugs received.,"Of 11 patients harboring NNRTIs mutations, all of them were forecasted to have intermediate or high-level resistance to Efavirenz (EFV, 2.0%) and Nevirapine (NVP, 2.0%), followed by Rilpivirine (RPV, 1.1%) and Etravirine (ETR, 1.1%). They should also report the Genbank Accession Numbers for the nucleotide sequences used.","The guideline includes illustrative examples from other studies that mention specific drugs (e.g., EFV, NVP, RPV, ETR) but does not present its own data on which drugs participants received. Thus there are no reported specific drugs received by individuals in this paper."
37701387,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes — the paper reports baseline genotypic data (viral mutations) from patient samples (Rainbow study participants).,"There were no changes in ART based on examination of the baseline genotype (no NRTI mutations, only 3 accessory INSTI mutations [E157Q, G163K, L74I]; no INSTI major mutations). A total of 30 patients (Table 1) were enrolled: 16% female, 90% white, median age 45 years (38--58)...","The text explicitly states that a baseline genotype was examined and lists specific drug-resistance-associated mutations (NRTI and INSTI-associated changes) found, which indicates that HIV genotypic sequence data were obtained from patient samples (the Rainbow study participants)."
37701387,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No — the paper does not report in vitro phenotypic drug susceptibility data.,"There were no changes in ART based on examination of the baseline genotype (no NRTI mutations, only 3 accessory INSTI mutations [E157Q, G163K, L74I]; no INSTI major mutations). The LAPTOP Study is currently still ongoing and the results were not yet available.","The paper describes genotypic (mutation) information but contains no mention of in vitro phenotypic susceptibility assays or results (no phenotypic IC50/IC90 data or described susceptibility testing methods), so no in vitro drug susceptibility data are reported."
37701387,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No — the paper does not report that sequences were deposited in public repositories.,"There were no changes in ART based on examination of the baseline genotype (no NRTI mutations, only 3 accessory INSTI mutations [E157Q, G163K, L74I]; no INSTI major mutations). The LAPTOP Study is currently still ongoing and the results were not yet available.","Although genotypic results are described, the manuscript provides no statement about deposition of sequences (for example, no GenBank accession numbers or data availability statement). Therefore, sequences do not appear to have been made publicly available according to the text."
37701387,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,"There were no changes in ART based on examination of the baseline genotype (no NRTI mutations, only 3 accessory INSTI mutations [E157Q, G163K, L74I]; no INSTI major mutations). The LAPTOP Study is currently still ongoing and the results were not yet available.",The paper lists genotype findings but does not provide any GenBank accession numbers or other sequence repository identifiers; therefore no accession numbers are reported.
37701387,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,30 individuals (Rainbow study).,"Rainbow was a pilot, single-center, single-arm, prospective, phase IV, clinical trial conducted in a tertiary care Italian hospital from the 1st of May 2020 to the 31st of December 2021. 30 ART-naive participants (Table 1), presenting at HIV-1 diagnosis with an advanced disease, were enrolled in the study.","The Rainbow study enrolled 30 ART‑naive participants and the text refers to examination of baseline genotype for these participants, indicating that sequencing/genotypic testing was performed on samples from these 30 individuals."

37701387,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Regions associated with NRTI and INSTI resistance — i.e., reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase sequences were assessed.","No NRTI mutations, only 3 accessory INSTI mutations [E157Q, G163K, L74I]; no INSTI major mutations. There were no changes in ART based on examination of the baseline genotype...","The reported mutations are NRTI-associated (implying analysis of reverse transcriptase/pol NRTI-associated regions) and INSTI-associated (integrase), so the genotyping must have covered RT and integrase regions. No protease mutations or protease sequencing are mentioned."
37701387,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not reported / sequencing methodology not specified in the text.,"There were no changes in ART based on examination of the baseline genotype (no NRTI mutations, only 3 accessory INSTI mutations [E157Q, G163K, L74I]; no INSTI major mutations). The Rainbow study is the first ART rapid treatment clinical trial focused on an advanced HIV population in a real-world clinical setting.","Although genotypic results are presented, the paper does not describe the laboratory methods or specific sequencing technology (e.g., Sanger, NGS) used to obtain the genotype; thus the sequencing method is not reported."
37701387,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Clinical blood samples (plasma/blood) from study participants; the paper refers to baseline HIV RNA and blood sampling.,"HIV RNA at BL, log10 cp/mL, median (IQR) 6.0 (5.4--6.4). During the study, patients will be asked to provide blood samples, to ensure viral efficacy and eventually selected drug-resistance mutations during treatment.","The manuscript cites baseline HIV RNA measurements and refers to collection of blood samples for monitoring and resistance testing, indicating that sequencing/genotyping was performed on clinical blood-derived samples (typically plasma)."
37701387,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No — sequences described were from ART‑naive individuals at baseline, not from persons with virological failure on treatment.",Rainbow was a pilot ... clinical trial ... 30 ART-naive participants ... were enrolled in the study. There were no ART interruptions due to toxicity or VF. No viral rebound was observed.,"The Rainbow participants were explicitly ART‑naive at enrollment and baseline genotypes were reported; there is no indication that sequences were obtained from individuals failing a treatment regimen, and no viral rebound or treatment failures were reported in the cohort described."
37701387,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,Yes — the Rainbow study was a prospective phase IV clinical trial (single-arm) and the LAPTOP study is described as an ongoing randomized controlled trial.,"The Rainbow study was a pilot, single-center, single-arm, prospective, phase IV, clinical trial conducted in a tertiary care Italian hospital from the 1st of May 2020 to the 31st of December 2021. The LAPTOP Study is currently still ongoing and the results were not yet available.",The manuscript explicitly identifies the Rainbow study as a phase IV clinical trial and refers to the LAPTOP study as a randomized controlled trial; therefore patients in Rainbow were enrolled in a clinical trial.
37701387,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No — the sequences described (baseline genotypes) come from ART‑naive individuals.,"Rainbow was a pilot ... clinical trial ... 30 ART-naive participants ... were enrolled in the study. In the OPERA cohort, all ART-naïve adults with advanced HIV (CD4<200 cells/μL) starting a three-drug regimen ... were selected.","Both the Rainbow study and the OPERA cohort are described as involving ART‑naive participants; the genotype data reported are baseline results from these ART‑naive individuals, so they were not previously exposed to antiretroviral drugs."

37817087,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No. The methods describe PCR amplification of target regions and direct Illumina NGS (MiSeq) sequencing of amplicons; no cloning step is reported.,"The cDNA then served as a template for the amplification of three regions of the HIV genome... The amplicons were sequenced using an Illumina NGS method (MiSeq). Viral RNA was isolated from the sample material (serum, plasma or spot elution) using the automated Biomerieux EasyMag platform.","The Methods describe extraction, reverse transcription, PCR amplification and next-generation sequencing of amplicons. There is no description of cloning (e.g., plasmid cloning or single-genome amplification/cloning) prior to sequencing, so samples were not cloned."
37817087,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN).","The cDNA then served as a template for the amplification of three regions of the HIV genome, which contain all major resistance-associated positions.

37817087,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"No — the study focuses on new diagnoses (primary/transmitted resistance). The authors note they cannot completely exclude that some cases previously treated abroad were misclassified as new diagnoses, but sequences from previously treated individuals are not specifically reported.","The transmission of resistant HIV variants jeopardizes the effective use of antiretrovirals for therapy and prophylaxis.

(iii) ... we cannot completely rule out that cases of acquired resistance that have already been diagnosed and treated abroad may have been misinterpreted as primary resistance if the viral load allows amplification.","The dataset derives from newly reported HIV diagnoses intended to capture primary (transmitted) resistance; while the discussion acknowledges possible misclassification of previously treated cases, the paper does not explicitly report sequences from known previously treated individuals."
37817087,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not reported. The paper does not provide information on antiretroviral drug classes received prior to sequencing by the sampled individuals (the analysis concerns transmitted resistance prevalence across NRTI, NNRTI, PI and INI classes but not prior exposures).","Among all cases in the analysis, the proportion of primary resistance was 4.3% for nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 9.2% for non-NRTI (NNRTIs), 3.3% for protease inhibitors (PIs) and 1.4% for integrase inhibitors (INIs). From 2017 to 2020, 11,527 new HIV diagnoses were reported in Germany to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).","The paper reports resistance prevalence by drug class but does not report which drug classes individuals had received prior to sampling; because the cohort is new diagnoses, prior ARV exposure is not reported as part of the dataset (except the caveat about possible misclassified treated cases)."

The mean age of the infants was 8.2 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.3--9.2), and the majority (62.7%, 95% CI 54.3--70.3%) had experienced exposure to antiretroviral drugs for PMTCT.",The methods clearly identify remnant dried blood spot specimens as the source material for nucleic acid extraction and sequencing.
37755428,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,No — sequences were from ART-naive infants; the mother's virus was not sequenced despite her having detectable viral load before delivery.,We report a case of DTG resistance detected in a treatment-naive perinatally HIV-infected infant whose mother was receiving tenofovir/lamivudine/dolutegravir. The infant was first diagnosed with HIV at 14 months of age and had received ZDV-based PNP. The mother was generally nonadherent to clinical appointments and had detectable HIV viral load 3 weeks before delivery (7761 copies/ml); no drug resistance test was conducted on the mother's virus.,"The study focused on ART-naive infants (sequenced), and although one mother had detectable viral load while on treatment, the mother's virus was not tested or sequenced, so no sequences in the paper come from individuals documented as failing ART."
37755428,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — the data derive from a national survey of HIV drug resistance, not a clinical trial.","We report a case of DTG resistance detected in an ART-naive infant identified in Haiti during a national survey of HIVDR in infants less than 18 months of age diagnosed with HIV through the country's early infant diagnosis program between April 2020 and March 2021. Following WHO survey guidance, Haiti conducted a survey of HIV drug resistance in infants between April 2020 and March 2021.","The manuscript repeatedly describes the work as a nationally representative survey conducted according to WHO survey guidance, with no indication that participants were enrolled in a clinical trial."
37755428,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"Yes — although infants were ART-naive, the majority had prior exposure to antiretroviral drugs for PMTCT and some infants received prophylaxis (e.g., ZDV-based PNP); mothers had received ART including DTG-based regimens.","The mean age of the infants was 8.2 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.3--9.2), and the majority (62.7%, 95% CI 54.3--70.3%) had experienced exposure to antiretroviral drugs for PMTCT. The infant was first diagnosed with HIV at 14 months of age and had received ZDV-based PNP. Most mothers had received DTG-based ART (70%, 95% CI 58.9--79.5).","The paper clarifies that infants were ART-naive (not on chronic ART) but a majority had prior exposure to ARVs for prevention of mother-to-child transmission and specific infants received prophylactic drugs; mothers also received ART prior to or during delivery, so sequences from infants represent individuals with prior ARV exposure."
37755428,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Reported exposures include nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) — e.g., zidovudine (ZDV), tenofovir, lamivudine — and integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) exposure via maternal dolutegravir. The paper also discusses prior use/exposure to NNRTIs in the context of PNP historically.","Most mothers had received DTG-based ART (70%, 95% CI 58.9--79.5). The infant was first diagnosed with HIV at 14 months of age and had received ZDV-based PNP. HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) in perinatally HIV-infected infants may occur because of infection with drug-resistant virus, exposure to sub-therapeutic levels of antiretroviral drugs in breastmilk or during infant postnatal prophylaxis (PNP).",The manuscript specifies maternal DTG-based ART (an INSTI with accompanying NRTIs) and infant ZDV prophylaxis (an NRTI). It also references NNRTI use in PNP in prior studies; therefore the primary classes documented in this study are NRTIs and INSTIs (with NNRTIs discussed in context).
37755428,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Specifically reported drugs include maternal tenofovir/lamivudine/dolutegravir (TDF/3TC/DTG) and infant ZDV-based postnatal prophylaxis; the paper also notes widespread DTG-based ART among mothers and PMTCT exposures generally.,"R263K ... was detected in one infant, whose mother was receiving tenofovir/lamivudine/dolutegravir as a fixed-dose combination for the treatment of her HIV infection. The infant was first diagnosed with HIV at 14 months of age and had received ZDV-based PNP. Most mothers had received DTG-based ART (70%, 95% CI 58.9--79.5), and most infants (55.2%, 95% CI 46.5--62.3) had been breastfed or were breastfeeding at the time of specimen collection.","The case description names the mother's regimen explicitly (TDF/3TC/DTG) and the infant's prophylaxis (ZDV-based PNP). The wider survey results note that most mothers received DTG-based ART and many infants had PMTCT/prophylactic exposure, supporting these specific drug exposures prior to sequencing."
37775947,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,"Stored plasma from participants with entry HIV RNA >1000 copies/mL were analysed using NGS (llumina MiSeq).

A plasma sample, taken within 60 days before enrolment was obtained from all participants who provided consent for stored specimens.","Enrollment dates define the period during which baseline samples were collected; the paper states enrollment was April 2009–December 2013 and baseline plasma samples were taken within 60 days prior to enrolment, so samples date from that interval."
37775947,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No — cloning is not reported; samples were amplified and sequenced by NGS without mention of cloning.,"Methods for sample preparation, amplification of viral RNA and NGS, identification of DRM by means of VirVarSeq, and determination of HIV subtype have been described elsewhere. Sequence reads (FASTQ files) were analyzed with VirVarSeq version 20140929, which calls variants at the codon level.",The methods describe RNA amplification and next-generation sequencing and variant calling but do not mention cloning of viral genomes or single-genome amplification; therefore cloning was not performed or not reported.
37775947,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"The pol gene was sequenced (positions 1–935 covering protease positions 1–99, reverse transcriptase positions 100–659, and partial integrase positions 660–935).","From the output, we extracted amino acid frequencies in the pol gene from amino acid position 1--935 where positions 1--99 encode protease protein, positions 100--659 encode reverse transcriptase protein, and positions 660--935 partially encode integrase protein (our amplicon did not cover positions 936--947).","The manuscript explicitly states the region of pol that was covered by the amplicon and which portions correspond to protease, RT and partial integrase, so pol (protease, RT, partial integrase) was sequenced."
37775947,10,What method was used for sequencing?,"Next-generation sequencing using Illumina MiSeq, with variant calling by VirVarSeq.","Stored plasma from participants ... were analysed using NGS (llumina MiSeq). Sequence reads (FASTQ files) were analyzed with VirVarSeq version 20140929, which calls variants at the codon level.","The Methods explicitly name Illumina MiSeq for NGS and VirVarSeq for sequence analysis/variant calling, indicating the sequencing and analysis pipeline used."
37775947,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Stored plasma samples.,"A plasma sample, taken within 60 days before enrolment was obtained from all participants who provided consent for stored specimens. Stored plasma from participants with entry HIV RNA >1000 copies/mL were analysed using NGS (llumina MiSeq).",The text repeatedly refers to stored plasma samples as the source material for RNA extraction and sequencing.
37775947,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,No — sequences were from ART-naïve participants at baseline; they were not sampled while failing therapy.,Participants in START were treatment naïve because this was an entry criterion for the trial. Stored plasma from participants with entry HIV RNA >1000 copies/mL were analysed using NGS (llumina MiSeq).,"The study sequenced baseline samples from ART-naïve participants enrolled at entry; although some participants later experienced virological failure, sequencing was performed on pre-treatment samples, not on samples collected during treatment failure."

The main objective of this analysis was to evaluate the impact of pre-existing drug resistance by next-generation sequencing (NGS) ... in participants enrolled in the START study.","The manuscript repeatedly references the START trial and that participants were enrolled in that trial, indicating this is a clinical trial population."
37775947,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No — the participants were antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve at enrollment.,Baseline NGS data were available for 1380 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve participants enrolled over 2009--2013. Participants in START were treatment naïve because this was an entry criterion for the trial.,"The entry criterion of the START trial was ART-naïve status and the paper repeatedly describes the analyzed participants as ART-naïve, so sequences are from individuals without prior ARV exposure."
37775947,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"None prior to sequencing (participants were ART-naïve). After sequencing, first-line regimens initiated included NRTIs (tenofovir + emtricitabine or 3TC) plus either an NNRTI, a boosted protease inhibitor, or an integrase strand transfer inhibitor.","Participants in START were treatment naïve because this was an entry criterion for the trial. First-line ART included a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) in 976 (71%), a boosted protease inhibitor in 297 (22%), or an integrase strand transfer inhibitor in 107 (8%). Supplementary Figure S2 shows the breakdown of antiretroviral regimens; the large majority of the population initiated a triple-drug regimen that included tenofovir/emtricitabine (FTC).","Because participants were ART-naïve at the time samples were taken, they had not received ARV drug classes before sequencing. The paper does describe the drug classes used in the first-line regimens initiated after baseline sampling."
37775947,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"None prior to sequencing. After baseline, commonly initiated drugs/regimens included tenofovir and emtricitabine (FTC) or lamivudine (3TC) as NRTI backbone, and efavirenz (NNRTI) was commonly used; other drugs mentioned include rilpivirine, raltegravir, elvitegravir and boosted protease inhibitors.","Participants in START were treatment naïve because this was an entry criterion for the trial. The large majority of the population initiated a triple-drug regimen that included tenofovir/emtricitabine (FTC) ... in combination with efavirenz (77% of the GSS = 0--2.75 group vs. 63% of the GSS = 3 group). Using the 20% Sanger threshold, participants' viruses showed high-level resistance to efavirenz (3%) and lamivudine (3TC) (0.7 and 0.2%, respectively) ... by lowering the threshold for resistance detection to >2%, ... a higher percentage ... had high-level resistance to raltegravir (1.5%) and ... to rilpivirine and efavirenz.","No drugs were given prior to the baseline sampling because participants were ART-naïve. The manuscript lists the specific drugs used in the first-line regimens after baseline (tenofovir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, efavirenz, rilpivirine, raltegravir, elvitegravir, and boosted PIs), which indicates which drugs participants received following sequencing rather than before it."

GRT was done when the viral load was > 1000 copies/mL using an in-house protocol.,"Sequencing of PCR products on an Applied Biosystems 3500 indicates capillary (Sanger) sequencing. The Methods describe an in-house PCR protocol with specific primers followed by ABI 3500 sequencing and sequence editing, confirming the method."
37878637,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma samples (viral RNA extracted from plasma obtained from whole blood).,"From these, a whole blood aliquot (for CD4 enumeration) was gotten. Moreover, plasma aliquots (for PVL and HIV genotypic resistance testing, GRT) were obtained after centrifugation at 1600 rpm for 10 minutes and stored at −80°C for further analyses. HIV-1 RNA was extracted manually from 140 μL of plasma using the QIAGEN protocol...","The Methods state that plasma aliquots were used for PVL and genotypic resistance testing and that HIV-1 RNA was extracted from plasma, indicating plasma-derived viral RNA was sequenced."
37878637,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Yes — sequences were obtained from participants experiencing virological failure (PVL ≥ 1000 RNA copies/mL) while on ART.,"Sequencing of protease and reverse transcriptase regions was performed for participants experiencing virological failure, VF, (Plasma viral load, PVL ≥ 1000 RNA copies/ml).

Included in the study were APHI; aged 10--19 years, receiving a standard reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based first- or ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor-based second-line ART regimen for at least 6 months...",The manuscript repeatedly describes the work as a cohort study (READY-study) with observational follow-up at enrollment and scheduled visits; there is no indication of interventional assignments or clinical trial enrollment.
37878637,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes — participants were on ART (first- or second-line regimens) and some had prior exposure to PMTCT; sequences were obtained from these treated individuals.,"Included in the study were APHI; aged 10--19 years, receiving a standard reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based first- or ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor-based second-line ART regimen for at least 6 months... Participants were recruited ... irrespective of exposure to the prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) antiretrovirals. The majority (89.1%, 77.1%, 66.7) of the participants were on first-line treatment ( Table 2 ).","Eligibility required participants to be on ART for at least 6 months (first- or second-line), and the text notes PMTCT exposure was allowed; thus sequences derive from individuals previously or currently exposed to ARV drugs."
37878637,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs).","Included in the study were APHI; ... receiving a standard reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based first- or ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor-based second-line ART regimen for at least 6 months. Acquired drug resistance was driven by the drug classes of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (96.4%, 88.5%, and 85.0%).","The Methods and Results describe first-line RTI-based regimens and second-line ritonavir-boosted PI regimens; results also indicate acquired resistance was driven by NNRTIs and NRTIs, confirming these classes were used prior to sequencing."
37878637,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Commonly reported regimens included TDF (tenofovir), 3TC (lamivudine), and EFV (efavirenz) as the predominant first-line combination; some participants were switched to ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor-based second-line regimens.","Most of the participants (34.5%, 31.3%, and 31.7%) were on a TDF + 3TC + EFV-based regimen ( Table 2 ). There was an increased rate of switch to second-line protease inhibitor-based ART (10.9%, 22.9%, and 33.3%, p = 0.0007) favored by the presence of acquired drug resistance mutations to previous treatment.","The Results explicitly state the majority were on TDF+3TC+EFV first-line regimens and that switches to ritonavir-boosted PI second-line regimens occurred; the paper does not list other individual drug names in detail, so the named drugs (TDF, 3TC, EFV) and ritonavir-boosted PIs are reported."

37910452,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,"Zero — the paper does not report any HIV sequencing; therefore no individuals had samples obtained for sequencing. The review included 4,436 HIV-positive patients across the 14 adherence studies.","A total of 4,436 HIV-positive patients were studied across the 14 studies to ascertain their adherence to ART with sample sizes ranging from 25 to 683. Key information extracted included author detail, year of publication, study setting, study design, sample size, sampling method, the method used to measure adherence and proportion of adherence to ART.","While the review aggregated participant counts from included adherence studies (4,436 patients), it did not perform or report HIV sequencing on those samples. Thus no individuals in this paper had samples obtained specifically for sequencing."
37910452,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable — no sequencing was performed; the included studies were conducted in Ghana.,Studies were included if (1) they were conducted in Ghana. The studies were predominantly conducted in health facilities in the Ashanti (4/14; 28.6%) and Greater Accra (4/14; 28.6%) regions of Ghana.,"The review inclusion criteria and study characteristics specify that all included studies were conducted in Ghana (various regions). Since no sequencing was reported, there are no sequenced samples from any country; the underlying studies were Ghanaian."

37910452,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Not applicable — the paper does not report sequencing and thus no sample types were sequenced.,"A total of 4,436 HIV-positive patients were studied across the 14 studies to ascertain their adherence to ART with sample sizes ranging from 25 to 683. Key information extracted included ... the method used to measure adherence and proportion of adherence to ART.","The included studies and the review focus on adherence measurements (self-report, pill count, attendance-based metrics), and there is no mention of biological sample collection or sequencing, so there are no sequenced sample types to report."
37910452,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,No — the paper does not report any sequences; it discusses risk of treatment failure due to sub-optimal adherence but provides no virological failure sequencing data.,"This pooled adherence estimate is far below the recommended ≥95% required to achieve viral suppression. The implementation of the interventions will also be important to reduce drug resistance, reduce new infections and reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality among PLHIV, especially among adolescents and young adults who have increased risk of treatment failure due to sub-optimal adherence to ART.","Although the discussion addresses the clinical consequence of poor adherence (including treatment failure and potential drug resistance), the study itself compiles adherence data and does not present virological or sequencing data from individuals with treatment failure."
37910452,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"Some included studies were randomized controlled trials, but the review as a whole is a meta-analysis of diverse study designs; no sequencing was associated with trial participants.","Study designs used include surveys, randomized control trials, and a prospective cohort. Studies were included if (1) they were conducted in Ghana (2) used observational or experimental designs that explicitly measured adherence to ART, either as a primary or secondary outcome; For experimental studies, baseline adherence was considered.","The review included a mix of study types and explicitly notes that randomized controlled trials were among the included studies. However, because the paper synthesizes adherence outcomes across studies (and does not perform sequencing), there is no sequencing-specific link to trial participation."
37910452,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No — the paper does not report any HIV sequences from individuals (regardless of prior ARV exposure). It discusses individuals on ART in general but provides no sequence data.,"A total of 4,436 HIV-positive patients were studied across the 14 studies to ascertain their adherence to ART. Findings from our review could be used by the Ghana National AIDS/STI Control programme (NACP) and the Ghana Health Service (GHS) to optimize ART clinical services and adherence support within the current healthcare systems.","While the reviewed participants were individuals receiving ART (antiretroviral therapy) and the review discusses prior ARV exposure implicitly by virtue of adherence, the manuscript contains no genetic or sequence data from these individuals."
37910452,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not applicable — no sequencing was performed and the paper does not detail specific antiretroviral drug classes; it refers generically to antiretroviral therapy (ART).,"Maintaining a high level of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is critical to limiting rapid viral replication, drug resistance, and viral transmission. The pooled adherence estimate of 70% was found among persons living with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy.","The review repeatedly references ART but does not list specific drug classes (e.g., NRTI, NNRTI, PI, INSTI) received by participants. Because no sequencing was done, there are no sequencing-linked drug-class data to report."
37910452,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not reported — the paper does not specify individual antiretroviral drugs received by participants; it only refers to ART in general and no sequencing was performed.,This systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed to synthesize available evidence on adherence to ART among HIV/AIDS patients in Ghana. The pooled adherence estimate of 70% was found among persons living with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy.,"The manuscript focuses on adherence prevalence and methods of adherence assessment and does not provide details on specific ARV medications taken by participants in the included studies, nor any sequencing data linking to drug exposure."
37896785,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes. The paper reports HIV-1 nucleotide sequences obtained from patient plasma samples.,"The study material was blood plasma samples from HIV-infected pregnant women: 31 women showed virological failure of ART, and 30 women had not previously received therapy. HIV-1 genotyping and mutation detection were performed based on analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the pol gene region.","The Methods and Abstract explicitly state that blood plasma from 61 pregnant women was used and that HIV-1 genotyping was performed by analyzing nucleotide sequences of the pol gene region, indicating that sequences from patient samples were generated."

37896785,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Individual-level ARV histories are not fully reported due to limited anamnesis and anonymity; however the paper cites common drugs/regimens used in Vietnam and drugs implicated by the detected resistance mutations, including stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), zidovudine (AZT), nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), lamivudine/emtricitabine (3TC/FTC), and PIs such as lopinavir (LPV), darunavir (DRV), and others mentioned (e.g., fosamprenavir (FPV), indinavir, tipranavir, ritonavir).","Some difficulty in interpreting the data is created by the poor availability of some information from the anamnesis, including the complete anonymity of the samples transmitted to us for work. In Vietnam, available three-drug first-line ART regimens meet WHO standards: two NRTIs (stavudine (d4T)/lamivudine (3TC) or zidovudine (AZT)/lamivudine) together with one NNRTI (nevirapine (NVP) or efavirenz (EFV)). The most common mutations in our study group were polymorphic substitutions ... Mutations of drug resistance to the protease inhibitor darunavir have been identified. In three women (4.92%), we identified the I50V mutation, selected by FPV, LPV, DRV, and reduced susceptibility to LPV and DRV.","The manuscript notes limited individual treatment history availability (anonymity), so it does not list each subject's drugs. It does, however, describe the national first-line drugs (d4T, 3TC, AZT, NVP, EFV) and discusses observed mutations tied to specific drugs (e.g., M184V linked to lamivudine/emtricitabine; I50V linked to FPV/LPV/DRV), allowing inference of drugs commonly used or implicated by resistance, but not a definitive per-patient drug list."

37872202,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes. The study uses HIV env sequences derived from previously reported patient-derived isolates (including a transmitted/founder CRF01_AE T/F100 from participant 40100 of the RV217 cohort) and engineered env constructs.,"This Env was derived from a transmitted/founder CRF01_AE strain isolated from participant 40100 of the RV217 Early Capture HIV Cohort Study conducted in Thailand. The plasmids expressing the CRF01_AE Envs HIV-1 92TH023 and HIV-1 CM244 were previously reported in [38,61].",The Methods and Results explicitly state that the T/F100 SOSIP.664 Env was derived from a transmitted/founder strain isolated from participant 40100 of the RV217 cohort and that the CRF01_AE Envs 92TH023 and CM244 plasmids were previously reported. These statements indicate the paper uses HIV sequences originating from patient isolates (though many constructs used are plasmid-borne or engineered for experiments).
37872202,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,Yes. The paper reports in vitro neutralization/drug susceptibility data for temsavir using single-round luciferase-expressing pseudovirus neutralization assays and reports IC50 values.,Recombinant HIV-1 pseudoviruses expressing luciferase and bearing wild type (WT) or mutant Env JR-FL were used to infect Cf2Th-CD4/CCR5 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of temsavir. Neutralization half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) were calculated by non-linear regression using the Graphpad Prism software.,"The Methods and Results describe single-round pseudovirus neutralization assays performed with increasing concentrations of temsavir and explicit calculation of IC50 values, which constitute in vitro drug susceptibility data."

Thus no explicit number of individuals sequenced is reported."
37872202,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,"The transmitted/founder CRF01_AE T/F100 Env was derived from a participant in Thailand; origins of other referenced env constructs (e.g., 92TH023, CM244) are noted as previously reported but specific countries for those constructs are not specified in this paper.","This Env was derived from a transmitted/founder CRF01_AE strain isolated from participant 40100 of the RV217 Early Capture HIV Cohort Study conducted in Thailand. The plasmids expressing the CRF01_AE Envs HIV-1 92TH023 and HIV-1 CM244 were previously reported in [38,61].","The Methods explicitly states the T/F100 Env comes from a participant in the RV217 cohort in Thailand. While the paper uses additional env constructs that were previously reported, it does not state country of origin for those constructs within this manuscript, so only Thailand can be confirmed from the provided text."
37872202,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,The paper does not report the years when the original patient-derived sequences were obtained.,"The plasmids expressing the CRF01_AE Envs HIV-1 92TH023 and HIV-1 CM244 were previously reported in [38,61]. This Env was derived from a transmitted/founder CRF01_AE strain isolated from participant 40100 of the RV217 Early Capture HIV Cohort Study conducted in Thailand.","Although the manuscript cites previously reported env constructs and specifies the cohort source for T/F100, it does not give collection years or dates for those isolates within the text. Therefore the years of sample collection are not provided in this paper."
37872202,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Yes—env sequences used in the study were present in cloned expression plasmids and mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis with confirmation by automated DNA sequencing.,Mutations were introduced individually or in combination into the different Env expressors using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). The presence of the desired mutations was determined by automated DNA sequencing.,The Methods describe introducing mutations into env expression plasmids by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis and verifying the presence of mutations by automated DNA sequencing. This indicates the env sequences analyzed were cloned in plasmids and sequenced in that cloned context.
37872202,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,env gene products were the focus: gp120/gp41 regions and stabilized gp140 (SOSIP.664) trimers were used and analyzed (Env/gp120/gp41/gp140).,The plasmid encoding the transmitted/founder CRF01_AE HIV-1 40100 (T/F100) SOSIP.664 gp140 trimer was previously described in [41].

The Methods also discuss Env expressors and Env numbering, confirming that env (gp120/gp41/gp140) sequences were the sequenced/validated regions."
37872202,10,What method was used for sequencing?,"Automated DNA sequencing was used to confirm the presence of introduced mutations in the env expression plasmids; the manuscript does not specify the platform (e.g., Sanger vs. NGS).",Mutations were introduced individually or in combination into the different Env expressors using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene).

No further detail on sequencing technology is provided, so only 'automated DNA sequencing' can be confirmed from the text."
37872202,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Cloned env expression plasmids and engineered protein constructs were sequenced/validated; experimental assays used recombinant luciferase-expressing pseudoviruses produced from transfected HEK293T cells and purified SOSIP.664 gp140 proteins from Expi293F cells.,HEK293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with the proviral vector pNL4.3 (Vpr-/Env-)Luc and a plasmid expressing wild type or mutant HIV-1 Env at a ratio of 2:1. The plasmid encoding the transmitted/founder CRF01_AE HIV-1 40100 (T/F100) SOSIP.664 gp140 trimer was previously described in [41].,The Methods describe using env expression plasmids (which were mutagenized and sequenced) to produce pseudoviruses and expressing/purifying SOSIP gp140 proteins in cell culture. Thus the sequenced materials were cloned plasmid constructs encoding env and engineered protein constructs rather than primary patient-derived viral RNA directly sequenced as part of this study.
37872202,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,No. The manuscript does not report sequences from individuals characterized as experiencing virological failure on antiretroviral therapy.,"This Env was derived from a transmitted/founder CRF01_AE strain isolated from participant 40100 of the RV217 Early Capture HIV Cohort Study conducted in Thailand. The plasmids expressing the CRF01_AE Envs HIV-1 92TH023 and HIV-1 CM244 were previously reported in [38,61].","The paper focuses on structural and functional analysis of env variants and uses previously reported env plasmids and a transmitted/founder isolate. No clinical information about antiretroviral treatment or virological failure of source individuals is provided in the text, so there is no evidence that sequences from individuals with virological failure were included."
37872202,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No. The manuscript does not describe enrolling patients in a clinical trial; it uses previously collected cohort-derived material (RV217 Early Capture HIV Cohort) and previously reported env constructs.,"This Env was derived from a transmitted/founder CRF01_AE strain isolated from participant 40100 of the RV217 Early Capture HIV Cohort Study conducted in Thailand. The plasmids expressing the CRF01_AE Envs HIV-1 92TH023 and HIV-1 CM244 were previously reported in [38,61].","The source described is a cohort study (RV217) and the paper does not mention any clinical trial enrollment or that patients in this work were participants in a clinical trial. The experiments performed are laboratory-based using plasmids, pseudoviruses, and recombinant proteins."

The plasmids expressing the CRF01_AE Envs HIV-1 92TH023 and HIV-1 CM244 were previously reported in [38,61].","Although the manuscript cites the origin of one transmitted/founder Env and uses previously reported env constructs, it contains no information on antiretroviral therapy histories of source individuals. Therefore there is no evidence in this paper that sequences came from individuals with prior ARV exposure."
37872202,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not reported. The manuscript does not provide antiretroviral treatment histories or list drug classes received by source individuals.,"The plasmids expressing the CRF01_AE Envs HIV-1 92TH023 and HIV-1 CM244 were previously reported in [38,61].

37872202,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not reported. The manuscript does not state any specific antiretroviral drugs received by the individuals who provided the source env sequences.,"The HIV-1 attachment inhibitor temsavir (BMS-626529) was purchased from APExBIO. The compound was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a stock concentration of 10 mM, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until further use.","While the paper describes the experimental use of the drug temsavir in vitro, it does not provide any information about antiretroviral drugs received by the individuals from whom env sequences were derived. Consequently, no patient-level ARV drug names are reported in the manuscript."

A total of 76 patients enrolled in this study had been tested for pre-existing resistance by conventional Sanger sequencing at baseline, with results suggesting that no resistance mutations were detected.","The manuscript explicitly states that baseline plasma samples from 76 patients were analyzed using the MiSeq sequencing platform to detect pre-existing low-frequency drug resistance mutations, indicating that HIV sequences were generated from patient samples. The mention of both Sanger and MiSeq testing clarifies that sequencing was performed on patient-derived material."
37914679,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No — the paper does not report in vitro drug susceptibility (phenotypic) assay data.,"The study was designed to detect pre-existing low-frequency resistance mutations in HIV-1-infected patients using the MiSeq second-generation sequencing platform to investigate their impact on virological response in HIV-1 naïve patients. The manuscript reports detection rates and specific resistance mutations (NNRTI, NRTI, PI, INSTI classes) but does not describe in vitro phenotypic susceptibility testing.","The paper focuses on sequencing-based detection of resistance mutations and clinical virological outcomes; there is no description of phenotypic drug susceptibility assays, IC50/FC values, or in vitro phenotyping methods or results, so no in vitro susceptibility data were reported."

37914679,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,76 individuals had samples obtained and sequenced.,"All of the 76 HIV-1-infected patients with baseline plasma pre-existing low-frequency drug resistance mutations were detected by the MiSeq second-generation sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). A total of 76 patients enrolled in this study had been tested for pre-existing resistance by conventional Sanger sequencing at baseline, with results suggesting that no resistance mutations were detected.","The manuscript repeatedly states the cohort size as 76 patients who underwent sequencing (both Sanger at baseline and MiSeq), so the number of individuals with samples sequenced is 76."
37914679,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,China.,"HIV-1 ART-naïve patients attending the Second Hospital of Nanjing during January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020, with drug-sensitive results from traditional pre-existing drug resistance test, were enrolled in this study. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Second Hospital of Nanjing (No. 2018-LY-kt027).","The study population was recruited at the Second Hospital of Nanjing and approvals and funding are from Jiangsu/Nanjing health bodies, indicating the samples were collected in China."

They received ART and were followed up for 12 months, with viral load monitoring at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months of treatment.","The manuscript explicitly states the enrollment period as Jan 1, 2018 to Dec 31, 2020, which is the timeframe when baseline (pre-treatment) samples for sequencing were obtained."
37914679,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No indication of cloning prior to sequencing is given; samples were amplified and directly analyzed by MiSeq.,"All of the 76 HIV-1-infected patients with baseline plasma pre-existing low-frequency drug resistance mutations were detected by the MiSeq second-generation sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Among the 76 patients who underwent second-generation sequencing, the success rate of amplification was 100%.","The methods describe amplification and MiSeq sequencing but do not mention molecular cloning of viral genomes or cloning-based sequencing; the reported 100% amplification success and use of MiSeq suggests direct NGS of PCR amplicons rather than cloning, so there is no evidence that cloning was performed prior to sequencing."
37914679,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"The paper does not explicitly name gene regions, but reported mutations map to reverse transcriptase (RT) and indicate assessment of pol-associated regions (RT and also PI and INSTI regions — implying protease and integrase were assessed).","Low-frequency resistance mutations were detected in a total of 18 loci, with a total number of 26 mutations, and the mutations were predominantly in the NNRTI class of resistance, which accounted for 53.8% (14/26) of the mutated loci, including V179 (19.2%, 5/26), Y188 (7.7%, 2/26), and E138 (7.7%, 2/26). The NRTI class resistance mutation rate was 38.5% (10/26), including K65 (7.7%, 2/26) and D67 (7.7%, 2/26). In addition, one HIV-infected patient with low-frequency resistance in the PI class and one with low-frequency resistance in the integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) class were detected, respectively.","Although the manuscript does not explicitly state which gene fragments were sequenced, the specific reported mutations (V179, Y188, E138, K65, D67) are positions in reverse transcriptase, and the mention of PI and INSTI class resistance implies assessment of protease and integrase regions. Therefore, sequencing covered pol gene regions encoding RT and likely protease and integrase, but this is inferred rather than explicitly stated."
37914679,10,What method was used for sequencing?,MiSeq second-generation (Illumina) sequencing platform was used.,"All of the 76 HIV-1-infected patients with baseline plasma pre-existing low-frequency drug resistance mutations were detected by the MiSeq second-generation sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The study was designed to detect pre-existing low-frequency resistance mutations in HIV-1-infected patients using the MiSeq second-generation sequencing platform to investigate their impact on virological response in HIV-1 naïve patients.","The manuscript explicitly states the use of the Illumina MiSeq second-generation sequencing platform for detecting pre-existing low-frequency resistance mutations, so the sequencing method is MiSeq NGS."
37914679,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Baseline plasma samples (plasma viral RNA) were sequenced.,"All of the 76 HIV-1-infected patients with baseline plasma pre-existing low-frequency drug resistance mutations were detected by the MiSeq second-generation sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). A total of 76 patients enrolled in this study had been tested for pre-existing resistance by conventional Sanger sequencing at baseline...","The text repeatedly refers to 'baseline plasma' pre-existing resistance detection, indicating that plasma-derived viral RNA (baseline plasma samples) were the specimen type used for sequencing."
37914679,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Yes — sequences were obtained from both patients who later experienced virological failure and from those with successful virological response.,"Thirty-eight patients who failed antiviral therapy were defined as the failure group according to the study definition criteria, and 38 successful virological responders were matched as the control group. All of the 76 HIV-1-infected patients with baseline plasma pre-existing low-frequency drug resistance mutations were detected by the MiSeq second-generation sequencing platform.","Baseline sequences were generated for all 76 patients, which included the 38 individuals who were later classified as virological failures; thus sequences were obtained from individuals who experienced virological failure on treatment (sequencing was performed prior to or at baseline)."
37914679,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — this was a retrospective single-center observational study, not a clinical trial.","In this retrospective study, the presence of HIV pre-existing low-frequency resistance mutations was significantly higher in the post-ART virological failure group than in the successful virological response group. HIV-1 ART-naïve patients attending the Second Hospital of Nanjing during January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020...were enrolled in this study.","The authors describe the study as retrospective and single-center and do not indicate enrollment in a randomized or interventional clinical trial. Patients were treated per standard care and retrospectively analyzed, so they were not participants in a clinical trial."
37914679,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"No — the study enrolled ART-naïve patients, so sequences were from individuals who had not previously received antiretroviral drugs.","Therefore, in response to previous studies showing inconclusive effects of pre-existing low-frequency resistance mutations on antiretroviral efficacy in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-infected patients, the study was designed to detect pre-existing low-frequency resistance mutations in HIV-1-infected patients using the MiSeq second-generation sequencing platform to investigate their impact on virological response in HIV-1 naïve patients. HIV-1 ART-naïve patients attending the Second Hospital of Nanjing during January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020...were enrolled in this study.","The manuscript repeatedly specifies enrollment of ART-naïve (treatment-naïve) patients, indicating that sequencing was performed on samples from individuals who had not previously received antiretroviral therapy."
37914679,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,None — individuals were ART-naïve before baseline sequencing.,"HIV-1 ART-naïve patients attending the Second Hospital of Nanjing during January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020...were enrolled in this study. The initial treatment regimen of patients in this study population was predominantly 2NRTI + NNRTI in 77.6% (59/76), while the remaining 17 patients were on an INSTI-based antiviral regimen.","The cohort consisted of ART-naïve patients at baseline (when sequencing was done), so they had not received any antiretroviral drug classes prior to sample sequencing. The manuscript's mention of initial treatment regimens refers to therapy initiated after baseline sampling."
37914679,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,None — no specific antiretroviral drugs were received prior to baseline sequencing because participants were ART-naïve.,"HIV-1 ART-naïve patients attending the Second Hospital of Nanjing during January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020...were enrolled in this study. The initial treatment regimen of patients in this study population was predominantly 2NRTI + NNRTI in 77.6% (59/76), while the remaining 17 patients were on an INSTI-based antiviral regimen.","Because the sequencing was performed on ART-naïve patients at baseline, no individual had received antiretroviral drugs prior to the sampled sequencing. The listed initial regimens describe therapy started after baseline sampling and therefore do not apply to the period before sequencing."
37938856,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes — the paper reports HIV drug resistance mutation testing by sequencing on patient samples.,"HIV DRM testing was performed at the two accredited centralized laboratories in Kenya using Sanger sequencing for participants in the intervention group with VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml. In the intervention group, 52 DRM tests were requested, of which 46 (88%) were successfully conducted and all identified at least one DRM.","The Methods explicitly state that HIV DRM testing was performed using Sanger sequencing on participants with VL ≥1000 copies/ml, and the Results report the number of DRM tests conducted and mutations identified. These statements show that sequences (genotypic DRM data) were generated from patient samples."
37938856,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No — the paper reports genotypic DRM testing (Sanger sequencing) but does not report in vitro phenotypic drug susceptibility assays.,"HIV DRM testing was performed at the two accredited centralized laboratories in Kenya using Sanger sequencing for participants in the intervention group with VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml. The paper describes identified DRMs (e.g., K103N and M184V) and does not mention any phenotypic or in vitro susceptibility testing or results.","The Methods and Results describe genotypic (Sanger) sequencing and report specific resistance mutations, but there is no mention of phenotypic susceptibility testing (in vitro assays) or phenotype results in the manuscript. Therefore, only genotypic resistance data were reported."
37938856,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No evidence of public deposition of sequences is provided in the paper.,"De-identified participant data, data dictionary or other specified data sets may be made available to others requesting them upon communication with corresponding author, demonstration of appropriate ethic reviews and establishment of data sharing agreements. The manuscript does not list GenBank accession numbers or state that sequences were deposited in a public sequence repository.","The Data Availability Statement describes availability of de-identified participant data on request but does not state that sequence data were deposited in a public database (e.g., GenBank) nor provides accession numbers. No section of the paper provides accession identifiers, so there is no evidence that sequences were made publicly available."
37938856,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,No GenBank accession numbers are reported in the paper.,"De-identified participant data, data dictionary or other specified data sets may be made available to others requesting them upon communication with corresponding author, demonstration of appropriate ethic reviews and establishment of data sharing agreements. The paper does not provide any GenBank accession numbers or list sequence accessions.","A search through the Methods, Results, Supplementary references in the provided content yields no GenBank accession identifiers or statements of sequence deposition. The Data Availability Statement only addresses de-identified participant data requests and does not indicate public sequence deposition; hence no accession numbers are reported."
37938856,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Sequencing (successful DRM tests) was obtained from 46 samples (46 tests successfully conducted).,"In the intervention group, 52 DRM tests were requested, of which 46 (88%) were successfully conducted (six samples failed to amplify). In the intervention group, from enrolment up until 6 months postpartum, we identified 54 episodes of VL>1000 copies/ml, among 48 (11.7%) participants.","The Results state 52 DRM tests were requested and 46 were successfully conducted; those 46 represent the samples for which sequencing/DRM results were obtained. Although 48 participants experienced VL>1000 copies/ml, successful sequence results were reported for 46 tests/samples."
37938856,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Kenya.,"The study was conducted in low-resource, high-HIV burden public sector facilities in Kisumu County, western Kenya. HIV DRM testing was performed at the two accredited centralized laboratories in Kenya using Sanger sequencing for participants in the intervention group with VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml.","The study setting is explicitly western Kenya (Kisumu County) and the sequencing was performed at Kenyan centralized laboratories, indicating that the sequenced samples originated from participants in Kenya."
37938856,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Sequenced samples were obtained during the study's intervention period (approximately 2019–2021).,"We conducted an open-label, pre/post-intervention prospective cohort study ... in five public-sector HIV treatment facilities in Kenya from February 2019 to November 2022. The intervention group enrolment started on 7 October 2019 and follow-up lasted until 31 December 2021. In the intervention group, from enrolment up until 6 months postpartum, we identified 54 episodes of VL>1000 copies/ml.","Sequencing (DRM testing) was performed for intervention-group participants with VL≥1000 during the intervention group's enrollment and follow-up windows. The intervention group enrollment began October 2019 and follow-up continued through December 2021, so the DRM sequencing occurred during that 2019–2021 timeframe (the broader study spanned into 2022, but intervention DRM testing aligns with the 2019–2021 intervention follow-up period)."
37938856,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No — there is no indication that samples were cloned prior to sequencing; Sanger sequencing is reported without mention of cloning.,HIV DRM testing was performed at the two accredited centralized laboratories in Kenya using Sanger sequencing for participants in the intervention group with VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml. The Methods and Results describe DRM testing and PCR amplification failures (six samples failed to amplify) but do not describe any cloning steps.,"The manuscript specifies Sanger sequencing of DRM regions but does not mention cloning of PCR products or cloning vectors; given the absence of any cloning description and the direct reference to Sanger sequencing of clinical samples, there is no evidence that sequences were derived from cloned inserts."
37938856,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"The paper does not explicitly state the gene region(s) sequenced; however, reported mutations (K103N, M184V) indicate sequencing of the reverse transcriptase (RT) region.","HIV DRM testing was performed ... using Sanger sequencing for participants in the intervention group with VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml. In the intervention group ... all identified at least one DRM (K103N [n = 12, 28%] and M184V [n = 10, 22%] were most commonly detected mutations).","The manuscript does not explicitly list which gene(s) or genomic regions were amplified/sequenced. It does, however, report specific resistance mutations K103N and M184V, which are canonical reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations associated with NNRTI and NRTI resistance, respectively. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, the data imply sequencing of the RT region (and possibly protease if other DRMs had been reported), but the paper does not directly specify the gene targets."
37938856,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Sanger sequencing.,HIV DRM testing was performed at the two accredited centralized laboratories in Kenya using Sanger sequencing for participants in the intervention group with VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml.,"The Methods explicitly state that Sanger sequencing was used for HIV DRM testing, so this is the sequencing method reported."
37938856,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,"Clinical blood-derived samples (samples associated with viral load testing from blood draws), presumably plasma/viral RNA, though the paper does not explicitly state 'plasma'.","HIV DRM testing was performed ... for participants in the intervention group with VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml. The proportion of women with VS at enrolment in the intervention group was 343/379 (90%) by POC VL testing, and POC VL tests conducted in the intervention group during the entire study period were returned to the participant (referring to blood draws).","The DRM testing was triggered by elevated viral load measurements, and VL testing in the study was performed on blood draws (POC VL from blood). The paper does not explicitly state 'plasma' or 'viral RNA extraction from plasma', but the linkage to VL testing and blood draws implies sequencing was performed on blood-derived viral material (commonly plasma RNA)."
37938856,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"Yes — DRM sequencing was performed on participants with viral load >1000 copies/ml (viraemia), i.e., virological failure while on ART.","HIV DRM testing was performed ... for participants in the intervention group with VL ≥ 1000 copies/ml. In the intervention group, from enrolment up until 6 months postpartum, we identified 54 episodes of VL>1000 copies/ml, among 48 (11.7%) participants, and 46 DRM tests were successfully conducted.","The Methods and Results indicate that DRM testing targeted participants with VL ≥1000 copies/ml, which represents virological failure while on ART. Thus the sequences generated came from individuals experiencing viraemia (virological failure) on treatment."
37938856,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — the study was a pre/post-intervention prospective cohort study, not a randomized clinical trial.","We conducted an open-label, pre/post-intervention (or intervention/control) prospective cohort study, enrolling pregnant women ... from February 2019 to November 2022. Ours is the first study to combine VL with DRM testing in optimizing VS among pregnant and postpartum women; however, it has limitations. First, Opt4Mamas could not be pursued as a randomized clinical trial as a limitation of its funding source.","The manuscript repeatedly characterizes the design as a pre/post-intervention prospective cohort with contemporaneous control and intervention groups, and explicitly notes it was not a randomized clinical trial; therefore participants were not part of a randomized clinical trial."
37938856,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes — most participants were on ART at enrolment and DRM testing was performed on viraemic individuals who had prior ART exposure.,"We enrolled women ... on ART or planning to initiate ART within 1 week. Overall, 622 (76%) participants were on NNRTI-, 71 (8.7%) on PI- and 80 (10%) on integrase-containing ART at enrolment. In the intervention group ... 46 DRM tests were successfully conducted and all identified at least one DRM (K103N and M184V were most commonly detected mutations).","Eligibility and enrolment data show that the majority of participants were on antiretroviral therapy at enrolment. DRM testing was performed on participants with viral failure while on ART, so the sequences reported derive from individuals with prior ARV exposure."
37938856,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs).","First-line ART regimens among adults during the study period included combinations of two nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) lamivudine and tenofovir with either (1) NNRTI efavirenz or (2) integrase inhibitors (INSTIs) dolutegravir, and protease inhibitors (PIs)-containing ART, for example with atazanavir/ritonavir, were considered alternative first-line or second-line regimens. Overall, 622 (76%) participants were on NNRTI-, 71 (8.7%) on PI- and 80 (10%) on integrase-containing ART at enrolment.","The Methods describe the ART regimens in use in the study population, listing NRTI backbone and the classes NNRTI, INSTI and PI; participant baseline data quantify the proportions on NNRTI-, PI- and INSTI-containing regimens, confirming exposure to these classes prior to sequencing."
37938856,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Specific drugs mentioned include lamivudine and tenofovir (NRTIs), efavirenz (NNRTI), dolutegravir (INSTI), and atazanavir/ritonavir (PI).","First-line ART regimens among adults during the study period included combinations of two nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) lamivudine and tenofovir with either (1) NNRTI efavirenz or (2) integrase inhibitors (INSTIs) dolutegravir, and protease inhibitors (PIs)-containing ART, for example with atazanavir/ritonavir, were considered alternative first-line or second-line regimens. Overall, 622 (76%) participants were on NNRTI-, 71 (8.7%) on PI- and 80 (10%) on integrase-containing ART at enrolment.","The manuscript explicitly names lamivudine and tenofovir as the common NRTI backbone and gives examples of NNRTI (efavirenz), INSTI (dolutegravir) and PI (atazanavir/ritonavir) used in the population, indicating these specific drugs were received by participants prior to sequencing."
37941373,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,"Yes. The study reports sequencing of the HIV-1 integrase (IN) gene from patient plasma samples, generating integrase sequence data for 1,032 patients.",Integrase sequence data was harvested for a comprehensive cohort of 1032 patients infected with HIV-1. The HIV-1 IN gene was amplified by a validated In-house method.,"The methods and abstract explicitly state that plasma samples were collected and the IN portion of the pol gene was amplified and sequenced, and that integrase sequence data were obtained for 1,032 patients. These statements indicate that sequences were generated from patient samples."
37941373,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,"No. The paper reports genotypic resistance analysis using sequencing and Stanford HIVdb interpretation, not in vitro phenotypic susceptibility assays.","Then, sequences were subjected to the regularly updated Stanford HIV-1 Drug Resistance Database ( http://hivdb.stanford.edu/ ) to analyse INSTI drug resistance mutations and antiretroviral susceptibility. In the limitations: Sanger dideoxy sequencing was employed for the identification of the clinically significant known drug resistance mutations.",The paper describes genotypic sequencing and interpretation via Stanford HIVdb to infer susceptibility levels; it does not describe any cell-culture or phenotypic (in vitro) susceptibility testing. The methods and limitations explicitly reference genotypic/Sanger sequencing and database-based interpretation rather than phenotypic assays.
37941373,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No. The paper does not report public deposition; data are available from the first author on reasonable request.,The data in this study are available from the first author (HZ.Z) on reasonable request. There is no mention of GenBank or other public sequence repository accession numbers in the manuscript.,"The Data Availability statement explicitly indicates data are available on request and no GenBank accession numbers or repository deposits are provided elsewhere in the text, so sequences were not made publicly available in a repository according to the paper."
37941373,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,The data in this study are available from the first author (HZ.Z) on reasonable request.

37941373,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,The integrase (IN) region of the pol gene was sequenced (partial pol encoding integrase).,"amplification, sequence, and analysis of the portion of the HIV-1 pol gene that encodes the integrase protein were implemented to identify INSTI resistance. The HIV-1 IN gene was amplified by a validated In-house method.","The manuscript repeatedly states that the IN portion of the pol gene was the target for amplification and sequencing to detect INSTI-associated resistance mutations, indicating only the integrase gene was sequenced."
37941373,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Nested RT-PCR amplification of the IN gene followed by Sanger (dideoxy) sequencing using an in-house validated method.,The first round of PCR was completed utilizing the HiScript®II one-step RT-PCR kit. The second round was implemented with the help of an Ace Taq kit for nested PCR amplification of target sequences. In the limitations: Sanger dideoxy sequencing was employed for the identification of the clinically significant known drug resistance mutations.,"The methods detail an in-house nested RT-PCR approach to amplify the integrase fragment and the discussion/limitations state that Sanger dideoxy sequencing was used, so sequencing was done by Sanger on nested PCR products."
37941373,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,"Plasma samples (viral RNA extracted from plasma) from patients with HIV-1 viral load >1,000 copies/ml were sequenced.","Plasma samples were collected from patients with HIV-1 viral load (VL) greater than 1,000 copies/ml and subjected to a subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the IN gene. HIV-RNA was extracted utilizing a viral nucleic acid extraction kit... then plasma (supernatant) was harvested for RNA extraction.","The methods describe collection of EDTA whole blood, centrifugation to obtain plasma, extraction of viral RNA from plasma, and amplification of the IN gene, indicating plasma-derived viral RNA was the sequenced material."

37896860,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"Yes — DRT was targeted to individuals with virologic failure (VL ≥ 1000 copies/mL), and the DRT results reported are from those with VF.","Children were randomized ... to the control (standard-of-care) or intervention (point-of-care viral load (POC VL) testing every three months with targeted genotypic drug resistance testing (DRT) for virologic failure (VF) (≥1000 copies/mL)). During the 12-month study period, 190 study DRTs were requested for 106 (15%) participants across the two study groups.","The study design specified targeted DRT for episodes of virologic failure (≥1000 copies/mL), and the Results describe the DRTs requested and performed for participants with VF, indicating sequences were obtained from individuals experiencing virological failure while on ART."
37896860,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,Yes — participants were enrolled in the Opt4Kids randomized controlled trial.,"The Optimizing Viral Suppression in Children on ART in Kenya (Opt4Kids) study protocol and primary findings have been described previously. In brief, 704 CHIV ages 1--14 years were enrolled from 5 public facilities in Kisumu County, Kenya, between March and December 2019 and were followed for 12 months. Children were individually randomized 1:1, stratified by site and age groups ... to the control (standard-of-care) or intervention groups ...","The manuscript describes a randomized 1:1 study design (Opt4Kids) with control and intervention arms and 12-month follow-up, indicating this was a clinical trial."
37896860,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes — participants were on ART (on or initiating ART) and many had prior ARV exposure at time of sequencing.,"Children 1--14 years of age, enrolled at a study site, on or initiating ART, and with a consenting caregiver were enrolled to the study. Overall, 382 (54.3%) of the participants were on an NNRTI-containing regimen at study enrollment, 294 (41.8%) were on a PI-containing regimen, 27 (3.8%) were on an INSTI-containing regimen, and 1 (0.1%) was on a PI and INSTI regimen (Table 1).","The study population included children already on ART and the Results enumerate the ART regimens participants were receiving at enrollment, indicating that sequences were obtained from individuals with prior/current ARV exposure."
37896860,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"NRTIs, NNRTIs, protease inhibitors (PIs), and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) were received by participants (with NRTI-containing backbones and NNRTI, PI, and INSTI regimens noted).","Overall, 382 (54.3%) of the participants were on an NNRTI-containing regimen at study enrollment, 294 (41.8%) were on a PI-containing regimen, 27 (3.8%) were on an INSTI-containing regimen, and 1 (0.1%) was on a PI and INSTI regimen (Table 1). First-line ART regimens in Kenya during the study period for children included lamivudine with either abacavir (preferred) or zidovudine (alternative) and lopinavir/ritonavir for those less than three years of age and lamivudine with either abacavir (preferred) or zidovudine (alternative) and efavirenz for those three years of age and older.","The Results and Study Setting describe the ART regimens in use and percentages on NNRTI-, PI-, and INSTI-containing regimens; the Study Setting also describes NRTI backbones, indicating receipt of NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs, and INSTIs among participants prior to/at the time of sequencing."

Over half of those with DRT results demonstrated DR to abacavir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, efavirenz, and nevirapine, while over 10% had resistance to zidovudine and tenofovir. DR to newer-generation NNRTIs was also high, with 43.5% having DR to rilpivirine and fewer having DR to etravirine (66.0%) and doravirine (20.0%).","The Study Setting lists the common drugs used in pediatric regimens (lamivudine, abacavir, zidovudine, lopinavir/ritonavir, efavirenz, and the roll-out of dolutegravir), and the Results describe observed resistance patterns to specific drugs (abacavir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, efavirenz, nevirapine, zidovudine, tenofovir, rilpivirine, etravirine, doravirine), confirming these drugs were received by participants prior to/at sequencing."
37957382,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes. The study reports single-genome near-full-length proviral sequences and plasma HIV-1 RNA sequences from participants.,"We analyzed plasma virus sequences in eight ART-treated individuals with NSV (88% male) and show that they are composed of large clones without evidence of viral evolution over time in those with longitudinal samples. A total of 1,987 single-genome proviral sequences and 222 single-genome plasma sequences were generated for the eight participants with NSV.","The abstract and main text explicitly state that plasma virus sequences were analyzed. The Results state that 1,987 proviral and 222 plasma single-genome sequences were generated for the eight participants, indicating that HIV sequences from patient samples were obtained and analyzed."
37957382,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,"No. The paper reports genotypic resistance scoring and viral outgrowth assays, but it does not report classical in vitro phenotypic drug susceptibility assays.","For each sequence, the GSS versus the participants' ART regimen was calculated using the Stanford HIV database drug resistance scoring system. To evaluate whether these proviruses were infectious, viral outgrowth assays (VOAs) were performed using a transwell system with participant CD4+ T cells (LV4, LV7 and LV8; LV2, LV5 and LV9 served as controls) in the bottom chamber and MOLT-4/CCR5 cells in the upper chamber.","The Methods describe calculation of genotypic susceptibility scores (GSS) from sequence data and performance of VOAs to test for recoverable infectious virus, but there is no description of phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (for example, phenotypic IC50/EC50 assays against ARVs). Therefore, standard in vitro drug susceptibility data were not reported."
37957382,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,Yes. Sequence data were submitted to GenBank under BioProject PRJNA973660.,Sequence data were submitted to Genbank (BioProject: PRJNA973660 ).

All data and code are available by request to the authors and the AIDS Clinical Trials Group.,"The Data availability statement gives the BioProject accession (PRJNA973660) but no specific per-sequence GenBank accession numbers are listed in the excerpt. Individual accession numbers may be available within the GenBank BioProject record or upon request, but they are not provided in the paper text shown."
37957382,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Eight participants with non-suppressible viremia had samples sequenced.,"We enrolled eight participants with ongoing NSV, 88% men, with a median age of 60 years and median ART duration of 10 years. A total of 1,987 single-genome proviral sequences and 222 single-genome plasma sequences were generated for the eight participants with NSV.","The Methods and Results repeatedly state that eight ART-treated participants with NSV were enrolled and that the reported proviral and plasma sequences were generated for those eight participants, indicating eight individuals were sequenced."
37957382,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not explicitly stated in the provided text (country not specified).,"A participant with non-suppressible viremia enrolled in the HIV Eradication and Latency (HEAL) cohort, a biorepository of Brigham and Women's Hospital, was included as a part of eight NSVs. The ART-suppressed comparators included 11 participants from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) and 7 participants from the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard.","The manuscript notes institutional cohorts and U.S.-based centers (Brigham and Women's Hospital, ACTG, Ragon Institute), but it does not explicitly state the country/countries of origin for the sequenced samples in the provided content. Therefore the country is not specified directly in the text excerpt."
37957382,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,The calendar years of sample collection are not specified in the provided text.,"The NSV samples were taken from different time points, enabling us to study these participants longitudinally (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1). We enrolled eight participants with ongoing NSV, ... with a median ART duration of 10 years.","While the paper describes longitudinal sampling and clinical durations (for example, median ART duration), it does not provide explicit calendar years or dates for sample collection in the provided content, so the years cannot be determined from this text."
37957382,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No. The study used limiting-dilution single-genome PCR (endpoint dilution) for near-full-length sequencing rather than cloning.,"Extracted DNA was endpoint-diluted and subjected to near full-length sequencing (NFL-seq), as previously described. Extracted RNA was diluted to single viral genome levels to meet the criteria of single-genome sequencing of having no more than one template in each well, theoretically no more than 25% of wells being positive for HIV.","The Methods describe endpoint dilution and single-genome sequencing to ensure one template per reaction, which is a single-genome PCR approach rather than cloning of amplicons into vectors prior to sequencing. Therefore samples were not cloned prior to sequencing; they used single-genome amplification/NGS."
37957382,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Near-full-length proviral genomes were sequenced and plasma sequencing targeted a 6.7 kb pol–env region; analyses referenced genes including pol, env, gag and nef (and whole genome regions).","Longitudinal single-genome sequencing of near-full-length proviruses and plasma HIV-1 pol-env RNA was performed. Primers were designed to amplify pol-env, a 6.7-kb region (Supplementary Data 1).","The paper reports near-full-length proviral sequencing (which covers the full set of HIV genes) and specifically targeted a 6.7-kb pol–env amplicon for plasma RNA, and downstream analyses extract individual genes (e.g., pol, gag, env, nef) for escape mutation and other gene-specific analyses."
37957382,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Single-genome near-full-length PCR (NFL-seq) with Illumina MiSeq library construction and assembly; MIP-seq was used to link proviral sequences to integration sites.,"Extracted DNA was endpoint-diluted and subjected to near full-length sequencing (NFL-seq), as previously described. Products underwent Illumina barcoded library construction and MiSeq sequencing. Using the Matched Integration Site and Proviral Sequencing (MIP-seq) protocol, we identified host chromosomal integration sites for producer, non-producer and defective proviruses.","The Methods describe limiting-dilution single-genome near-full-length PCR followed by Illumina MiSeq sequencing and de novo assembly; additionally, MIP-seq was employed to obtain matched integration-site and proviral sequence information. These combined approaches define the sequencing methodologies used."
37957382,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma HIV-1 RNA (plasma samples) and proviral DNA from PBMCs/CD4+ T cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) were sequenced; CD4+ cells were also used for RNA-seq and MIP-seq integration-site analyses.,"A total of 1,987 single-genome proviral sequences and 222 single-genome plasma sequences were generated for the eight participants with NSV. DNA extractions were carried out from PBMCs using the QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (cat. no. 56304), and the quantification of DNA was performed with Nanodrop.","The Results and Methods explicitly state that plasma HIV-1 RNA was sequenced (plasma sequences) and that proviral DNA was extracted from PBMCs (including CD4+ T cells) for near-full-length sequencing and integration-site analyses, indicating these sample types were sequenced."
37957382,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"Yes. Sequences were obtained from individuals with persistent low-level viremia while on ART (non-suppressible viremia), i.e., viremia despite being on antiretroviral therapy.","We enrolled eight participants with ongoing NSV ... During the NSV episodes, the median viral load was 143 copies ml−1 and the median CD4 count was 798 cells µl−1. While the ART regimen was adjusted during the NSV for some participants, virologic suppression was not achieved.","The cohort consists of ART-treated participants who had persistent low-level viremia (NSV) despite being on ART. The study generated proviral and plasma sequences from these individuals, so sequences were obtained from persons with ongoing viremia while receiving treatment (persistent virologic detection despite ART)."
37957382,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No. The participants were enrolled in an observational study (with some comparators from cohort sources), not a clinical trial.","In an observational study, we enrolled 8 ART-treated participants with three or more HIV-1 RNA levels between 40 and 1,000 copies ml−1 over 24 months. All study participants provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board.","The Methods explicitly describe this as an observational study and refer to cohort sources (HEAL, ACTG, Ragon) rather than enrollment in a prospective interventional clinical trial, indicating participants were not in a clinical trial for this study."
37957382,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes. All participants were ART-treated with a median ART duration of 10 years and were receiving at least two active antiretroviral drugs during NSV episodes.,We enrolled eight participants with ongoing NSV ... with a median ART duration of 10 years. All participants were receiving at least two active antiretroviral drugs during the NSV episodes.,The participant characteristics explicitly state ART exposure and ongoing ART during the NSV episodes; therefore the sequences derive from individuals who had previously and were currently receiving antiretroviral drugs.
37957382,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Participants received drugs from multiple classes including nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs).","Antiretroviral resistance mutations from both clinical testing and the largest plasma clone from single-genome sequencing are shown in the table insert. The figure legend lists RPV, TDF, FTC, ATV/r, TAF, DTG, DRV/r; ... NRTI, NNRTI, IN, PI.","Drug names and class abbreviations are listed in the figure legends and text (e.g., TDF/TAF and FTC are NRTIs; RPV is an NNRTI; ATV/r and DRV/r are PIs; DTG is an integrase inhibitor), indicating that participants had received drugs from these major ARV classes."
37957382,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Drugs mentioned in the paper include dolutegravir (DTG), darunavir (DRV/r), darunavir/ritonavir, atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r), rilpivirine (RPV), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), and emtricitabine (FTC).","LV1 and LV2 had plasma dolutegravir and darunavir concentrations consistent with ongoing ART use (Supplementary Table 5). The figure legend lists RPV, TDF, FTC, ATV/r, TAF, DTG, DRV/r.","The manuscript names specific antiretroviral drugs detected/measured (DTG, DRV, ATV/r, RPV, TDF, TAF, FTC) and uses their abbreviations in figures and methods, indicating that these were among the drugs received by participants prior to or during the sampling that yielded the sequences."
37946329,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,"Yes.

This directly indicates that HIV sequences from patient samples were generated and analyzed."
37946329,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No. The paper reports genotypic resistance testing and predicted resistance via the Stanford HIVdb rather than in vitro phenotypic (cell-based) susceptibility assays.,"Genotypic drug resistance testing was performed as described previously. DRMs and antiretroviral susceptibility were analyzed by submitting the identified sequences to the Stanford HIV-1 drug resistance database (http://hivdb.stanford.edu/), which is updated periodically.","The paper describes genotypic testing and computational/ database-based prediction of susceptibility (Stanford HIVdb). There is no mention of laboratory phenotypic assays or in vitro susceptibility testing (e.g., phenotypic IC50/EC50 measurements), so no in vitro drug susceptibility data were reported."
37946329,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,"Not explicitly reported. The paper states sequences were submitted to the Stanford HIVdb for analysis, but it does not state that raw sequences were deposited in public sequence repositories (e.g., GenBank) or provide accession numbers.","DRMs and antiretroviral susceptibility were analyzed by submitting the identified sequences to the Stanford HIV-1 drug resistance database (http://hivdb.stanford.edu/), which is updated periodically. No GenBank accession numbers or statement of sequence deposition in public repositories are provided in the manuscript text.","While submission to Stanford HIVdb for analysis is described, the manuscript does not include language indicating deposition of sequences in public sequence archives nor lists accession numbers. Therefore public availability via standard repositories is not documented in the text."
37946329,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,No GenBank accession numbers are reported in the paper.,"DRMs and antiretroviral susceptibility were analyzed by submitting the identified sequences to the Stanford HIV-1 drug resistance database (http://hivdb.stanford.edu/), which is updated periodically.

Pol typically encompasses protease and reverse transcriptase regions used for DRM analysis.
37946329,10,What method was used for sequencing?,"The specific sequencing platform or method is not described in the manuscript; genotypic drug resistance testing was performed as described in prior references, but no explicit sequencing technique (e.g., Sanger or NGS) is stated.","The partial polymerase (pol) and complete integrase gene-coding sequences were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed to identify DRMs. Genotypic drug resistance testing was performed as described previously.","Although sequencing is reported, the paper refers to prior methods for genotypic testing and does not specify whether Sanger sequencing, next-generation sequencing, or another method was used. Therefore the exact sequencing method cannot be determined from the provided text."
37946329,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma samples derived from people living with HIV (blood-derived plasma) were used for sequencing.,"The DRM status ... was assessed based on analysis of plasma samples derived from PLWH in the Sixth People's Hospital of Zhengzhou from June 2018 to April 2022.

This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Sixth People's Hospital of Zhengzhou (No. 2019-04). All participants signed written informed consent before sample collection.,"The manuscript describes an observational assessment of routine clinic patients, ethics approval, and informed consent but contains no description of a clinical trial protocol, randomization, or trial registration. Therefore patients were not reported as participants in a clinical trial."
37946329,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"Yes.

37966701,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Zero — no samples were obtained for HIV sequencing as part of this study.,"Four confirmed virologic failures were observed over a range of 6--36 weeks after the first injections, three of which resulted in CAB + RPV LA discontinuation; resistance data were not available. A total of 321 individuals received at least one continuation CAB + RPV LA injection during the study period.","While the study enrolled 321 individuals for CAB+RPV LA injections, the paper explicitly states that resistance data were not available and does not describe any sequencing efforts. Therefore no individuals had samples obtained for sequencing in this report."
37966701,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable — no sequenced samples. The study population was from the United States (18 US states and territories).,"This study was conducted with data from the Observational Pharmaco-Epidemiology Research & Analysis (OPERA®) cohort, which consists of prospectively captured, routine clinical data from electronic health records from 84 clinics in 18 US states and territories. In this large US cohort of routine clinical HIV care, monthly CAB + RPV LA injectable was associated with high levels of virologic control.",There were no sequenced samples to attribute to any country. The paper does state the study population and data source are from the US (multiple states and territories).
37966701,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Not applicable — no sequencing was performed. The study period for injections was January 21, 2021 to March 15, 2022 (first injection window through continuation injections).","From the OPERA® cohort, all adults with HIV who received their first CAB + RPV LA injection and ≥ 1 continuation injections between 21 January 2021 and 15 March 2022 were included. A total of 321 individuals received at least one continuation CAB + RPV LA injection during the study period.","No sequencing was reported. The only dates provided relate to the study enrollment and follow-up window for injections (2021–2022), which is the relevant timeframe described in the paper."
37966701,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,"Not applicable — no sequencing was performed, therefore no cloning was reported.","Resistance data were not available. This study was conducted with data from the Observational Pharmaco-Epidemiology Research & Analysis (OPERA®) cohort, which consists of prospectively captured, routine clinical data from electronic health records from 84 clinics in 18 US states and territories.","There is no mention of laboratory methods, cloning, or sequencing procedures in the manuscript; the study used EHR data and explicitly notes the unavailability of resistance data, so cloning prior to sequencing did not occur or is not reported."
37966701,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,None — the paper does not report any sequenced HIV genes.,Resistance data were not available. The paper does not describe sequencing methods or any gene targets; it focuses on administration adherence and virologic outcomes in routine care.,"No sequencing is described and no gene targets (e.g., pol, env) are mentioned anywhere in the manuscript, therefore no HIV genes were reported as sequenced."
37966701,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not applicable — no sequencing methods are reported because sequencing was not performed.,Resistance data were not available. The manuscript describes use of electronic health record data from the OPERA cohort and does not include laboratory sequencing methods.,"There is no description of sequencing workflows, platforms, or protocols in the paper; the absence of resistance data indicates sequencing was not part of this study."
37966701,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Not applicable — no biological samples were sequenced. The study used electronic health record data from routine clinical care.,"This study was conducted with data from the Observational Pharmaco-Epidemiology Research & Analysis (OPERA®) cohort, which consists of prospectively captured, routine clinical data from electronic health records from 84 clinics in 18 US states and territories. The datasets used in this study are not publicly available due to privacy concerns and the proprietary nature of the database but can be accessed upon reasonable request.","The paper is an observational analysis of EHR-derived clinical data and explicitly indicates resistance data were unavailable; it does not report sequencing of plasma, PBMCs, or other biological specimens."
37966701,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No — although four confirmed virologic failures occurred, resistance data/sequences were not available or reported.","Four confirmed virologic failures were observed over a range of 6--36 weeks after the first injections, three of which resulted in CAB + RPV LA discontinuation; resistance data were not available. Another study limitation was the unavailability of resistance testing results for analysis, which could have an impact on virologic effectiveness.","The paper documents four virologic failures but explicitly states that resistance testing results were unavailable, so no sequences were obtained or reported from those individuals."
37966701,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — patients were part of an observational cohort (routine clinical care, OPERA), not a clinical trial.","This study was conducted with data from the Observational Pharmaco-Epidemiology Research & Analysis (OPERA®) cohort, which consists of prospectively captured, routine clinical data from electronic health records from 84 clinics in 18 US states and territories. In routine clinical care in the US, 90% of monthly CAB + RPV LA continuation injections were administered on time, or within 7 days before or after the target date, as per the label.","The manuscript repeatedly frames the work as an observational, real-world assessment using EHR data from the OPERA cohort; it does not describe randomization, trial protocols, or clinical-trial enrollment, so this was not a clinical trial."
37966701,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"No — the paper does not report any HIV sequences, including from individuals with prior ARV exposure.","CAB + RPV LA injectable was approved in the US for HIV-1 treatment in individuals on a stable antiretroviral regimen with a viral load < 50 copies/mL, no treatment failure history, and no resistance to either cabotegravir or rilpivirine. Resistance data were not available.","Although the cohort includes individuals who were already on antiretroviral therapy (many were virologically suppressed at initiation), the study did not perform or report sequencing, so no sequences from previously treated individuals are presented."
37966701,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not applicable for sequencing. The regimen studied was cabotegravir + rilpivirine long-acting (ART), but the paper does not report sequencing nor provide a breakdown of prior drug classes received before sequencing.","The first complete long-acting antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen, cabotegravir + rilpivirine long-acting (CAB + RPV LA) injectable, was approved in the US for HIV-1 treatment in individuals on a stable antiretroviral regimen with a viral load < 50 copies/mL, no treatment failure history, and no resistance to either cabotegravir or rilpivirine. A total of 321 individuals received at least one continuation CAB + RPV LA injection during the study period.",The paper describes use of the CAB+RPV LA regimen (an ART regimen) but does not report sequencing or list the classes of prior antiretrovirals received by participants in the context of sequencing. Therefore the question about drug classes received prior to sequencing is not applicable given no sequencing was done; the study drug regimen itself is reported.
37966701,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not applicable for sequencing. The study reports participants received cabotegravir and rilpivirine long-acting injections, but no sequencing was performed and prior specific drugs (pre-sequencing) are not detailed.","The first complete long-acting antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen, cabotegravir + rilpivirine long-acting (CAB + RPV LA) injectable, was approved in the US for HIV-1 treatment... A total of 321 individuals received at least one continuation CAB + RPV LA injection during the study period.","While the paper clearly documents that participants received cabotegravir plus rilpivirine long-acting injections, it contains no sequencing data or information about sequences tied to specific prior drugs. Thus there are no reported sequenced samples from which to attribute prior drug exposures."
37973713,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes. The paper reports HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase coding region sequences obtained from patients using Sanger sequencing.,"The drug resistance genotyping of HIV-1 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) coding region was performed based on a Sanger sequencing method with use of commercially available ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System (Abbott Molecular, Des Plains, IL, USA). We have conducted multi-center, prospective study, which aimed to establish HIV-1 subtype and assess the presence of primary drug resistance mutations to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors in antiretroviral treatment naïve patients.","The Methods explicitly state that genotyping of PR and RT coding regions was performed by Sanger sequencing on patient-derived samples using a commercial HIV genotyping system, and the study objective was to assess primary drug resistance mutations in patients, which implies sequencing of patient viral samples."
37973713,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No. The paper reports genotypic resistance data but does not present in vitro (phenotypic) susceptibility testing results.,"The sequences were submitted to the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database (http://hivdb.stanford.edu) in order to comparison of potential differences in the interpretation of the significance of genetic variants detected. We haven't recognized increased percentage of DRMs associated with clinical (phenotypical) resistance to ART, but we have detected mutations triggering reduced response to ART in almost half (44%) of the recruited patients, which support increasing concern about the emergence of HIV DRMs.",The paper describes genotypic sequencing and database-based interpretation (Stanford HIVDB) but does not describe any laboratory phenotypic (in vitro) susceptibility assays or report phenotypic susceptibility values; the discussion contrasts genotypic findings with phenotypic resistance but no phenotypic testing was reported.
37973713,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,"Partially. Sequences were submitted to the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database, but no public GenBank accession numbers are reported.",The sequences were submitted to the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database (http://hivdb.stanford.edu) in order to comparison of potential differences in the interpretation of the significance of genetic variants detected. For HIV-1 subtype and circular recombinant forms (CRFs) determination of partial pol submitted sequences REGA HIV-1 Subtyping Tool Version 3.0 was used.,"The paper states sequence submission to the Stanford HIVDB and use of REGA for subtyping, indicating sharing with those tools/databases, but the manuscript does not report deposits to GenBank or provide GenBank accession numbers; therefore sequences were made available to/interpreted via HIVDB but no GenBank public accession identifiers are given."
37973713,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported. The paper does not provide any GenBank accession numbers.,The sequences were submitted to the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database (http://hivdb.stanford.edu) in order to comparison of potential differences in the interpretation of the significance of genetic variants detected. Because of the lack of the results of genotyping in 34 individuals they were excluded from the analysis.,"Although the authors state they submitted sequences to Stanford HIVDB, the manuscript contains no GenBank accession identifiers or list of accession numbers; therefore no GenBank accessions are reported in the paper."
37973713,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,"83 individuals had genotyping results (117 recruited, 34 excluded for lack of genotyping results).",The inclusion and exclusion criteria met 117 patients. Because of the lack of the results of genotyping in 34 individuals they were excluded from the analysis.,The manuscript states 117 patients were recruited and explicitly notes that 34 individuals lacked genotyping results and were excluded. Subtracting those excluded (34) from recruited (117) yields 83 individuals with sequencing/genotyping results.
37973713,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Poland, Ukraine, and a small number from Belarus, Georgia, and Kazakhstan.","In the study group there were 61 patients (52.14%) from eastern countries and 56 patients (47.86%) from Poland. Among patients from eastern countries there were 58 patients (95.08%) from Ukraine (11 war refugees and 47 patients who arrived to Poland before the onset of war), 3 patients (4.92%) from: Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan.","The Results specify the geographic origin of participants: the cohort included Polish patients and patients from eastern countries predominantly Ukraine, with three additional patients from Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan."
37973713,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Samples were obtained during 2020–2022.,"We have conducted multi-center, prospective, observational, cross sectional study. The patients were recruited during 2 years period (2020--2022).",Both the Abstract and Methods state that recruitment (and thus sample collection for sequencing) occurred over the two-year period 2020–2022.
37973713,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No. There is no indication that samples were cloned prior to sequencing; Sanger sequencing with ViroSeq was used.,"The drug resistance genotyping of HIV-1 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) coding region was performed based on a Sanger sequencing method with use of commercially available ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System (Abbott Molecular, Des Plains, IL, USA). We haven't performed genotyping to asses HIV sub-subtypes (including A6-a risk factor of increased virological failure to InSTI).",The Methods describe direct Sanger genotyping using a commercial kit and do not mention molecular cloning of PCR products or cloning-based sequencing; therefore samples were not cloned prior to sequencing (or at least cloning is not reported).
37973713,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,Protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) coding regions (partial pol region).,"The drug resistance genotyping of HIV-1 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) coding region was performed based on a Sanger sequencing method with use of commercially available ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System (Abbott Molecular, Des Plains, IL, USA). For HIV-1 subtype and circular recombinant forms (CRFs) determination of partial pol submitted sequences REGA HIV-1 Subtyping Tool Version 3.0 was used.","The Methods explicitly name PR and RT coding regions as targets of genotyping and refer to the sequences as partial pol, which includes protease and reverse transcriptase."
37973713,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Sanger sequencing using the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System (Abbott Molecular).,"The drug resistance genotyping of HIV-1 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) coding region was performed based on a Sanger sequencing method with use of commercially available ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System (Abbott Molecular, Des Plains, IL, USA). The sequences were submitted to the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database (http://hivdb.stanford.edu) in order to comparison of potential differences in the interpretation of the significance of genetic variants detected.",The Methods clearly state Sanger sequencing and the specific commercial genotyping kit used (ViroSeq).
37973713,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Viral RNA from peripheral blood (plasma) was sequenced (implied by HIV-RNA viral load measurements and use of standard genotyping workflows).,"The HIV-1 viral loads (VL) were measured by real time PCR system (Abbott). Undetectable viral load was defined as a < 50 copies of HIV-RNA/ml of the peripheral blood and virological failure was defined as a detectable HIV-1 viral load after 6 months from the initiation of the ART. The drug resistance genotyping of HIV-1 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) coding region was performed based on a Sanger sequencing method with use of commercially available ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System (Abbott Molecular, Des Plains, IL, USA).","Although the paper does not explicitly state 'plasma' was sequenced, it describes measurement of HIV-RNA in peripheral blood and standard genotypic testing (ViroSeq) which is performed on viral RNA from plasma; thus sequencing was performed on patient peripheral blood/plasma-derived viral RNA."
37973713,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No. All sequenced individuals were antiretroviral treatment–naïve at sampling, so sequences were not from cases of virological failure on therapy.","Inclusion criteria were recent diagnosis with HIV-1 infection (newly recognized patients), no history of ART, age 18 years or older. We have conducted multi-center, prospective study, which aimed to establish HIV-1 subtype and assess the presence of primary drug resistance mutations to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors in antiretroviral treatment naïve patients.","The study specifically recruited newly diagnosed, ART-naïve patients and genotyping was performed before ART initiation, so sequences did not come from individuals experiencing treatment-related virological failure."
37973713,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,Yes. The study was registered as a clinical trial (NCT04636736) and received bioethics approval.,"The clinical trial received a positive opinion from the Bioethics Committee at the Medical University of Warsaw (Number of consent: AKBE/206/2020) and was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (Number: NCT04636736 ). We have conducted multi-center, prospective, observational, cross sectional study.","The Methods state the study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov with an NCT number and had ethical committee approval, indicating it was conducted under a registered clinical trial framework."
37973713,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No. The paper reports sequences from individuals with no prior history of antiretroviral therapy.,"Inclusion criteria were recent diagnosis with HIV-1 infection (newly recognized patients), no history of ART, age 18 years or older. We have conducted multi-center, prospective study, which aimed to establish HIV-1 subtype and assess the presence of primary drug resistance mutations ... in antiretroviral treatment naïve patients.",The inclusion criteria explicitly required no prior ART; therefore sequences originate from ART-naïve individuals and not from previously treated patients.
37973713,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,None. Individuals were ART-naïve and had not received any antiretroviral drug classes prior to sequencing.,"Inclusion criteria were recent diagnosis with HIV-1 infection (newly recognized patients), no history of ART, age 18 years or older. We have conducted multi-center, prospective study, which aimed to establish HIV-1 subtype and assess the presence of primary drug resistance mutations ... in antiretroviral treatment naïve patients.","Because the cohort was defined as antiretroviral treatment–naïve, participants had not received NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs, INSTIs or any other ARV class before sequencing."
37973713,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,None. No individual had received antiretroviral drugs prior to sequencing.,"Inclusion criteria were recent diagnosis with HIV-1 infection (newly recognized patients), no history of ART, age 18 years or older. We have conducted multi-center, prospective study, which aimed to establish HIV-1 subtype and assess the presence of primary drug resistance mutations ... in antiretroviral treatment naïve patients.","The study enrolled ART-naïve patients by design, so no specific antiretroviral drugs were administered to the participants before the sequencing was performed."
37976185,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,"HIV-related laboratory results (CD4 cell count, HIV viral load [VL], and HIV-1 genotype sequences (Sanger or consensus sequences when next-generation sequencing is conducted)) are reported to the health department and stored in the Registry and laboratory databases. We included people with HIV newly diagnosed between 2015 and 2022, assigned for partner services, for whom a genotype obtained within 30 days of diagnosis was available in the NYC HIV Surveillance Registry.",The Methods state that HIV-1 genotype sequences are reported to and stored in the NYC Registry and that the analytic population was defined by having a genotype obtained within 30 days of diagnosis. These statements indicate that HIV sequences from patient samples were reported and used in the study.
37976185,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No.,"HIV-related laboratory results (CD4 cell count, HIV viral load [VL], and HIV-1 genotype sequences (Sanger or consensus sequences when next-generation sequencing is conducted)) are reported to the health department and stored in the Registry and laboratory databases. Resistance associated mutations were determined using the Stanford algorithm.",The paper describes genotypic sequencing and interpretation of resistance-associated mutations via the Stanford algorithm but does not describe any phenotypic or in vitro susceptibility assays or results. The absence of methods or results describing laboratory susceptibility testing supports the conclusion that no in vitro drug susceptibility data were reported.
37976185,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,Not reported / No indication in the paper that sequences were made publicly available.,"HIV-related laboratory results (CD4 cell count, HIV viral load [VL], and HIV-1 genotype sequences (Sanger or consensus sequences when next-generation sequencing is conducted)) are reported to the health department and stored in the Registry and laboratory databases. We included people with HIV newly diagnosed between 2015 and 2022, assigned for partner services, for whom a genotype obtained within 30 days of diagnosis was available in the NYC HIV Surveillance Registry.","The manuscript describes internal reporting and storage of genotype sequences in the NYC HIV Surveillance Registry and laboratory databases but does not mention deposition of sequences in public repositories (e.g., GenBank) or provide accession numbers. Therefore, public availability of sequences is not reported."
37976185,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None provided / Not reported.,"HIV-related laboratory results (CD4 cell count, HIV viral load [VL], and HIV-1 genotype sequences (Sanger or consensus sequences when next-generation sequencing is conducted)) are reported to the health department and stored in the Registry and laboratory databases. The manuscript does not list GenBank accession numbers or reference deposition of sequences in public databases.","The paper details that genotypes are stored in the NYC Registry but does not provide any GenBank accession numbers or statements of sequence deposition. In absence of such information, no accession numbers are available from the text."
37976185,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,4246 individuals had an available genotype obtained within 30 days of diagnosis.,"Of 10 356 people with a new HIV diagnosis assigned for partner services in this time period, a total of 4246 (40%) had an available genotype obtained within 30 days of diagnosis and comprised our analytic population.

37976185,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,United States (New York City).,"We used New York City surveillance and partner services data to measure the effect of PrEP use ... in people with HIV diagnosed in 2015--2022. We included people with HIV newly diagnosed between 2015 and 2022, assigned for partner services, for whom a genotype obtained within 30 days of diagnosis was available in the NYC HIV Surveillance Registry.","The study population is derived from New York City surveillance and partner services data; therefore, the sequenced samples come from people diagnosed in New York City, United States. No other countries are mentioned as sources of samples."
37976185,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,2015–2022.,"We used New York City surveillance and partner services data to measure the effect of PrEP use ... in people with HIV diagnosed in 2015--2022. We described PrEP use history, AHI, and the prevalence of M184I/V and K65R mutations in a retrospective cohort of people with newly diagnosed HIV in 2015--2022.",The paper repeatedly defines the study timeframe as 2015 through 2022; genotypes included are baseline genotypes obtained within 30 days of diagnoses that occurred during 2015--2022.
37976185,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not reported / No indication that samples were cloned prior to sequencing.,"HIV-related laboratory results (CD4 cell count, HIV viral load [VL], and HIV-1 genotype sequences (Sanger or consensus sequences when next-generation sequencing is conducted)) are reported to the health department and stored in the Registry and laboratory databases. The Methods describe genotypes (Sanger or consensus sequences when next-generation sequencing is conducted) but do not mention cloning of samples prior to sequencing.",The methods specify sequencing approaches (Sanger or consensus from NGS) but do not describe cloning of viral sequences; absence of any statement about cloning suggests that cloning was not part of the described laboratory workflow or was not reported.
37976185,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,Reverse transcriptase (RT) region of pol (inferred from reported mutations M184I/V and K65R).,"We measured the effect of PrEP use (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/tenofivir alafenamide fumarate with emtricitabine) history on the baseline prevalence of M184I/V mutations in people with HIV diagnosed in 2015--2022. Of 10 356 people ... 98 (2%) had the M184I/V mutation, 5 (0.1%) had the K65R mutation, and 2 (<0.1%) had both.","The paper reports detection of M184I/V and K65R, which are well-known resistance-associated substitutions located in the reverse transcriptase (RT) region of the pol gene. While the manuscript does not explicitly state 'RT' or 'pol', the specific mutations reported indicate sequencing of the RT region."
37976185,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Sanger sequencing and consensus sequences derived from next-generation sequencing (NGS).,"HIV-related laboratory results (CD4 cell count, HIV viral load [VL], and HIV-1 genotype sequences (Sanger or consensus sequences when next-generation sequencing is conducted)) are reported to the health department and stored in the Registry and laboratory databases. We included people ... for whom a genotype obtained within 30 days of diagnosis was available in the NYC HIV Surveillance Registry.","The Methods explicitly state that HIV-1 genotype sequences reported were obtained by Sanger sequencing or as consensus sequences when next-generation sequencing was conducted, indicating these were the sequencing approaches used."
37976185,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Not explicitly stated; inferred to be plasma viral RNA (blood plasma) used for genotypic resistance testing.,"HIV-related laboratory results (CD4 cell count, HIV viral load [VL], and HIV-1 genotype sequences (Sanger or consensus sequences when next-generation sequencing is conducted)) are reported to the health department and stored in the Registry and laboratory databases. The Discussion notes that ""plasma VLs may have been below the threshold required to conduct resistance testing, potentially leading to an underestimation of drug resistance in PrEP users.""","The paper does not explicitly state the specimen type, but reference to plasma viral loads and thresholds required to conduct resistance testing implies that plasma (viral RNA from blood) was the specimen source for genotyping. Because this is an inference from discussion of plasma VL and resistance testing, the specimen type is not directly reported."
37976185,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No — sequences were baseline genotypes from newly diagnosed individuals, not from people with virological failure on ART.","We included people with HIV newly diagnosed between 2015 and 2022, assigned for partner services, for whom a genotype obtained within 30 days of diagnosis was available in the NYC HIV Surveillance Registry. We used NYC HIV surveillance and partner services data to establish the relationship between PrEP use history and timing and the development of mutations associated with resistance to TDF/TAF or FTC, the components of PrEP, in people with newly diagnosed HIV in 2015--2022 and with an available baseline genotype within 30 days of diagnosis.","The study population consists of newly diagnosed individuals with baseline genotypes obtained near diagnosis; the paper does not describe sequencing from patients undergoing ART with virological failure. Therefore, sequences are from diagnosis-time genotypes rather than from treatment failure investigations."
37976185,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No.,"We used New York City surveillance and partner services data to measure the effect of PrEP use ... in people with HIV diagnosed in 2015--2022. In contrast to previous findings on PrEP-related drug resistance in the setting of AHI that have been obtained from PrEP trials, case reports, and clinical case series, our study draws its conclusions from HIV surveillance and partner services.","The study is based on surveillance and partner services data (a retrospective cohort of newly diagnosed individuals), and the authors explicitly contrast their approach with PrEP trials, indicating that participants were not enrolled in a clinical trial."
37976185,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes — sequences include individuals with prior PrEP exposure (antiretroviral drugs tenofovir and emtricitabine).,"Any PrEP use was reported by 260 (6%), recent PrEP use by 136 (3%), and past PrEP use by 124 (3%). We assessed for PrEP using TDF/TAF with FTC and did not differentiate between daily or event-driven dosing.","The study specifically documents prior PrEP use (which involves antiretroviral drugs) among participants and examines the association of PrEP history with resistance mutations; therefore, sequences from individuals with prior ARV (PrEP) exposure are included."
37976185,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) — specifically tenofovir (TDF or TAF) and emtricitabine (FTC) as part of PrEP.,We measured the effect of PrEP use (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/tenofivir alafenamide fumarate with emtricitabine) history on the baseline prevalence of M184I/V mutations in people with HIV diagnosed in 2015--2022. We assessed for PrEP using TDF/TAF with FTC and did not differentiate between daily or event-driven dosing.,"The paper defines PrEP exposure as use of tenofovir (either TDF or TAF) with emtricitabine, which are NRTIs; no other ARV drug classes for pre-diagnosis exposure are described in the manuscript."
37976185,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) with emtricitabine (FTC).,We measured the effect of PrEP use (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/tenofivir alafenamide fumarate with emtricitabine) history on the baseline prevalence of M184I/V mutations in people with HIV diagnosed in 2015--2022. We assessed for PrEP using TDF/TAF with FTC and did not differentiate between daily or event-driven dosing.,The Methods clearly define the PrEP regimen of interest as TDF or TAF combined with FTC; these specific drugs are the ARVs reported as prior exposure among study participants.
37976080,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes. The study reports HIV sequences obtained from patient plasma samples and generated sequence data for the PR/RT regions (pol gene).,"Viral RNA was extracted from 200 µL plasma samples using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilton, Germany) according to the operational instructions. The amplified products were sequenced by Sanger sequencing. PDR testing was conducted on 2568 participants in 2022.","The Methods state that viral RNA was extracted from plasma samples and amplified to cover the pol gene (PR and partial RT) and that amplified products were sequenced by Sanger sequencing. The Results report PDR testing on 2568 participants, confirming that patient-derived sequences were produced."
37976080,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No. The study reports genotypic resistance analysis (sequence-based interpretation) rather than in vitro phenotypic drug susceptibility assays.,Realigned sequences were uploaded to the Stanford Drug Resistance Database to identify the degree of resistance of the 12 listed drugs that the WHO recommends for monitoring. The amplified products were sequenced by Sanger sequencing.,"The Methods describe sequence generation and interpretation using the Stanford database to infer resistance levels. There is no mention of phenotypic in vitro susceptibility testing (e.g., phenotypic assays or fold-change measurements), so only genotypic/resistance interpretation data were reported."
37976080,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,"No specific sequence deposit (e.g., GenBank accession numbers) is reported; only web-accessible molecular network results are referenced.","The results and subsequent molecular network diagram are accessible on the web. Sequencher software was used to recombine and edit the original sequence fragments and nucleosides, and realigned sequences were uploaded to the Stanford Drug Resistance Database.","The paper states that results and the molecular network diagram are available online, and that sequences were uploaded to Stanford for resistance interpretation, but it does not state that sequence data were deposited in a public sequence repository (such as GenBank) nor does it list accession numbers. Therefore no explicit public sequence deposit is documented in the text."
37976080,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,No GenBank accession numbers are reported in the paper.,Realigned sequences were uploaded to the Stanford Drug Resistance Database to identify the degree of resistance of the 12 listed drugs. The results and subsequent molecular network diagram are accessible on the web.,"Although the manuscript describes sequence processing, submission to Stanford, and web visualization, it does not provide any GenBank accession numbers or state that sequences were deposited in GenBank. Thus no accession numbers are available from the paper."
37976080,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,2568 participants had valid PDR sequence results; after quality filtering 2555 sequences were used for molecular network analysis.,"PDR testing was conducted on 2568 participants in 2022. Of the 2568 included study participants, PDR was detected in 7.4% (n=190). Of the 2568 sequences in the PR/RT regions, 13 sequences were removed because the sequences in the PR/RT regions were shorter than 1000 bp or the number of mixed bases was >5%. Hence, a total of 2555 sequences in the PR/RT regions were used to construct a molecular transmission network.","The Results report 2568 participants with valid PDR results (i.e., sequencing of PR/RT regions). For the molecular network construction, 13 sequences were excluded for quality reasons, leaving 2555 sequences used in network analyses. Therefore 2568 individuals had sequence data, with 2555 passing the network quality filters."
37976080,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,All sequenced samples were obtained from China (multiple provincial-level administrative divisions).,This cross-sectional study was conducted using 2-stage systematic sampling according to the World Health Organization's surveillance guidelines in 8 provincial-level administrative divisions in 2022. We selected 8 provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs) in China as the study area to conduct a large multicenter observational cross-sectional study.,"The title and Methods explicitly state the study was conducted in China across eight PLADs and list specific Chinese provinces/municipalities, indicating all samples were collected within China."
37976080,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Samples were collected in 2022 (participants started or restarted ART between January and June 2022).,Recruitment and specimen collection of HIV-positive individuals occurred in 2022 as individuals initiated ART. The study eligibility criteria included: started or restarted first-line ART between January and June 2022.,"The Methods specify that recruitment and specimen collection took place in 2022 and that eligible participants started/restarted ART during Jan–Jun 2022, so sequencing reflects samples obtained in 2022."
37976080,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No. The paper describes PCR amplification followed by direct Sanger sequencing and does not report cloning prior to sequencing.,"Extracted RNA was used for first-round polymerase chain reaction, and the products were used for second-round polymerase chain reaction amplification; both rounds were performed in 25 µL volume reactions to amplify the HIV pol gene region (HXB2: 2253-3553 nt). The amplified products were sequenced by Sanger sequencing.","The Methods detail nested PCR amplification and direct Sanger sequencing of PCR products; there is no mention of molecular cloning of PCR products into vectors prior to sequencing, so samples were not cloned before sequencing according to the reported methods."
37976080,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"The pol gene was sequenced, specifically the protease (PR) region and the partial reverse transcriptase (RT) region.",Extracted RNA was used for first-round polymerase chain reaction... to amplify the HIV pol gene region (HXB2: 2253-3553 nt). This covered the PR region (4-99 amino acids) and the partial RT region (1-251 amino acids).,"The Methods explicitly state amplification of the pol gene region covering protease and partial reverse transcriptase, indicating those gene regions were sequenced for resistance analysis."
37976080,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Sanger sequencing of PCR-amplified products.,"The amplified products were sequenced by Sanger sequencing. Extracted RNA was used for first-round polymerase chain reaction, and the products were used for second-round polymerase chain reaction amplification.","The Methods describe nested PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing of the amplified products, identifying Sanger sequencing as the sequencing method used."
37976080,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma samples (viral RNA extracted from 200 µL plasma) were sequenced.,"Viral RNA was extracted from 200 µL plasma samples using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilton, Germany) according to the operational instructions. Recruitment and specimen collection of HIV-positive individuals occurred in 2022 as individuals initiated ART.","The Methods explicitly state RNA extraction from plasma samples, indicating that plasma-derived viral RNA was the source for sequencing."
37976080,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No. The study targeted pretreatment individuals starting or restarting first-line ART; it was not a virological failure cohort, although 3.2% reported prior ARV exposure.","The study eligibility criteria included: (3) started or restarted first-line ART between January and June 2022. The objective was to characterize pretreatment HIV drug resistance (PDR) among HIV-positive individuals. In addition, 3.2% (n=81) of participants had prior ARV drug exposure.","The study design focused on pretreatment surveillance (individuals initiating or reinitiating ART). Although a small proportion had prior ARV exposure, the cohort was not selected for virological failure while on a regimen, and no virological-failure sampling is described."
37976080,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No. This was a multicenter observational cross-sectional surveillance study, not a clinical trial.",This cross-sectional study was conducted using 2-stage systematic sampling according to the World Health Organization's surveillance guidelines in 8 provincial-level administrative divisions in 2022. We selected 8 provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs) in China as the study area to conduct a large multicenter observational cross-sectional study.,The manuscript repeatedly describes the study as an observational cross-sectional survey following WHO PDR surveillance guidelines; there is no indication that participants were enrolled in a clinical trial.
37976080,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"Yes. The study included participants with prior ARV exposure (3.2% of participants), and their sequences were part of the dataset used for PDR analysis.",Of the 2568 study participants with valid PDR results... 3.2% (n=81) of participants had prior ARV drug exposure. Results of the multivariable analysis indicated that individuals who had prior ARV drug exposure had 7.45 times greater odds of PDR compared to those without prior ARV drug exposure.,"Participant characteristics indicate 3.2% had prior ARV exposure, and the analyses examined PDR in relation to prior ARV exposure, implying sequences from these individuals were included in the genotypic resistance dataset."
37976080,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"The paper does not report which specific antiretroviral drug classes were received by the individuals with prior ARV exposure; it only reports that 3.2% had prior ARV exposure and reports class-level resistance results (NNRTI, NRTI, PI) from sequence interpretation.","Of the 2568 study participants with valid PDR results... 3.2% (n=81) of participants had prior ARV drug exposure. The prevalence of PDR to NNRTIs, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs) were 6.3% (n=163), 1.2% (n=32), and 0.2% (n=5), respectively.","While the manuscript presents class-level resistance prevalence derived from sequence interpretation, it does not list which drug classes the previously exposed participants had actually received. The text lacks per-participant prior-regimen class information, so specific classes received before sequencing are not reported."
37976080,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,The paper does not provide details of the specific drugs received by individuals prior to sequencing. It lists the 12 WHO-recommended drugs monitored for resistance in the analysis but does not state which drugs individual participants had received.,"Realigned sequences were uploaded to the Stanford Drug Resistance Database to identify the degree of resistance of the 12 listed drugs that the WHO recommends for monitoring, namely, EFV, NVP, abacavir, zidovudine, lamivudine, tenofovir, emtricitabine, stavudine, didanosine, lopinavir/r, atazanavir/r, and darunavir/r. In addition, 3.2% (n=81) of participants had prior ARV drug exposure.","Although the Methods enumerate the 12 drugs for which resistance was assessed, the manuscript does not report participants' prior medication regimens or list which specific drugs individual participants had taken prior to sampling. Therefore specific drugs received by participants before sequencing are not reported."
38022124,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,No — the paper does not report HIV sequences from patient samples.,This retrospective analysis was performed in HIV-1-positive patients who were initiated BIC/FTC/TAF in the HIV clinic between June 2020 and June 2022. Patient records were analyzed retrospectively.,"I reviewed the manuscript for any mention of sequencing, sequence data, GenBank, viral sequencing methods, or reported sequences and found none. The study is described as a retrospective clinical/observational analysis of treatment outcomes (viral load, CD4 counts, side effects) rather than a molecular sequencing study, so the paper does not report HIV sequences from patient samples."
38022124,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No — the paper does not report in vitro drug susceptibility data.,"We also analyzed the virological suppression (HIV-1 RNA  50 copies/mL) and immunological response (CD4+ T cell count and CD4/CD8 ratio) at one, three, six, nine, and 12 months. Patient records were analyzed retrospectively.","The manuscript reports clinical virological suppression (HIV-1 RNA measurements) and immunological outcomes but contains no descriptions of phenotypic susceptibility assays, IC50/EC50 measurements, phenotyping laboratory methods, or in vitro drug susceptibility testing. A search of the text for terms related to susceptibility or phenotyping found no relevant content."
38022124,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No — there are no sequences reported and therefore none made publicly available.,"This retrospective analysis was performed in HIV-1-positive patients who were initiated BIC/FTC/TAF in the HIV clinic between June 2020 and June 2022. The limitations of our study are that the analysis was retrospective, confounding factors could not be controlled, and data were obtained from a single center in Turkey, which limits generalizability to other populations.","The paper contains no mention of sequencing, sequence deposits, GenBank accession numbers, data repositories, or shared sequence data. Because no sequences are reported in the manuscript, none were made publicly available from this work."
38022124,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported (no sequencing was performed or accession numbers given).,This retrospective analysis was performed in HIV-1-positive patients who were initiated BIC/FTC/TAF in the HIV clinic between June 2020 and June 2022. Patient records were analyzed retrospectively.,"The manuscript does not include any GenBank accession numbers or any statements about sequence deposition. Because no sequencing data are presented, there are no accession numbers to report."
38022124,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Zero — the study did not obtain samples for HIV sequencing.,"A total of 116 patients were included in the study; 50 patients were naive, and 66 patients had previous treatment experience. Patient records were analyzed retrospectively.","Although the study included 116 clinical patients for analysis of treatment outcomes (viral load, CD4 counts, etc.), there is no description of obtaining samples for sequencing or performing sequencing. Therefore no individuals had samples obtained specifically for HIV sequencing in this study (0)."
38022124,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable — no sequenced samples; study was conducted in Turkey (Antalya).,"This retrospective analysis was performed in HIV-1-positive patients who were initiated BIC/FTC/TAF ... at the HIV clinic in Antalya, Turkey, between June 2020 and June 2022. The limitations of our study are that the analysis was retrospective, confounding factors could not be controlled, and data were obtained from a single center in Turkey, which limits generalizability to other populations.","No sequencing was performed, so there are no sequenced samples to attribute to any country. The clinical cohort was recruited from a single center in Antalya, Turkey, so all clinical data originate from Turkey."
38022124,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable — no sequencing performed; clinical data were collected between June 2020 and June 2022.,This retrospective analysis was performed in HIV-1-positive patients who were initiated BIC/FTC/TAF in the HIV clinic between June 2020 and June 2022. Patients who received BIC/FTC/TAF for at least 12 months were included in this study.,"There is no mention of sequencing or sequence collection. The study period for patient enrollment and sample collection for clinical assays (viral load, labs) is given as June 2020 to June 2022; however, no sequencing samples were reported."
38022124,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No — samples were not cloned prior to sequencing (no sequencing was performed).,"Patient records were analyzed retrospectively. We also analyzed the virological suppression (HIV-1 RNA  50 copies/mL) and immunological response (CD4+ T cell count and CD4/CD8 ratio) at one, three, six, nine, and 12 months.","The manuscript contains no methodology or mention of molecular cloning, cloning prior to sequencing, or sequencing workflows. Because no sequencing was performed, no cloning step occurred."
38022124,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,None — the paper does not report sequencing of any HIV genes.,"We also analyzed the virological suppression (HIV-1 RNA  50 copies/mL) and immunological response (CD4+ T cell count and CD4/CD8 ratio) at one, three, six, nine, and 12 months. Patient records were analyzed retrospectively.","The report focuses on clinical outcomes (viral load and immunological markers) and does not describe sequencing of pol, env, gag, or other HIV genes. Therefore no HIV genes were sequenced or reported."
38022124,10,What method was used for sequencing?,"Not applicable — no sequencing was performed, so no sequencing method was used or reported.","Patient records were analyzed retrospectively. We also analyzed the virological suppression (HIV-1 RNA  50 copies/mL) and immunological response (CD4+ T cell count and CD4/CD8 ratio) at one, three, six, nine, and 12 months.","There is no methods section describing sequencing techniques (Sanger, next-generation sequencing, PCR amplification, etc.). The laboratory methods described relate to routine clinical laboratory parameters rather than sequencing."
38022124,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Not applicable — no sequencing was performed; clinical measurements (HIV-1 RNA) imply plasma/blood samples were used for viral load testing.,"We also analyzed the virological suppression (HIV-1 RNA  50 copies/mL) and immunological response (CD4+ T cell count and CD4/CD8 ratio) at one, three, six, nine, and 12 months. A total of 116 patients were included in the study; 50 patients were naive, and 66 patients had previous treatment experience.","Although the paper does not describe sequencing, it reports HIV-1 RNA viral load and CD4/CD8 counts, which are routinely measured from plasma and whole blood, respectively. The manuscript does not state that any samples were sequenced."
38022124,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,No — no sequences were obtained; the study reports virological outcomes but does not report sequencing of samples from individuals with virological failure.,"In our real-life observational study, BIC/FTC/TAF treatment achieved rapid viral suppression, maintained viral suppression in virally suppressed patients, and was effective for immunological recovery in both treatment-experienced and naive HIV patients. Patient records were analyzed retrospectively.","The manuscript describes clinical virological suppression and switching regimens but contains no sequencing data from any participants, including those with virological failure. Therefore no sequences from such individuals were obtained or reported."
38022124,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — this was a retrospective observational (real-life) study, not a clinical trial.","This retrospective analysis was performed in HIV-1-positive patients who were initiated BIC/FTC/TAF ... between June 2020 and June 2022. In our real-life observational study, BIC/FTC/TAF treatment achieved rapid viral suppression...","The authors explicitly describe the work as a retrospective, real-life observational study and compare their findings to randomized clinical trials in the discussion. There is no indication that participants were enrolled in a clinical trial."
38022124,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No — the paper does not report HIV sequences; it does report that many participants were treatment-experienced prior to switching to BIC/FTC/TAF.,"A total of 116 patients, 66 (56.9%) treatment-experienced and 50 (43.1%) naive, were evaluated within the scope of the study. It was found that 93.9% of experienced patients used EVG/c/FTC/TAF and 4.5% used DTG+TDF/FTC before BIC/FTC/TAF.","While the cohort includes treatment-experienced individuals and details prior ART regimens are provided, the manuscript contains no sequencing data from those individuals. Therefore it does not report HIV sequences from previously treated participants."
38022124,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not applicable for sequencing (no sequencing), but prior ART regimens reported include INSTIs (integrase strand transfer inhibitors) and NRTIs (nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors); cobicistat (a pharmacokinetic booster) was also used as part of a combination.","It was found that 93.9% of experienced patients used EVG/c/FTC/TAF and 4.5% used DTG+TDF/FTC before BIC/FTC/TAF. This retrospective analysis was performed in HIV-1-positive patients who were initiated BIC/FTC/TAF (either as first-line therapy or as a switch from a previous regimen (TAF/FTC/EVG/c or TDF+FTC+DTG) at the HIV clinic in Antalya, Turkey, between June 2020 and June 2022.","The named prior regimens include EVG (elvitegravir) and DTG (dolutegravir), which are INSTIs, and TAF/TDF and FTC, which are NRTIs. Cobicistat (c) is a booster, not an antiretroviral class per se. The paper lists these prior regimens, so the relevant drug classes are INSTIs and NRTIs."
38022124,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,No sequencing was done; prior drugs reported in the cohort include EVG/c/FTC/TAF (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide) and DTG+TDF/FTC (dolutegravir + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + emtricitabine).,"It was found that 93.9% of experienced patients used EVG/c/FTC/TAF and 4.5% used DTG+TDF/FTC before BIC/FTC/TAF. Patients older than 18 years of age, diagnosed with HIV, and receiving BIC/FTC/TAF for at least 12 months were included in this study.","The manuscript specifies the prior regimens used by treatment-experienced patients: mostly EVG/c/FTC/TAF (a fixed-dose combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide) and a smaller fraction who used DTG+TDF/FTC (dolutegravir plus tenofovir DF and emtricitabine). Because no sequencing was performed, these drugs are reported only as prior treatments in the clinical cohort."
37993493,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,"For 23 samples, protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) genotyping were successful, with 13 sequences containing RT inhibitor surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs) (56.5%). Thirty samples were successfully genotyped for integrase with 3 sequences (10.08%) containing integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) SDRMs.","The paper explicitly states that genotyping was performed and gives counts of successful genotyping in protease/RT and integrase regions, which indicates HIV sequences were generated from patient plasma samples for those genomic regions."
37993493,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,"No — the paper reports genotypic-inferred drug susceptibility, not direct in vitro phenotypic susceptibility assays.","We used Management and Development for Health (MDH) WHO adapted protocol (Unpublished) to perform HIVDR testing using the 3500xL genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems), a capillary sequencer using Sanger-style sequencing. The drug susceptibility assessment based on the patterns of mutations per patient is illustrated in Fig. 3.","The methods describe sequencing and interpretation of mutations (genotypic analysis) and the results present drug susceptibility assessments inferred from mutation patterns (e.g., Stanford HIVDB inference). There is no description of phenotypic in vitro assays (e.g., culture-based phenotypic susceptibility testing) or laboratory phenotypic EC50/IC50 measurements, so only genotypic-inferred susceptibility is reported."

(No GenBank accession numbers are listed anywhere in the manuscript.),"The manuscript's data availability statement directs requests to the authors and does not include GenBank accession numbers; throughout the text no accession numbers are provided, so no public GenBank accessions were reported in the paper."
37993493,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,"33 individuals had samples eligible for genotyping (VL ≥1000 copies/mL); 31 were successfully genotyped in at least one region — 23 had successful protease/RT genotypes, 30 had successful integrase genotypes, and 22 were genotyped in all three regions.","Only 33 had VL ≥1000 copies/mL, resulting in a viral suppression level of 94.48% (565/598, 95% CI 92.34--96.17%). Genetic sequencing was successful in the protease and reverse transcriptase regions for 23 patients' samples (69.70%) and in the integrase region for 30 patients' samples (90.90%).","The study only subjected samples with VL ≥1000 to genotyping (33 samples). The results section reports the numbers of successful genotypes by region (23 PRRT, 30 integrase) and that 31/33 samples were successfully genotyped in at least one region with 22 genotyped in all regions; therefore 33 samples were obtained for sequencing and varying numbers yielded successful sequence data."
37993493,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Tanzania (Dar es Salaam).,High viral suppression and detection of dolutegravir-resistance associated mutations in treatment-experienced Tanzanian adults living with HIV-1 in Dar es Salaam. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between February and May 2023 in the Dar es Salaam Urban Cohort Study (DUCS) platform of the Ilala district in Dar es Salaam.,"The title and methods clearly indicate the study population and sampling location: treatment-experienced adults in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. No other countries are mentioned as sources of sequenced samples."
37993493,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Samples were obtained in 2023 (between February and May 2023).,"Between February and May 2023 a cross-sectional survey with random sampling was conducted in the six clinics in an urban cohort in Dar es Salaam. Between February and May 2023, 7083 treated patients were screened from the HIV care and treatment clinics in the DUCS platform for eligibility criteria and 1651 patients were found eligible for inclusion (Fig. 1).","The study period for recruitment and sample collection is explicitly stated as February–May 2023, so the sequenced samples were collected during that 2023 time window."
37993493,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No — samples were not cloned; direct plasma-derived PCR products were Sanger-sequenced.,"We used Management and Development for Health (MDH) WHO adapted protocol (Unpublished) to perform HIVDR testing using the 3500xL genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems), a capillary sequencer using Sanger-style sequencing. Before importing the generated sequences (fasta format) to Stanford University HIVDR database, the raw sequence (abi format) was assembled, aligned and edited using a RECall (v2.32)- web based sequence analysis then saved as fasta file.","The methods describe direct Sanger sequencing of PCR products (plasma samples) and subsequent ABI/RECall assembly/edition; there is no mention of molecular cloning of PCR products into plasmids prior to sequencing, so cloning was not performed."
37993493,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Protease, reverse transcriptase (RT), and integrase.","The sequenced codons were 6--99, 1--251, and 1--288, for protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase proteins, respectively. For 23 samples, protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) genotyping were successful, with 13 sequences containing RT inhibitor surveillance drug resistance mutations (SDRMs).","The methods explicitly list the codon ranges for protease, RT and integrase and the results report genotyping success and mutation detection in these three genomic regions, confirming these genes were sequenced."
37993493,10,What method was used for sequencing?,"Sanger-style (capillary) sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 3500xL genetic analyser, with sequence assembly/editing via RECall and interpretation via Stanford HIVDR database.","We used Management and Development for Health (MDH) WHO adapted protocol (Unpublished) to perform HIVDR testing using the 3500xL genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems), a capillary sequencer using Sanger-style sequencing. Before importing the generated sequences (fasta format) to Stanford University HIVDR database, the raw sequence (abi format) was assembled, aligned and edited using a RECall (v2.32)- web based sequence analysis then saved as fasta file.","The methods explicitly describe the instrument (3500xL), the sequencing platform (capillary Sanger), and the downstream processing tools (RECall for assembly and Stanford HIVDB for mutation analysis), indicating the sequencing method and workflow."
37993493,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma derived from venous blood (EDTA tubes).,"Eight ml of venous blood was drawn using two EDTA tubes each with 4 ml. Whole blood was separated into plasma within 6 h of collection... Given that we followed the current Tanzania national HIV treatment guidelines, only samples with viral load count ≥ 1000 copies/mL were subjected to analysis of HIVDR mutations. We used Management and Development for Health (MDH) WHO adapted protocol (Unpublished) to perform HIVDR testing ... for plasma samples.","The methods describe drawing venous blood into EDTA tubes, separating plasma, and specifically state the WHO-adapted protocol for plasma samples was used for HIVDR testing, so plasma was the sequenced sample type."
37993493,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Yes — sequences were obtained from individuals with virological failure (defined as VL ≥1000 copies/mL) who were on ART.,"Only 33 had VL ≥1000 copies/mL, resulting in a viral suppression level of 94.48% (565/598, 95% CI 92.34--96.17%). Genetic sequencing was successful in the protease and reverse transcriptase regions for 23 patients' samples (69.70%) and in the integrase region for 30 patients' samples (90.90%).","The study targeted samples with VL ≥1000 (virological failure by local criteria) for genotyping and reports successful sequencing of many of those samples; the results also describe treatment histories for those patients, confirming they were on ART when sampled."
37993493,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — this was a cross-sectional survey of routine care patients, not a clinical trial.",A cross-sectional survey was conducted between February and May 2023 in the Dar es Salaam Urban Cohort Study (DUCS) platform of the Ilala district in Dar es Salaam. All adults (18 years and above) living with HIV and resident in the DUCS platform area and receiving antiretroviral therapy in CTCs found in the DUCS area were eligible to participate in the study.,"The design is described as a cross-sectional survey of patients receiving routine ART at clinics; there is no indication of randomization, intervention arms, trial registration, or clinical trial procedures, so patients were not participants in a clinical trial."
37993493,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"Yes — the study reports sequences from treatment-experienced individuals who had been on ART (at least one year), mostly on DTG-based regimens and some with prior ART exposures.","The objective... in treatment-experienced Tanzanian adults living with HIV-1 in Dar es Salaam. Patients who had received ART for less than one year were excluded from the study. Approximately, 99% of survey patients were taking TLD regimen.","Inclusion criteria required patients to be on ART at least one year, and the manuscript repeatedly notes that nearly all patients were on tenofovir+lamivudine+dolutegravir (TLD) or had prior regimen changes; therefore sequences come from individuals with prior ARV exposure."
37993493,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs).","The high virological suppression rate in the studied area is probably linked to the policy change of replacing non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI)-based regimen by DTG-based regimen (tenofovir + lamivudine + DTG or TLD) in first line. Of 33 patients with high viral load (≥ 1000 copies/mL) despite taking ART, 30 (90.91%) were using a DTG-based regimen, mostly TDF + 3TC + DTG, two patients were using ABC + 3TC + LPV/r, and one was taking ABC + 3TC + ATV/r.","Treatment histories and regimen descriptions include NRTIs (TDF, 3TC, ABC), NNRTIs (previous use such as EFV is discussed), INSTI (DTG), and PIs (LPV/r, ATV/r), indicating exposure to these major ARV drug classes prior to sequencing."
37993493,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Specifically reported drugs include tenofovir (TDF), lamivudine (3TC), dolutegravir (DTG) as the predominant TLD regimen; abacavir (ABC); lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r); atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r); efavirenz (EFV) is mentioned as part of prior first-line regimens that may have failed.","Approximately 99% were receiving tenofovir + lamivudine + dolutegravir as a fixed dose combination. Of 33 patients with high viral load (≥ 1000 copies/mL) despite taking ART, 30 (90.91%) were using a DTG-based regimen, mostly TDF + 3TC + DTG, two patients were using ABC + 3TC + LPV/r, and one was taking ABC + 3TC + ATV/r. Patient MC-243 was already receiving a second line PI-containing regimen, when switching to DTG, suggesting this patient had failed TDF + 3TC + EFV.","The manuscript explicitly lists the common regimens and drugs used by patients (TDF, 3TC, DTG as TLD; ABC with LPV/r or ATV/r for some patients), and mentions prior EFV-containing regimens, so these specific drugs were received by study participants prior to sequencing."

The HIV RNA was extracted using the TGuide S32 Magnetic Viral DNA/RNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China) and the HIV viral load was determined by HIV-RNA Quantification Kit (Sansure Biotech Inc., Hunan, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.","Although no sequencing was done, the sampled material was plasma derived from EDTA blood and RNA was extracted from plasma for viral load assays; therefore there were no sequenced sample types to report."
38031075,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,No — no sequencing was performed. The study did report individuals with detectable or low-level viremia while on ART.,Low-level viremia (viral load between 50 and 999 copies/mL) was reported in 228 (11.7%) patients. HIV drug resistance and baseline CD4 count may be important predictors of viral suppression but were not assessed due to insufficient resources.,"The paper documents patients with low-level viremia (which can indicate virological failure) but explicitly states drug resistance/sequencing was not assessed, so no sequences were obtained from such individuals."
38031075,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — this was a cross-sectional observational survey, not a clinical trial.","We used a cross-sectional study design to collect primary data from adult patients aged 18 years or older between August 2022 and January 2023. After providing written informed consent, we recruited participants non-randomly as they presented to the different health facilities between August 2022 and January 2023.","The methods explicitly describe a cross-sectional design with non-random recruitment of routine clinic patients, which indicates this was not a clinical trial."
38031075,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No — no sequences were reported; however the study population predominantly consisted of individuals receiving ART.,"Most were women (1,720, 76.3%), had been on ART for more than 24 months (1,434, 63.6%) and were receiving a fixed dose combination of tenofovir, lamivudine and dolutegravir (1,705, 75.7%). HIV drug resistance and baseline CD4 count may be important predictors of viral suppression but were not assessed due to insufficient resources.","Although most participants were on ART (so if sequencing had been done they would have been previously exposed to ARVs), the manuscript states that drug resistance/sequencing was not assessed; thus there are no sequences from treated individuals to report."
38031075,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Not applicable for sequencing; participants received NRTIs and either an INSTI (dolutegravir) or an NNRTI (efavirenz).,"Most ... were receiving a fixed dose combination of tenofovir, lamivudine and dolutegravir (1,705, 75.7%). The rate of viral suppression was higher in dolutegravir-based therapy than in efavirenz-based therapy (p = 0.002).","The regimens listed (tenofovir and lamivudine are NRTIs; dolutegravir is an INSTI; efavirenz is an NNRTI) indicate the drug classes participants received. The study did not perform sequencing, but these are the ART classes used in the cohort."
38031075,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Tenofovir, lamivudine, dolutegravir, and efavirenz were specifically mentioned.","Most ... were receiving a fixed dose combination of tenofovir, lamivudine and dolutegravir (1,705, 75.7%). The rate of viral suppression was higher in dolutegravir-based therapy (1,277, 89.5%) than in efavirenz-based therapy (418, 86.2%) (p = 0.002).",The manuscript lists the common regimens in the cohort—TDF (tenofovir) + 3TC (lamivudine) + DTG (dolutegravir) and efavirenz-based therapy—so these are the drugs reported as received by participants. No sequencing was performed after drug exposure.
38033131,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,No — the paper does not report HIV sequences from patient samples.,"Data were collected by trained nurses who have experience working in ART clinics. As this study used secondary data, we do not have verbal or written consent.","The paper describes a retrospective, chart-based study in which data were extracted from patient records and viral load measurements were used to define virological failure; there is no mention of any sequencing, sequence generation, or sequence analysis in the Methods, Results, or Discussion sections. The use of secondary chart data and absence of any description of laboratory sequencing methods indicate that no HIV sequences from patient samples were reported."
38033131,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No — the paper does not report any in vitro drug susceptibility data.,"The dependent variable was the incidence of virological failure, whereas the independent variables were socio-demographic characteristics of children and adolescents and caregivers. Viral failure is defined as a viral load above 1000 copies/ml based on two consecutive viral loads (VL) measurements, after 6 months of ART initiation and with 3 months of enhanced adherence support following the first viral load test.","The study focuses on clinical/epidemiologic outcomes (incidence and predictors of virological failure) using viral load data from charts and does not describe any phenotypic assays, drug susceptibility testing, or laboratory methods that would generate in vitro susceptibility results. Therefore no in vitro susceptibility data are reported."
38033131,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No — there are no sequences reported and thus none made publicly available.,"All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files. The Methods and Results sections describe chart review and viral load measurements but contain no mention of sequence data, sequence repositories, or accession numbers.","The Data Availability statement indicates data are within the paper and supporting files; however, nowhere in the manuscript are sequence data, sequence deposition statements, or accession numbers described. Because no sequencing was performed or reported, no sequences were deposited or made publicly available."
38033131,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported (no sequencing performed).,All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files. There is no mention anywhere in the paper of GenBank accession numbers or sequence deposition.,"GenBank accession numbers would be explicitly listed if sequences had been generated and submitted; the manuscript contains no such identifiers or statements, consistent with the fact that no sequencing work was performed as part of this chart-based retrospective study."
38033131,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Zero — no samples were obtained for HIV sequencing.,"Finally, 492 patient charts that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in the analysis. Data were extracted by using an appropriate data extraction tool which was adapted in the English language from national HIV intake and follow-up care after checking the availability of variables in the HIV patient registration book.","Although 492 patient charts were reviewed and viral load measurements were used to define virological failure, the study does not describe obtaining biological samples for sequencing. The extraction of clinical data from charts indicates chart-based data collection rather than collection of specimens for sequencing; thus no individuals had samples obtained specifically for HIV sequencing."
38033131,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable — no sequencing was performed; the study population was from Ethiopia.,"An institutionally based retrospective follow-up study was carried out. Data were collected from April 1--30, 2021 among HIV infected children and adolescents on ART between January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019, in East Shewa, Oromia region, Ethiopia.","The study was conducted in East Shewa, Oromia region, Ethiopia, so if any biological samples had been sequenced they would have been from Ethiopia; however, because no sequencing was performed, there are no sequenced samples from any country to report."
38033131,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Not applicable — no sequencing was performed; clinical data cover January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2019.","Data were collected from April 1--30, 2021 among HIV infected children and adolescents on ART between January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019, in East Shewa, Oromia region, Ethiopia. The sample size was determined ... and the final sample size was 511. Finally, 492 patient charts that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in the analysis.","While the clinical records and viral load measurements reviewed in the study pertain to the period January 2015 to December 2019, the manuscript does not report any sequencing of samples from those years. Therefore there are no sequenced samples or sequencing years to report; the only relevant years are those of the charted ART follow-up."
38033131,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not applicable — no sequencing or cloning was reported.,Data were extracted by using an appropriate data extraction tool which was adapted in the English language from national HIV intake and follow-up care after checking the availability of variables in the HIV patient registration book. The Methods and Results sections describe chart review and statistical analyses with no laboratory sequencing or cloning procedures mentioned.,"Cloning prior to sequencing would be described in laboratory methods if performed; the paper contains no such laboratory methods, protocols, or references to cloning, so no cloning was done."
38033131,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,None — the paper does not report sequencing of any HIV genes.,"The dependent variable was the incidence of virological failure, whereas the independent variables were socio-demographic characteristics of children and adolescents and caregivers. There is no description of sequencing targets, genes (e.g., pol, env, gag), or sequence analysis anywhere in the manuscript.",If genes had been sequenced the manuscript would specify which genomic regions were targeted; the absence of any mention of sequencing or gene targets indicates that no HIV genes were sequenced or reported.
38033131,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not applicable — no sequencing methods were reported.,"Data collection and analysis are described as chart review and statistical modeling (Weibull regression, Kaplan Meier), and ethical considerations note use of secondary data. The Methods section contains no description of laboratory assays, sequencing platforms, primers, or protocols.","Sequencing methods (e.g., Sanger, next-generation sequencing) would be explicitly described in Methods if used; their complete absence in this paper shows no sequencing was performed and thus no sequencing method applies."
38033131,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Not applicable — no samples were sequenced. The study used patient charts and viral load measurements from clinical records.,Data were extracted by using an appropriate data extraction tool which was adapted in the English language from national HIV intake and follow-up care after checking the availability of variables in the HIV patient registration book. Viral failure is defined as a viral load above 1000 copies/ml based on two consecutive viral loads (VL) measurements.,"The study relied on chart data and recorded viral load results rather than reporting sequencing of plasma, PBMCs, or other specimen types. Because no sequencing was performed, there are no sequenced sample types to report."
38033131,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"No — no sequences were obtained from any individuals, including those with virological failure.","The incidence rate of first-line ART virological failure was 4.2 per1000 follow-up months (95% CI: 3.41, 5.22). Reasons for ART regimen changes included virological failure, but the paper does not describe sequencing or sequence analyses for those with virological failure.","Although the study identifies individuals who experienced virological failure and discusses regimen changes, it does not report generating sequences from those individuals or performing resistance testing; therefore no sequences were obtained from people with virological failure."
38033131,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — the patients were part of routine care and the study was a retrospective follow-up of clinical records, not a clinical trial.","An institutionally based retrospective follow-up study was carried out. Ethical clearance was obtained ... As this study used secondary data, we do not have verbal or written consent.",The study design is explicitly described as a retrospective follow-up (chart review) of patients in routine ART clinics across hospitals; there is no indication that participants were enrolled in a clinical trial.
38033131,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"No — the paper does not report any HIV sequences; however, the participants were children and adolescents who had received ARV therapy (first-line ART).","Data were collected ... among HIV infected children and adolescents on ART between January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019. More than half of study participants 272 (55.28%) have initiated NVP-based NNRTI regimen.","While the cohort consisted of individuals who had received antiretroviral drugs (first-line ART, many on nevirapine-based regimens), there is no sequencing reported from these individuals. Thus there are no HIV sequences from previously treated individuals in this paper."
38033131,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not applicable for sequencing; among the study participants, NNRTI-based regimens (specifically NVP-based) were explicitly reported.","More than half of study participants 272 (55.28%) have initiated NVP-based NNRTI regimen. Of the total 492 patients, 443 (90.04%) and 425 (86.38%) had been placed on cotrimoxazole and isoniazid prophylaxis respectively.","Although no sequencing was done, the manuscript documents that many participants received antiretroviral therapy, with a majority starting nevirapine (NVP)-based non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) regimens. Other ARV drug classes are not explicitly enumerated in the text."
38033131,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Not applicable for sequencing; the paper explicitly mentions nevirapine (NVP)-based regimens and reports PMTCT history and prophylactic drugs (cotrimoxazole, isoniazid).",More than half of study participants 272 (55.28%) have initiated NVP-based NNRTI regimen. About 24 (4.88%) of the study participants had a history of use of PMTCT (Prevention of Maternal to Child Transmission) service.,"The only specific antiretroviral drug named in the manuscript is nevirapine (NVP) as part of NVP-based NNRTI first-line regimens; the paper also notes PMTCT history and prophylactic medications (cotrimoxazole, isoniazid). No other individual ARV drugs or regimen components are listed, and no sequencing was performed."
38058846,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Not explicitly — the paper reports HIV drug resistance testing results for three patients but does not explicitly state that HIV sequences from patient samples are reported.,"At 22 weeks' gestation, after 17 months on a DTG-based regimen, HIV drug resistance testing confirmed high-level DTG resistance (Table 1). Resistance testing was ordered at 27 weeks' gestation and DTG resistance was confirmed at 29 weeks (Table 1).","The manuscript repeatedly states that HIV drug resistance testing was performed and confirmed high-level DTG resistance for the cases, but nowhere in the provided text does it state that nucleotide sequences or sequence data are reported or shown. The references are to resistance testing results (Table 1) rather than to sequences or sequence files."
38058846,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No — the paper does not report in vitro drug susceptibility (phenotypic) data.,HIV drug resistance testing confirmed high-level DTG resistance (Table 1). We have described the first reported cases of DTG resistance in PBFW in the South African ART programme.,"The text describes clinical resistance testing (genotypic inference of resistance) and clinical outcomes but contains no mention of in vitro phenotypic susceptibility assays, cell-based phenotypic testing, fold-change values, or laboratory susceptibility data. Thus there is no evidence of in vitro drug susceptibility data in the provided content."
38058846,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No — there is no indication that HIV sequences were deposited in public repositories.,The authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article. HIV drug resistance testing confirmed high-level DTG resistance (Table 1).,"The data availability statement says data are available within the article, but there is no statement about depositing sequences in public databases (e.g., GenBank) or providing accession numbers. The manuscript does not mention submission of sequence files to public repositories."
38058846,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,The authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article. HIV drug resistance testing confirmed high-level DTG resistance (Table 1).,"No GenBank accession numbers or other sequence accession identifiers are provided in the text. The data availability statement does not list accession numbers, and Table 1 is referenced for resistance results but accession numbers are not mentioned in the supplied content."
38058846,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Three individuals.,"We have described the first reported cases of DTG resistance in PBFW in the South African ART programme. In all cases, there were intensified clinical support during antenatal and postnatal care, and vertical transmission of HIV was prevented.","The article is a case series describing three cases (Case 1, Case 2, Case 3) for whom HIV drug resistance testing was performed. Therefore samples for resistance testing (i.e., sequencing/genotyping) were obtained from these three individuals."
38058846,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,South Africa.,We have described the first reported cases of DTG resistance in PBFW in the South African ART programme. This emphasises the importance of integrating psychosocial and mental health support into HIV services.,"The manuscript explicitly situates the cases within the South African ART programme and describes the clinical care and databases (National Health Laboratory Services) used in South Africa, indicating that the samples and testing were from South Africa."
38058846,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,The resistance testing for the cases occurred in 2022–2023 (testing confirmed in late 2022 and in 2023).,"In November 2022, at nine weeks' gestation, she attended her first antenatal care (ANC) visit... At 22 weeks' gestation, after 17 months on a DTG-based regimen, HIV drug resistance testing confirmed high-level DTG resistance (Table 1). In May 2023, she attended ANC with an unplanned pregnancy at 26 weeks' gestation. Resistance testing was ordered at 27 weeks' gestation and DTG resistance was confirmed at 29 weeks (Table 1).","The case narratives provide dates: Case 1 has antenatal visits noted in November 2022 with subsequent resistance testing at 22 weeks' gestation, and Case 3 explicitly attended ANC in May 2023 with resistance confirmed thereafter. These statements indicate resistance testing (and thus sequence/genotype generation) occurred in late 2022 and 2023."
38058846,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not stated / no indication that samples were cloned prior to sequencing.,HIV drug resistance testing confirmed high-level DTG resistance (Table 1). The authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article.,"The provided text describes resistance testing results but contains no methods details such as cloning of viral sequences, cloning prior to sequencing, or single-genome amplification. Since this is not mentioned, there is no evidence cloning was performed."
38058846,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,Not specified in the provided text.,HIV drug resistance testing confirmed high-level DTG resistance (Table 1). Resistance testing was ordered at 27 weeks' gestation and DTG resistance was confirmed at 29 weeks (Table 1).,"While dolutegravir resistance is associated with mutations in the HIV integrase gene, the manuscript does not explicitly state which gene regions were sequenced (e.g., integrase, reverse transcriptase, protease). The text only refers to resistance testing results without specifying target genes."
38058846,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not specified in the provided text.,HIV drug resistance testing confirmed high-level DTG resistance (Table 1). The authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article.,"The article reports resistance testing outcomes but does not include methodological details about sequencing techniques (e.g., Sanger sequencing, next-generation sequencing) in the supplied content, so the sequencing method cannot be determined from the provided text."
38058846,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Not specified explicitly; implied plasma viral samples for resistance testing but sample type is not stated in the text.,"At 22 weeks' gestation... HIV drug resistance testing confirmed high-level DTG resistance (Table 1). At 12 weeks post-partum, with a VL of 120 000 copies/mm3... resistance testing confirmed high-level DTG resistance (Table 1).","The text references viral loads and clinical resistance testing, which in practice are typically performed on plasma specimens, but the manuscript does not explicitly state the specimen type (plasma, whole blood, dried blood spot). Therefore the exact sample type is not specified in the provided content."
38058846,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Yes — all three cases had virological failure while on DTG-containing regimens when resistance testing was performed.,"After re-engaging in August 2020, she did not achieve viral suppression... At 22 weeks' gestation, after 17 months on a DTG-based regimen, HIV drug resistance testing confirmed high-level DTG resistance (Table 1). Throughout this pregnancy, and beyond delivery, despite improved adherence of > 80%... VLs remained unsuppressed... resistance testing confirmed high-level DTG resistance (Table 1).",Each case description documents prolonged unsuppressed viral loads or virological failure while on DTG-based therapy and then states that resistance testing confirmed DTG resistance. Thus resistance/genotype data were derived from individuals experiencing virological failure on treatment.
38058846,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — they were patients managed in clinical care and included as a case series, not participants in a clinical trial.","Each patient included in this case series was managed directly by two of the authors, Fourie and Davies, within advanced clinical care or higher risk pregnancy clinics. The patients provided written consent to be included in the case series.","The manuscript describes a case series of routine clinical patients managed in care settings; there is no mention that these patients were enrolled in a clinical trial. The RADIANT-TB trial is referenced in discussion, but the cases themselves were not trial participants."
38058846,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes — at least two of the three cases had prior antiretroviral therapy exposure before the resistance testing.,"In 2018, with a CD4 count of 6 cells/mm3, she developed first-line virological failure and was switched to lamivudine/abacavir/lopinavir/ritonavir. Only after receiving resistance results did Case 2 disclose additional ART experience prior to 2020, with low adherence and multiple treatment interruptions.","Case 1 had prior ART and treatment interruptions noted since 2018, and Case 2 disclosed ART experience prior to 2020 (likely TEE) with interruptions. Case 3 was described as ART naïve at initiation of TLD. Therefore the study includes resistance results from individuals with prior ARV exposure."
38058846,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs).",She was switched to lamivudine/abacavir/lopinavir/ritonavir. Case 2 reported being initiated on a single daily pill which... would have most likely been tenofovir/emtricitabine/efavirenz (TEE). She was switched to tenofovir/emtricitabine/darunavir/ritonavir in June 2023. TLD was initiated two weeks after TB treatment.,"The regimens listed include NRTIs (lamivudine, abacavir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, zidovudine), an NNRTI (efavirenz; nevirapine used for prophylaxis is also an NNRTI), protease inhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir), and INSTI (dolutegravir in TLD/TLD-like regimens). These map to the standard drug classes NRTI, NNRTI, PI, and INSTI."
38058846,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Drugs mentioned include lamivudine, abacavir, zidovudine, tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz (likely in earlier regimen), nevirapine (infant prophylaxis and mentioned), lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, and dolutegravir (DTG) as part of TLD/TLD-like regimens.",She was switched to lamivudine/abacavir/lopinavir/ritonavir. She was switched to lamivudine/zidovudine/DTG. Case 2 reported being initiated on a single daily pill which... would have most likely been tenofovir/emtricitabine/efavirenz (TEE). She was switched to tenofovir/emtricitabine/darunavir/ritonavir in June 2023.,"The case descriptions list specific regimens and drugs taken by the patients prior to and around the time of resistance testing: lamivudine, abacavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, zidovudine, dolutegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz (inferred as probable prior regimen), and darunavir/ritonavir. Nevirapine is cited for infant prophylaxis and in maternal regimens in some switches. These named drugs are taken directly from the case narratives."
38072961,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes — genotypic (Sanger) sequencing of HIV from patient CSF and plasma was performed.,"further HIV drug resistance tests of CSF and plasma (Sanger sequencing in Dongguan Medical Laboratory of Micro-scale and Presicion) presented identical results of major protease inhibitor (PI)-related mutations, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-related mutations, and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-related mutations. The encephalitis owning to CSF drug-resistant HIV escape was considered.","The paper explicitly states that HIV drug resistance testing was performed by Sanger sequencing on CSF and plasma, which indicates that viral sequences were generated from patient samples and used to identify resistance mutations."
38072961,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,"No — the paper reports genotypic (Sanger) resistance testing, not in vitro phenotypic susceptibility assays.","further HIV drug resistance tests of CSF and plasma (Sanger sequencing in Dongguan Medical Laboratory of Micro-scale and Presicion) presented identical results of major protease inhibitor (PI)-related mutations, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-related mutations, and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-related mutations. ART regimen was switched to zidovudine, lamivudine, and dolutegravir according to drug resistance tests.","The methods reported are genotypic (Sanger) sequencing to identify resistance mutations; no mention is made of phenotypic or in vitro susceptibility testing (e.g., culture-based phenotypic assays), so only genotypic data were reported."

All data from this study are included in this article.","While sequencing was performed, the manuscript provides no GenBank or other public accession numbers and states that all data are included in the article, implying sequence reads/alignments were not deposited in a public repository."
38072961,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,"further HIV drug resistance tests of CSF and plasma (Sanger sequencing in Dongguan Medical Laboratory of Micro-scale and Presicion) presented identical results of major protease inhibitor (PI)-related mutations, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-related mutations, and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-related mutations.

38072961,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,2022 (sequencing performed during the relapse in mid-2022).,"A 27-year-old HIV-positive Chinese Manchu male complained of intermittent headache, nausea, and vomiting (non-projectile vomiting three times in total) for two weeks in January 2022. However, he complained of a headache relapse in June 2022. MRI showed the increased area of multifocal leukoencephalopathy (Fig. 1 C, c). Moreover, increased HIV replication was observed in both CNS and plasma, and further HIV drug resistance tests of CSF and plasma (Sanger sequencing...) presented identical results...",The timeline shows initial presentation in January 2022 and a relapse in June 2022 when higher viral loads were detected and Sanger sequencing for resistance was performed; thus sequencing was done in 2022 (during the June 2022 relapse).
38072961,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No indication that samples were cloned prior to sequencing; standard Sanger population genotyping was reported.,"further HIV drug resistance tests of CSF and plasma (Sanger sequencing in Dongguan Medical Laboratory of Micro-scale and Presicion) presented identical results of major protease inhibitor (PI)-related mutations, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-related mutations, and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-related mutations. The encephalitis owning to CSF drug-resistant HIV escape was considered.",The methods description specifies Sanger sequencing but does not mention cloning or single-genome amplification; this implies standard (population) Sanger sequencing rather than cloning-based sequencing.

Moreover, increased HIV replication was observed in both CNS and plasma, and further HIV drug resistance tests of CSF and plasma (Sanger sequencing...) presented identical results...",The article repeatedly describes viral load measurements and sequencing-based resistance testing performed on both CSF and plasma samples.
38072961,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Yes — sequencing was performed on samples from a patient experiencing virological failure/CSF viral escape while on ART.,"He initiated ART with tenofovir, lamivudine, and efavirenz, but treatment failure occurred one year later with plasma HIV RNA 2.19 × 10^5^ copies/mL and CD4+ T-cell count 14 cells/μL. However, he complained of a headache relapse in June 2022... booming viral loads were detected in both CSF (4580 copies/mL) and plasma (340 copies/mL) with consistent drug-resistant mutations.","The patient had prior documented treatment failure and at the time of sequencing had CSF and plasma viral replication despite being on ART (CSF viral escape), so sequences were obtained from an individual with virological failure."
38072961,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — this is an individual case report, not a clinical trial.",Learning from cerebrospinal fluid drug-resistant HIV escape-associated encephalitis: a case report. The authors received no specific funding for this work.,The article is a single-patient case report and contains no indication of trial enrollment or trial identifiers; funding and study type statements support this being an observational case description.
38072961,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes — the patient had prior ART exposure and sequencing was performed on samples from that patient.,"He initiated ART with tenofovir, lamivudine, and efavirenz, but treatment failure occurred one year later... the local doctor shifted the ART regimen to tenofovir, lamivudine, lopinavir/ritonavir without a genotypic drug resistance test, and his plasma HIV viral load was well controlled thereafter. Moreover, increased HIV replication was observed in both CNS and plasma, and further HIV drug resistance tests of CSF and plasma (Sanger sequencing...) presented identical results...","The sequencing was done on the single patient who had a documented history of antiretroviral drug exposure (multiple regimens), so sequences come from an ARV-experienced individual."
38072961,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), and protease inhibitors (PIs).","He initiated ART with tenofovir, lamivudine, and efavirenz... treatment failure occurred one year later... the local doctor shifted the ART regimen to tenofovir, lamivudine, lopinavir/ritonavir without a genotypic drug resistance test. Further HIV drug resistance tests... presented identical results of major protease inhibitor (PI)-related mutations, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-related mutations, and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-related mutations.","The described regimens include tenofovir and lamivudine (NRTIs), efavirenz (an NNRTI), and lopinavir/ritonavir (a PI combination), indicating exposure to NRTI, NNRTI and PI classes prior to the sequencing event."
38072961,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Tenofovir, lamivudine, efavirenz, and later lopinavir/ritonavir (tenofovir and lamivudine were continued across regimens).","He initiated ART with tenofovir, lamivudine, and efavirenz, but treatment failure occurred one year later... the local doctor shifted the ART regimen to tenofovir, lamivudine, lopinavir/ritonavir without a genotypic drug resistance test, and his plasma HIV viral load was well controlled thereafter. Moreover, increased HIV replication was observed in both CNS and plasma, and further HIV drug resistance tests of CSF and plasma (Sanger sequencing...) presented identical results...","The case history lists the specific drugs used before the sequencing: initial regimen tenofovir + lamivudine + efavirenz, followed by tenofovir + lamivudine + lopinavir/ritonavir; sequencing was performed after these exposures."
38140649,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,"We investigated the genetic diversity and prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) followed by phylogenetic analysis in 270 HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve individuals from Croatia in the period 2019--2022. HIV drug resistance analysis was performed on the viral sequences of 270 persons covering the RT/PR and IN regions.","The abstract and results explicitly state that viral sequences were obtained and analysed from 270 treatment-naïve individuals. The Methods describe RNA extraction from plasma and amplification/sequencing of pol gene regions (PR, RT, IN), confirming sequences derived from patient samples."
38140649,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No.,"Clinically relevant resistance to NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs, and INSTIs was evaluated with the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database, Genotypic Resistance Interpretation Algorithm version 9.5 and the IAS Drug Resistance Mutation list. Sequences were analysed for SDRMs and interpreted using genotypic algorithms and scoring; no phenotypic or in vitro susceptibility assays are described.","The paper describes genotypic analyses (sequence-based identification of DRMs and interpretation with Stanford/IAS lists) and reports prevalence of SDRMs. There is no description of phenotypic assays (e.g., recombinant virus phenotyping or in vitro susceptibility testing), so only genotypic (not in vitro phenotypic) susceptibility data were reported."
38140649,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,Yes.,All sequences obtained in this study by SS were submitted to the GeneBank nucleotide sequence database under accession numbers OR605755-OR606279 and OR613869-OR613875. Sequences generated by DS are available from the ArrayExpress database at EMBL-EBI under accession number E-MTAB-13563.,"The Data Availability Statement explicitly states that Sanger-sequenced sequences were submitted to GenBank (with accession ranges) and deep-sequencing data were deposited in ArrayExpress, indicating public availability."
38140649,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,OR605755-OR606279 and OR613869-OR613875.,All sequences obtained in this study by SS were submitted to the GeneBank nucleotide sequence database under accession numbers OR605755-OR606279 and OR613869-OR613875. Two sequences used to root trees are also reported with accession numbers OR606275 and OR606276 in the text.,"The Data Availability Statement provides the primary GenBank accession ranges for the Sanger sequences. Additional individual accession numbers (used in phylogenetic rooting) are mentioned in the Methods/Results, but the main reported GenBank ranges are OR605755-OR606279 and OR613869-OR613875."
38140649,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,270 individuals.,"We investigated the genetic diversity and prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) followed by phylogenetic analysis in 270 HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve individuals from Croatia in the period 2019--2022. A total of 270 persons met the inclusion criteria.","Both the abstract and Study Population sections state that 270 treatment-naïve persons were included and that HIV drug resistance analysis was performed on sequences from 270 persons, indicating 270 individuals had samples sequenced."
38140649,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Primarily Croatia (patients were newly diagnosed in and reported Croatia as country of infection).,"This study was conducted at the Department for Immunological and Molecular Diagnostics at UHID. Data collection and analysis were performed on HIV-1 RNA plasma samples collected from newly diagnosed HIV patients over a four-year period during the diagnostic process and clinical follow-up at UHID. Most of the patients originated from and reported Croatia as the country of infection and were included in the MSM risk group (94.8% and 85.6%, respectively).","The study population comprised newly diagnosed patients entering care at the Croatian Reference Centre (UHID) and most patients reported Croatia as the country of infection; thus the sequenced samples were obtained from patients in Croatia. Some background/non-local sequences were used for phylogenetic analyses, but the study samples are Croatian."
38140649,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,From 2019 to 2022.,"We investigated the genetic diversity and prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) ... in 270 HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve individuals from Croatia in the period 2019--2022. All newly diagnosed treatment-naïve PLHIV over 18 years who entered clinical care at UHID in the period between January 2019 and December 2022 ... were included in this study.",The abstract and Methods explicitly define the study period as January 2019 through December 2022; sequencing and analyses were performed on samples collected during this time.
38140649,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No (no cloning step reported).,"Nested PCR amplicons were purified and sequenced with a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit with a set of four primers for both sequencing regions to obtain bidirectional sequences. For NGS, amplicons for each sample were pooled and purified ... Sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina and sequenced on MiniSeq.","The Methods describe RT-PCR, nested PCR, purification and direct sequencing (Sanger) and preparation of NGS libraries from PCR amplicons. There is no description of molecular cloning of amplicons into vectors prior to sequencing, so samples were not cloned prior to sequencing."
38140649,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Protease (PR), partial reverse transcriptase (RT), and integrase (IN) regions of the pol gene.",Amplification of the HIV-1 pol gene was performed for two regions in two separate reactions: (1) sequencing of the HIV-1 protease and partial sequencing of the reverse transcriptase gene; and (2) sequencing of the HIV-1 integrase gene. HIV drug resistance analysis was performed on the viral sequences of 270 persons covering the RT/PR and IN regions.,"The Methods explicitly state sequencing targeted the pol gene, specifically protease, partial RT, and integrase regions; the Results reiterate analyses on RT/PR and IN regions."
38140649,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Sanger sequencing (BigDye Terminator) for initial genotyping and Illumina-based deep sequencing (MiniSeq) for NGS comparison.,"Nested PCR amplicons were purified and sequenced with a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit with a set of four primers for both sequencing regions to obtain bidirectional sequences. The whole HIV-1 protease region, part of the reverse transcriptase region, and the integrase region were sequenced on the Illumina platform using MiniSeq.","The Methods describe two sequencing approaches: Sanger sequencing of nested PCR amplicons (BigDye v3.1) and next-generation sequencing on Illumina MiniSeq for a subset of 60 samples, indicating both methods were used."
38140649,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma samples (HIV-1 RNA extracted from patient plasma).,Data collection and analysis were performed on HIV-1 RNA plasma samples collected from newly diagnosed HIV patients. At least 500 μL of the patient's plasma samples were concentrated ... and the remaining 140 μL was used for RNA extraction using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit.,"The Methods explicitly describe concentration and RNA extraction from plasma, confirming that plasma (HIV-1 RNA) samples were used for sequencing."
38140649,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,No.,"All newly diagnosed treatment-naïve PLHIV over 18 years who entered clinical care at UHID in the period between January 2019 and December 2022 ... were included in this study. We investigated ... 270 HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve individuals from Croatia in the period 2019--2022.","The cohort consisted exclusively of treatment-naïve, newly diagnosed persons; therefore no samples were from individuals experiencing virological failure while on ART."
38140649,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,No.,Data collection and analysis were performed on HIV-1 RNA plasma samples collected from newly diagnosed HIV patients over a four-year period during the diagnostic process and clinical follow-up at UHID. All newly diagnosed treatment-naïve PLHIV over 18 years who entered clinical care at UHID ... were included in this study.,"The study describes observational sampling during routine diagnostic and clinical follow-up at a reference centre, with no mention of enrollment in a clinical trial; thus patients were not part of a clinical trial."
38140649,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"No, sequences are from treatment-naïve individuals (no prior ARV).","We investigated the genetic diversity and prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) ... in 270 HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve individuals from Croatia in the period 2019--2022. All newly diagnosed treatment-naïve PLHIV over 18 years ... were included in this study.","Repeated statements that the cohort consisted of treatment-naïve, newly diagnosed persons indicate none had prior antiretroviral therapy before sample collection and sequencing."
38140649,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,None (participants were treatment-naïve).,"All newly diagnosed treatment-naïve PLHIV over 18 years who entered clinical care at UHID in the period between January 2019 and December 2022 ... were included in this study. We investigated ... 270 HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve individuals from Croatia in the period 2019--2022.","Because the study cohort was explicitly treatment-naïve, individuals had not received antiretroviral drug classes prior to sequencing; therefore no drug classes apply."
38140649,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,None (no antiretroviral drugs were received prior to sampling).,"All newly diagnosed treatment-naïve PLHIV over 18 years who entered clinical care at UHID in the period between January 2019 and December 2022 with plasma viraemia > 1000 HIV-1 RNA copies per ml were included in this study. We investigated the genetic diversity and prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) ... in 270 HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve individuals from Croatia in the period 2019--2022.","The repeated designation of participants as treatment-naïve confirms they had not been previously treated with specific antiretroviral drugs, so no individual drugs were received before sequencing."
38142692,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,No.,There was no routine testing for HIV drug resistance at the time of first-line ART virological failure in this setting. The absence of resistance testing in our cohort means we could not classify virological failures on the basis of drug-resistance mutations or ongoing poor adherence.,"The Methods explicitly state there was no routine testing for HIV drug resistance, and the Discussion reiterates that absence of resistance testing prevented classification by drug-resistance mutations. Because no resistance testing (which would include sequencing) was performed, the paper does not report HIV sequences from patient samples."
38142692,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No.,There was no routine testing for HIV drug resistance at the time of first-line ART virological failure in this setting. The absence of resistance testing in our cohort means we could not classify virological failures on the basis of drug-resistance mutations or ongoing poor adherence.,"In vitro drug susceptibility testing is part of resistance testing workflows; the paper states explicitly that no routine resistance testing was done and that they could not assess resistance. Therefore, no in vitro susceptibility data are reported."
38142692,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No.,There was no routine testing for HIV drug resistance at the time of first-line ART virological failure in this setting. We cannot publicly share the data used for this analysis because of the legal and ethical requirements regarding the use of routinely collected clinical data in South Africa.,"Because the study did not perform resistance testing or generate sequences, there were no sequences to deposit publicly. Additionally, the Data sharing statement says the underlying data cannot be publicly shared, reinforcing that no sequence data are available from this paper."
38142692,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported / not applicable.,There was no routine testing for HIV drug resistance at the time of first-line ART virological failure in this setting. The absence of resistance testing in our cohort means we could not classify virological failures on the basis of drug-resistance mutations or ongoing poor adherence.,"Because no sequencing or resistance testing was performed, the paper does not report any GenBank accession numbers."
38142692,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Zero (no individuals had samples sequenced).,There was no routine testing for HIV drug resistance at the time of first-line ART virological failure in this setting. The absence of resistance testing in our cohort means we could not classify virological failures on the basis of drug-resistance mutations or ongoing poor adherence.,"The paper explicitly states that resistance testing was not done in this cohort; therefore, no samples were obtained for sequencing and the count is zero."
38142692,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Not applicable (no sequences); study participants were from South Africa.,"We did a retrospective observational cohort study with de-identified, routinely collected data from South Africa's ART programme in 59 of approximately 100 public sector primary health-care clinics in the eThekwini Municipality of the KwaZulu-Natal province. Our study population included all people living with HIV aged 15 years or older who were switched to a second-line ART between Dec 1, 2019, and Nov 30, 2020.","No sequencing was performed, so there are no sequenced samples to assign to any country. The study cohort, however, was drawn from clinics in eThekwini Municipality, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa."
38142692,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Not applicable (no sequences); study sample period was Dec 1, 2019 to Nov 30, 2020.","Our study population included all people living with HIV aged 15 years or older who were switched to a second-line ART between Dec 1, 2019, and Nov 30, 2020. We used this baseline period of switching to second-line therapy to allow a minimum follow-up duration of 12 months plus 90 days before the data cutoff on April 21, 2022.","Because no sequencing was done, there are no sequenced-sample collection years. The relevant study timeframe for participant sampling and switching was Dec 2019 to Nov 2020."
38142692,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No (not applicable — no sequencing was performed).,There was no routine testing for HIV drug resistance at the time of first-line ART virological failure in this setting. The absence of resistance testing in our cohort means we could not classify virological failures on the basis of drug-resistance mutations or ongoing poor adherence.,"Cloning prior to sequencing is part of sequencing workflows; since the study did not perform resistance testing or sequencing, no cloning occurred."
38142692,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,None (no genes sequenced / not applicable).,There was no routine testing for HIV drug resistance at the time of first-line ART virological failure in this setting. The absence of resistance testing in our cohort means we could not classify virological failures on the basis of drug-resistance mutations or ongoing poor adherence.,"The paper states that no resistance testing was performed, so no HIV genes were sequenced or reported."
38142692,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Not applicable — no sequencing methods reported.,There was no routine testing for HIV drug resistance at the time of first-line ART virological failure in this setting. The absence of resistance testing in our cohort means we could not classify virological failures on the basis of drug-resistance mutations or ongoing poor adherence.,"Because no sequencing was undertaken, the paper does not describe any sequencing methodology."
38142692,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Not applicable — no samples were sequenced. (Viral load testing was performed on plasma as part of routine care.),"Viral load was routinely taken at 6 and 12 months after ART initiation and every 12 months thereafter, unless viraemia occurred. Of 941 participants who were retained in care at 12 months, 799 (85%) had a viral load done at a median of 357 days (IQR 293--418).","Although viral load testing (which uses plasma) was done as part of routine care, the study did not perform sequencing on samples. Therefore, no sequenced sample types are reported; the only sample-related data are routine viral load measurements."
38142692,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,No sequences were obtained.,Virological failure was defined as two consecutive viral loads of ≥1000 copies per mL at least 56 days apart. There was no routine testing for HIV drug resistance at the time of first-line ART virological failure in this setting.,"The cohort comprised individuals with virological failure by the stated definition, but the paper makes clear that no resistance testing or sequencing was performed on these individuals, so no sequences were obtained."
38142692,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — this was a retrospective observational cohort study using routine-care data, not a clinical trial.","In this retrospective observational cohort study, we used routinely collected, de-identified data from 59 primary health-care facilities in eThekwini Municipality, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Although clinical trials are discussed in the Discussion (eg, DAWNING, NADIA), our study is described as routine-care observational work rather than a trial.","The Methods explicitly label the study as a retrospective observational cohort using routinely collected program data, so participants were not enrolled in a clinical trial as part of this study."
38142692,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,No sequences reported; study participants had prior ARV exposure (mostly first-line TDF/XTC/EFV).,"Almost all participants previously received first-line TDF/XTC/EFV (n=1198, 99%). There was no routine testing for HIV drug resistance at the time of first-line ART virological failure in this setting.","Although the cohort comprised individuals who had previously received antiretroviral therapy (first-line regimens specified), the paper did not perform sequencing on these individuals, so it does not report HIV sequences from them."
38142692,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).,We included only people who were previously receiving standard first-line regimens of TDF/XTC/EFV or TDF/XTC/NVP at the time of virological failure. Dolutegravir (DTG) is recommended for second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) after virological failure on first-line non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimens.,"First-line regimens reported were combinations of TDF (an NRTI) with XTC (emtricitabine or lamivudine, NRTIs) plus EFV or NVP (both NNRTIs). Thus, participants had received NRTIs and NNRTIs prior to any (non-existent) sequencing."
38142692,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), emtricitabine or lamivudine (XTC), and efavirenz (EFV) or nevirapine (NVP) as first-line therapy.","We included only people who were previously receiving standard first-line regimens of TDF/XTC/EFV or TDF/XTC/NVP at the time of virological failure. Almost all participants previously received first-line TDF/XTC/EFV (n=1198, 99%).","The Methods and Results specify the exact first-line drug combinations participants were on at virological failure: TDF plus XTC (emtricitabine or lamivudine) with either efavirenz or nevirapine. Because no sequencing was done, these drugs describe prior ARV exposure but not sequencing-related samples."
38140667,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,No. This article is a literature review and does not report new HIV sequences from patient samples.,No new data were created or analyzed in this study. Data sharing is not applicable to this article.,"The paper is a comprehensive literature review that synthesizes published studies rather than performing original sequencing; the Data Availability Statement explicitly says no new data were created or analyzed, indicating the authors did not generate or report primary sequence data themselves."
38140667,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No. The paper does not present original in vitro drug susceptibility data; it only references published findings and in vitro passage experiments reported elsewhere.,"While mentioning that mutations outside of the integrase gene have been reported in vitro from passage experiments using DTG, the review itself states: ""No new data were created or analyzed in this study."" ""Data sharing is not applicable to this article.""","The review refers to in vitro passage experiments from other work but, as a secondary analysis of the literature, does not present new laboratory in vitro susceptibility assays or results of such assays."
38140667,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No. The paper did not generate new sequences and therefore did not deposit sequences in public repositories.,No new data were created or analyzed in this study. Data sharing is not applicable to this article.,"Because the article is a literature review and explicitly states no new data were created or analyzed, there are no new sequences from this paper to be made publicly available."
38140667,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported. The review does not provide any GenBank accession numbers because it did not generate new sequence data.,No new data were created or analyzed in this study. Data sharing is not applicable to this article.,"GenBank accession numbers would pertain to newly deposited sequences; since the paper contains no new sequence data, it does not list accession numbers."
38140667,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,The review itself did not obtain samples; numbers of sequenced/genotyped individuals vary by the included studies (examples: 34 plasma samples sequenced in a Botswana study; 89 individuals successfully genotyped in a Malawi study; 167 genotypes obtained in a Mozambique study).,"A study evaluated resistance in people living with HIV-1 subtype C ... Plasma samples from 34 individuals were sequenced and 11 (32.4%) had INSTI RAMs. In 2018, Malawi ... 89 of them were successfully genotyped. A study ... in Mozambique ... identified VF in 216 individuals and successfully obtained genotypes from 167.","The article is a synthesis of many primary studies; it did not itself collect samples. Counts of individuals with sequences are reported within individual cited studies, so total numbers vary by study (examples are provided from the review)."
38140667,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Sequenced samples reported in the reviewed studies came from multiple countries, including (but not limited to) France, Canada, Tanzania, Malawi, Brazil, Nigeria, Mozambique, Botswana, South Africa, Italy, Germany, Spain, Ukraine, and Poland.","One multicenter study in France evaluated RAMs ... Of the 3219 individuals receiving DTG-based regimens ... In a Canadian database study of 928 individuals ... Two multicenter studies described the transition ... In Tanzania in March 2019 ... In 2018, Malawi ... A study based on database searches investigated 113 treatment-naive individuals ... in Brazil. A single-hospital study in Nigeria ... A study ... in Mozambique ... evaluated resistance ... in Botswana ... In a separate South African cohort ... A 6-year retrospective study in Germany ... In a Spanish cohort ... Among 955 people living with HIV in Ukraine and Poland ...",The review aggregates data from many real-world cohorts and studies across regions; the Results section explicitly names numerous countries where primary studies and sequencing/genotyping were performed.
38140667,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,The review covers publications and congress data from 2013 to 2023 and includes primary studies with sampling years spanning at least 2012 through 2022 (examples: a French study 2019–2022; a Canadian study 2012–2014; German samples from 2017–July 2022).,"Here, we conducted a comprehensive review ... using publications and congress data from 2013 to 2023. One multicenter study in France evaluated RAMs ... from 2019 to 2022. In a Canadian database study ... between 2012 and 2014. A 6-year retrospective study in Germany included 655 (2017--2018), 710 (2019--2020), and 667 (2021--July 2022) samples ...","The review timeframe is 2013–2023 and it cites individual studies with explicit sampling years; therefore, sampled data in the cited studies span approximately 2012–2022 as illustrated by the examples."
38140667,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not reported in this review. The paper does not provide details indicating that samples were cloned prior to sequencing.,"No new data were created or analyzed in this study. Data sharing is not applicable to this article. The Results and Methods describe extraction of published data (e.g., genotypes obtained, plasma samples sequenced) but do not report cloning procedures.","Because this is a secondary literature review, the manuscript does not consistently present primary laboratory methods (such as cloning versus direct PCR/Sanger or NGS). Where the primary studies might have used cloning, those procedural specifics are not described in this review."
38140667,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Primarily the integrase gene (INSTI-associated mutations) and, in many studies, reverse transcriptase and protease regions (RT and PR) were also reported/sequenced.","Our review showed that RAMs conferring resistance to DTG were rare ... The RAMs detected after virologic failure ... were G118R, E138K, G140A/C/R/S, Q148H/K/R, N155H, and R263K. Among the 82 individuals receiving DTG-based regimens, 4 (4.9%) had at least 1 major INSTI RAM ... The 3 individuals with major INSTI RAMs with reverse transcriptase--protease sequences available also had multiple NNRTI mutations and mutations that conferred resistance to 3TC and TDF.","The review focuses on integrase resistance-associated mutations (i.e., integrase gene sequencing) and frequently references accompanying reverse transcriptase and protease genotypes from primary studies, indicating those genes were commonly sequenced in the cited reports."
38140667,10,What method was used for sequencing?,"Not specified in this review. The paper does not uniformly report sequencing methodologies (e.g., Sanger versus next-generation sequencing) used in the primary studies.",Data were extracted independently by 4 individuals using standardized spreadsheets for manuscripts and congress abstracts. The Results describe genotypes obtained and plasma samples sequenced but do not detail sequencing platforms or methods. No new data were created or analyzed in this study.,"As a literature review, the article summarizes resistance findings without providing standardized methodological details across studies; sequencing platform/method is not specified in the review text."
38140667,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Viral plasma samples (from viremic individuals) were sequenced/genotyped in the primary studies cited in the review.,Plasma samples from 34 individuals were sequenced and 11 (32.4%) had INSTI RAMs. A prospective observational study ... reported that 163/1892 (8.6%) were viremic (HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL) at baseline; 89 of them were successfully genotyped. In Mozambique ... identified VF in 216 individuals and successfully obtained genotypes from 167.,"The review repeatedly refers to plasma samples, viremic individuals, and genotyping of viral RNA, indicating that plasma-derived viral sequences were the sample type used in the primary studies."
38140667,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Yes. Many of the cited studies obtained sequences from individuals experiencing virologic failure on DTG-based or other INSTI-containing regimens.,"Plasma samples from 34 individuals were sequenced and 11 (32.4%) had INSTI RAMs; of these, 8 had treatment failure on a DTG-based regimen at resistance sampling. In a single-hospital study in Nigeria ... among 4263 people living with HIV and on a DTG-based regimen for at least 6 months, 281 (6.6%) had a viral load >1000 copies/mL. From this group, resistance testing was completed in 33 individuals on TLD ...",The review focuses on treatment-emergent resistance and explicitly describes genotyping and sequencing performed on samples from individuals with virologic failure (VF) in multiple primary studies.
38140667,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — this paper is a literature review of real-world cohorts, case studies, and some clinical trials; the patients discussed come from a mix of study types, but the review itself does not enroll patients in a trial.","We performed a comprehensive search ... to identify studies that reported DTG resistance-associated mutations ... Papers and abstracts were reviewed ... filtered by relevant study type (real-world evidence study, case study, or systematic review/meta-analysis). Randomized non-inferiority trial ... detected in 3/95 (3.2%) participants receiving DTG monotherapy.","The manuscript synthesizes data from many sources (real-world studies, case studies, and some randomized trials cited), but it is not a primary clinical trial and did not enroll or randomize patients itself."
38140667,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"Yes. The review includes many sequences/genotypes from treatment-experienced individuals, including those with prior exposure to NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs, and first-generation INSTIs (RAL, EVG).","Our review showed that RAMs conferring resistance to DTG were rare ... The RAMs detected after virologic failure, often in heavily treatment-experienced individuals with prior exposure to integrase strand transfer inhibitors, were G118R, E138K, ... Based on data from a large Italian cohort in the ARCA database, RAMs were evaluated in 107 INSTI-experienced viremic people living with HIV.","The review repeatedly describes findings from heavily treatment-experienced (HTE) populations and individuals with prior ART or first-generation INSTI exposure, indicating that many sequences reported in the cited studies derive from people with prior ARV exposure."
38140667,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Individuals had received multiple drug classes prior to sequencing, including nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs).","Mutations conferring resistance to INSTIs, NNRTIs, and NRTIs were detected in 5.8%, 62.8%, and 44.5% of all individuals, respectively. The 3 individuals with major INSTI RAMs with reverse transcriptase--protease sequences available also had multiple NNRTI mutations and mutations that conferred resistance to 3TC and TDF. In addition to multiple INSTI RAMs ... this individual showed high-level resistance to NNRTIs and NRTIs.","The review documents resistance and prior exposure across the major ARV classes (NRTI, NNRTI, PI, INSTI) in the cited cohorts, reflecting prior use of these drug classes among sequenced individuals."
38140667,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Specific drugs mentioned in the review include dolutegravir (DTG), raltegravir (RAL), elvitegravir (EVG), lamivudine (3TC), abacavir (ABC), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC), rilpivirine (RPV), and others referenced as components of regimens.","Dolutegravir (DTG) use in various antiretroviral therapy combinations ... Two large cohort studies described VF and emergent resistance with DTG/3TC/ABC. In a Canadian database study ... 392 were on a DTG-based regimen with a 3TC + ABC or TDF + FTC/3TC backbone. First-generation INSTIs (RAL and EVG) have a relatively low barrier to resistance, and people living with HIV with prior exposure to these drugs can develop RAMs that also confer resistance to DTG. The French Dat'AIDS multicenter cohort reported INSTI resistance outcomes in individuals who switched to DTG/RPV (n = 799) and DTG + XTC (n = 575).","The review names regimen components and specific drugs across the cited studies (DTG, RAL, EVG, 3TC, ABC, TDF, FTC, RPV), indicating these drugs were used prior to or during the sampling events reported in the primary literature summarized."
38140553,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes. The paper reports HIV-1 sequences obtained from patient samples (partial pol sequences covering protease and part of reverse transcriptase).,"The material of the study were blood plasma collections (n = 2502), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (lymphocytes) collections (n = 613), and frozen whole blood collections (n = 63) obtained from HIV-infected patients at federal and regional centers for HIV/AIDS prevention (AIDS Centers) as part of molecular genetic monitoring of the HIV epidemic in Russia in the period from 2011 to 2020. We analyzed sequences and their associated demographic and epidemiological data. The sequences covered the HIV-1 protease (PR) and part of the reverse transcriptase (RT).","The Methods explicitly state that biological samples (plasma, PBMCs, whole blood) were obtained from HIV-infected patients and that sequences were analyzed. The paper repeatedly refers to the analysis of 3178 partial pol (PR-RT) sequences from patients, indicating these are patient-derived viral sequences."
38140553,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No. The paper reports genotypic drug resistance (DRM) analysis but does not report in vitro phenotypic drug susceptibility assays.,"In this study, we performed drug resistance analysis among HIV-infected patients not on ART, infected with both viruses of ""pure"" subtypes and its recombinant forms. The analysis utilized Stanford University's HIVdb database tool and the Calibrated Population Resistance Tool (CPR).","The methods and results describe genotypic analysis using sequencing and bioinformatic tools (Stanford HIVdb, CPR) to identify DRMs and estimate primary resistance. There is no description of phenotypic assays or in vitro susceptibility testing methods (e.g., phenotypic assays, culture-based IC50/EC50 measurements), so no in vitro drug susceptibility data were reported."
38140553,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,Yes. All nucleotide sequences obtained were deposited in the Los Alamos HIV sequence database.,All nucleotide sequences obtained in the study were deposited in the international database of the Los Alamos laboratory. All nucleotide sequences obtained in the study were deposited in the international database of the Los Alamos laboratory ( Supplemental Table S4 ).,"The Data Availability Statement and the Discussion explicitly state that the study's nucleotide sequences were deposited in the Los Alamos Laboratory database, indicating public availability via that repository."
38140553,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,GenBank accession numbers for the study sequences are not reported. The paper states sequences were deposited in the Los Alamos database but does not provide GenBank accession numbers.,"All nucleotide sequences obtained in the study were deposited in the international database of the Los Alamos laboratory. In the Methods and Data Availability sections the authors reference deposition in the Los Alamos database and Supplemental Table S4, but no GenBank accession identifiers are provided in the text.","The manuscript specifies deposition in the Los Alamos database and cites a supplemental table for deposited sequences, but it does not list any GenBank accession numbers. The only GenBank accession mentioned in the text is K03455, which refers to the HXB-2 reference sequence used for numbering, not to study isolates."
38140553,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,3178 individuals (3178 partial pol sequences).,"A comprehensive examination was conducted, encompassing 3178 partial pol sequences. The genotyping results of 3178 HIV-infected patients from seven Russian federal districts (FDs) were examined.","The manuscript repeatedly states that 3178 partial pol sequences (genotyping results) were analyzed and that these correspond to 3178 HIV-infected patients, so the number of individuals sampled for sequencing is 3178."
38140553,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,The sequenced samples were obtained from patients in the Russian Federation (various federal districts of Russia).,The material of the study were blood plasma collections ... obtained from HIV-infected patients at federal and regional centers for HIV/AIDS prevention (AIDS Centers) as part of molecular genetic monitoring of the HIV epidemic in Russia in the period from 2011 to 2020. The genotyping results of 3178 HIV-infected patients from seven Russian federal districts (FDs) were examined.,"The study population and sample collection are described as coming from federal and regional AIDS Centers in Russia, and the results analyze sequences from seven Russian federal districts; thus the sequenced samples originated from the Russian Federation."
38140553,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,Samples were obtained in the period 2011–2020.,"The material of the study were ... obtained from HIV-infected patients at federal and regional centers for HIV/AIDS prevention (AIDS Centers) as part of molecular genetic monitoring of the HIV epidemic in Russia in the period from 2011 to 2020. The overall prevalence of PrimDR in patients not on ART with the 2011--2020 sampling years was 7.4% (95% CI, 6.2--8.9%).","The Methods explicitly state the sampling period as 2011 to 2020, and analyses (e.g., temporal trends, PrimDR estimates) refer to the 2011–2020 sampling years."
38140553,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,No. Samples were amplified by nested PCR and directly Sanger-sequenced; no cloning step is reported.,Amplification of HIV-1 pol gene fragments was performed automatically by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method according to the protocols presented in Table 1. Sanger-based sequencing of the HIV pol gene regions encoding the PR-RT ... was performed. The sequencing reaction in the ViroSeq system was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol.,"The Methods describe reverse transcription (for RNA), nested PCR amplification, purification, and direct Sanger sequencing (ViroSeq/BigDye). There is no mention of cloning of PCR products into vectors or cloning prior to sequencing, so sequencing appears to have been performed directly on PCR amplicons."
38140553,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,The pol gene region: HIV-1 protease (PR) and part of reverse transcriptase (RT) were sequenced.,"We analyzed sequences and their associated demographic and epidemiological data. The sequences covered the HIV-1 protease (PR) and part of the reverse transcriptase (RT). Sanger-based sequencing of the HIV pol gene regions encoding the PR-RT (2253--3554 bp according to the HXB-2 strain, GenBank accession number K03455) was performed.","The manuscript clearly states that sequencing targeted the pol gene region encompassing protease and part of reverse transcriptase (PR-RT), giving HXB2 coordinates, so those are the genes/regions sequenced."
38140553,10,What method was used for sequencing?,Sanger sequencing (BigDye Terminator v3.1 and ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System) of PCR amplicons was used.,"Sanger-based sequencing of the HIV pol gene regions encoding the PR-RT ... was performed. Sequencing reaction for amplification protocols A and B (Table 1) was performed using BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (""Applied Biosystems"", Waltham, MT, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequencing reaction in the ViroSeq system was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol.","Methods specify Sanger-based sequencing using BigDye Terminator chemistry and the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System; sequence processing used Sequencing Analysis Software and ViroSeq Genotyping Software, indicating classical Sanger sequencing workflow."
38140553,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,"Blood plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (lymphocytes), and frozen whole blood samples were sequenced (RNA from plasma and DNA from lymphocytes/whole blood as appropriate).","The material of the study were blood plasma collections (n = 2502), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (lymphocytes) collections (n = 613), and frozen whole blood collections (n = 63) obtained from HIV-infected patients. The ViroSeqTM HIV-1 Genotyping System kit ... was used for RNA extraction from blood plasma samples. Commercial kit (the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit) was used for DNA extraction from lymphocytes and frozen whole blood.","The Methods describe sample types (plasma, PBMCs/lymphocytes, frozen whole blood) and extraction methods for RNA (plasma) and DNA (lymphocytes/whole blood), indicating these were the sample types used for sequencing."
38140553,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,"Not explicitly reported. The paper states sequences came from patients both receiving ART and not on ART, but it does not explicitly state which sequences were from individuals with virological failure.","Despite these constraints, we posit that our analysis, encompassing 3178 sequences from HIV-infected patients both receiving ART and not on ART, serves as a crucial component of the molecular genetic monitoring of the HIV infection from 2011 to 2020. In this study, we performed drug resistance analysis among HIV-infected patients not on ART (N = 1494) ...","While the manuscript indicates that the sample set included patients on ART and patients not on ART, there is no explicit statement describing virological failure status (e.g., detectable viral load on therapy or treatment failure) or that sequences were specifically obtained from individuals experiencing virological failure. Therefore, VF status is not clearly reported."
38140553,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No. Patients were sampled as part of routine molecular genetic monitoring at federal and regional AIDS Centers, not as participants in a clinical trial.",The material of the study were blood plasma collections ... obtained from HIV-infected patients at federal and regional centers for HIV/AIDS prevention (AIDS Centers) as part of molecular genetic monitoring of the HIV epidemic in Russia in the period from 2011 to 2020. Informed consent was signed by all HIV-infected patients included in the study in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.,The study describes sample collection as part of molecular genetic monitoring programs at AIDS Centers and does not describe enrollment in any clinical trial or trial identifiers; thus participants were not reported to be in a clinical trial.
38140553,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,"Partially. The cohort includes patients both receiving ART and not on ART at the time of sampling, but the authors state they could not reliably determine past treatment history for all patients.","Despite these constraints, we posit that our analysis, encompassing 3178 sequences from HIV-infected patients both receiving ART and not on ART, serves as a crucial component of the molecular genetic monitoring of the HIV infection from 2011 to 2020. Since we could not estimate the duration of patients' infection and the possibility of their treatment in the past, and only knew that they were not receiving ART at the time of genotype analysis, we decided not to call this pretreatment drug resistance or transmitted drug resistance, and introduced the general name of primary resistance (PrimDR) in this context.","The manuscript indicates the dataset contains sequences from patients on ART (so they had current ARV exposure) and from patients not on ART. However, the authors explicitly note uncertainty about past treatment history for some patients not currently on ART, so while sequences from patients with prior ARV exposure likely exist, prior ARV receipt is not fully documented for all individuals."
38140553,15,Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Individual-level drug class histories are not systematically reported. The study's resistance analyses focus on protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and discussion references use of NNRTIs and NRTIs in Russian first-line regimens.","We investigated the prevalence of PrimDR and individual DRMs in PR-RT sequences derived from HIV-infected patients not on ART (N = 1494) concerning PIs, NRTIs, and NNRTIs. The presence of K103N is primary conditioned by the use of EFV as part of the preferred first-line therapy regimen in Russia. It is also worth noting that the K103N mutation is not associated with a major impact on viral fitness...","The paper reports DRM analyses for PIs, NRTIs and NNRTIs and discusses national treatment practices (e.g., use of efavirenz and lamivudine/emtricitabine), indicating exposure in the population to NNRTIs and NRTIs and potential exposure to PIs. However, the manuscript does not provide systematic, individual-level lists of drug classes each participant received prior to sequencing."
38140553,16,Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?,"Specific individual drug regimens are not reported. The manuscript mentions commonly used drugs/regimens in Russia such as efavirenz (EFV), lamivudine (3TC), emtricitabine (FTC), and discusses dolutegravir (DTG) as later introduced, but it does not provide participant-level drug lists.","The presence of K103N is primary conditioned by the use of EFV as part of the preferred first-line therapy regimen in Russia. It is also worth noting that the K103N mutation ... The heightened prevalence of the M184V mutation was noted within sub-subtype A6 (p = 0.018). This can be explained by the wide distribution of this HIV-1 genetic variant and the use of 3TC and FTC as the main components of the preferred first-line therapy regimens in Russia. Thus, in December 2020, the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation approved the clinical recommendations ""HIV infection in adults"", in which DTG was included in one of the three options of preferred first-line ART regimens for adults along with EFV and ESV.","The text names specific drugs used in Russian first-line therapy (EFV, 3TC, FTC, and later DTG) to explain observed DRMs, but it does not list which drugs individual study participants received. Therefore, while common drugs in the treated population are mentioned, participant-level drug exposure prior to sequencing is not reported."
38090027,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,"A validated in-house method was used to identify resistance-associated mutations (RAMs), as previously described by our group. GRT on plasma HIV-RNA and PBMC HIV-DNA was interpreted according to the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database version 9.0.","The Methods state that genotypic resistance testing (GRT) was performed on patient specimens (plasma HIV-RNA and PBMC HIV-DNA) using a validated in-house method to identify resistance-associated mutations. The Results also describe that GRTs were attempted/evaluable in patients with virological failure, indicating sequences (or at least genotypic data) were obtained from patient samples."
38090027,2,Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?,No.,"A validated in-house method was used to identify resistance-associated mutations (RAMs), as previously described by our group. When genotypic resistance testing was feasible, there was no evidence of emerging resistance to integrase inhibitors, emtricitabine (or lamivudine), or tenofovir.","The paper describes genotypic resistance testing and interpretation via the Stanford database (genotype-based inference of susceptibility), but it does not report any phenotypic or in vitro susceptibility assays (no mention of phenotypic assays, fold-change data, or culture-based drug susceptibility testing). Therefore, in vitro drug susceptibility data were not reported."
38090027,3,Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?,No (not reported).,"GRT on plasma HIV-RNA and PBMC HIV-DNA was interpreted according to the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database version 9.0 (hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-sequences/, last updated on 22 June 2023). Mainy due to the low values of viremia at VF, genotypic resistance tests (GRTs) were able to evaluate the drug resistance at VF only in five patients: none selected variants resistant to integrase inhibitors and no new mutations emerged in any case (Table 2).","The manuscript describes genotypic testing and interpretation but does not provide any statement about depositing sequences in public repositories (no GenBank accession numbers or similar). The reference to the Stanford database is about interpretation, not sequence deposition. Therefore, there is no evidence sequences were made publicly available."
38090027,4,What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?,None reported.,"A validated in-house method was used to identify resistance-associated mutations (RAMs), as previously described by our group. Mainy due to the low values of viremia at VF, genotypic resistance tests (GRTs) were able to evaluate the drug resistance at VF only in five patients: none selected variants resistant to integrase inhibitors and no new mutations emerged in any case (Table 2).","The paper does not list any GenBank accession numbers or other repository identifiers for sequences. Given the absence of accession numbers or statements of deposition, no GenBank accessions were reported."
38090027,5,How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?,Five patients had evaluable genotypic resistance tests.,"Mainy due to the low values of viremia at VF, genotypic resistance tests (GRTs) were able to evaluate the drug resistance at VF only in five patients: none selected variants resistant to integrase inhibitors and no new mutations emerged in any case (Table 2). GRTs were fully amplifiable only in one case and resulted in susceptibility to all NRTIs, InSTIs, and PIs; in another case, switched to DcFTAF, GRTs were performed but analysis was feasible only for PIs, with full susceptibility.","The Results explicitly state that GRT was evaluable in only five patients due to low viremia, and describe the outcomes of those tests. Therefore, sequencing/genotypic testing was effectively obtained for five individuals."
38090027,6,From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?,Italy.,"Individuals provided written informed consent on the use of their data in scientific analyses and to be included in the Centro San Luigi (CSL) HIV Cohort. The CSL-HIV Cohort was approved by the Ethics Committee of the IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute (Milan, Italy; date of approval 4 December 2017, protocol n. 34).","The study cohort is the Centro San Luigi (CSL) HIV Cohort and the ethics approval is from an institution in Milan, Italy. The paper refers to results consistent with observational studies in ""our country,"" indicating the work was performed in Italy; thus sequences/samples derive from Italian patients."
38090027,7,From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?,"Sequencing (GRT) was performed during the study follow-up period, with patient switches from June 2019 to June 2021 and follow-up/data freeze through 31 August 2022 (so samples were obtained during 2019–2022).","The retrospective cohort study, which included adult treatment-experienced and virologically suppressed PLWH, switched to BFTAF from June 2019 to June 2021. Follow-up accrued from the start of BFTAF (baseline) up to the stop of any drug in the regimen or lost to follow-up or data freezing (31 August 2022).","The paper does not give specific calendar years for each sequencing event, but GRTs were performed at virological failure during the study observation window. Since patients switched between June 2019 and June 2021 and follow-up continued until data freeze on 31 August 2022, any sequencing done as part of this work would have been obtained within that 2019–2022 period."
38090027,8,Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?,Not reported / No evidence of cloning.,"A validated in-house method was used to identify resistance-associated mutations (RAMs), as previously described by our group. Mainy due to the low values of viremia at VF, genotypic resistance tests (GRTs) were able to evaluate the drug resistance at VF only in five patients.","The Methods describe an in-house genotypic resistance method but give no indication that cloning of viral sequences was performed prior to sequencing (no mention of cloning, molecular cloning, or single-genome amplification). Therefore cloning was not reported."
38090027,9,Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?,"Protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase regions were assayed (i.e., PR, RT and IN).","When genotypic resistance testing was feasible, there was no evidence of emerging resistance to integrase inhibitors, emtricitabine (or lamivudine), or tenofovir. GRTs were fully amplifiable only in one case and resulted in susceptibility to all NRTIs, InSTIs, and PIs; in another case ... analysis was feasible only for PIs, with full susceptibility.","The results discuss resistance and susceptibility relative to drug classes that map to specific genes: integrase inhibitors (integrase gene), NRTIs/NNRTIs (reverse transcriptase gene), and protease inhibitors (protease gene). Although the Methods do not explicitly list gene names, interpretation for PIs, NRTIs and InSTIs indicates that protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase regions were the targets of genotyping."
38090027,10,What method was used for sequencing?,A validated in-house genotypic resistance testing method was used (details not specified in this paper).,"A validated in-house method was used to identify resistance-associated mutations (RAMs), as previously described by our group. GRT on plasma HIV-RNA and PBMC HIV-DNA was interpreted according to the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database version 9.0.","The Methods section indicates use of an in-house validated method for identifying RAMs, but the paper does not provide technical details (e.g., Sanger sequencing, NGS, primers). It refers to previous descriptions by the group for methodological details, so only a validated in-house GRT approach is reported here."
38090027,11,What type of samples were sequenced?,Plasma HIV-RNA and PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cell) HIV-DNA.,"GRT on plasma HIV-RNA and PBMC HIV-DNA was interpreted according to the Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database version 9.0. Mainy due to the low values of viremia at VF, genotypic resistance tests (GRTs) were able to evaluate the drug resistance at VF only in five patients.","The Methods explicitly state that genotypic resistance testing was performed on plasma HIV-RNA and PBMC HIV-DNA, so those are the sample types used for sequencing/genotyping."
38090027,12,Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?,Yes — GRTs were performed/evaluable in five patients who experienced virological failure.,"Mainy due to the low values of viremia at VF, genotypic resistance tests (GRTs) were able to evaluate the drug resistance at VF only in five patients: none selected variants resistant to integrase inhibitors and no new mutations emerged in any case (Table 2). Out of the 44 documented VF, in 33 cases (75%) BFTAF was successfully maintained with spontaneous virological re-suppression in at least two subsequent HIV-RNA determinations.","The paper states that genotypic resistance tests were attempted in cases of virological failure and that for five VF cases GRT evaluation was possible, indicating sequences/genotypic data were obtained from individuals experiencing VF while on treatment."
38090027,13,Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?,"No — this was an observational, retrospective cohort in routine clinical practice (though a small number later enrolled in clinical trials).","Analysis of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BFTAF) efficacy and safety in virologically suppressed people living with HIV (PLWH) in clinical practice. The retrospective cohort study, which included adult treatment-experienced and virologically suppressed PLWH, switched to BFTAF from June 2019 to June 2021. The discontinuation of BFTAF occurred due to simplification to a regimen with a lower drug burden in 70 (44.9%) patients ... due to enrolment in clinical trials in 8 (5.1%).","The study is described as a retrospective cohort in clinical practice rather than a clinical trial. The Results note that 8 patients discontinued due to enrolment in clinical trials, indicating that while most participants were not in trials, a small subset later joined trials; overall the study itself was not a clinical trial."
38090027,14,Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?,Yes.,"The retrospective cohort study, which included adult treatment-experienced and virologically suppressed PLWH, switched to BFTAF from June 2019 to June 2021. At the beginning of BFTAF treatment, the median age (Q1-Q3) was 51.1 (42--57.1) years; patients had a known HIV infection lasting 13.8 (6.8--23.4) years and were on ART for 10.2 (5.1--19.7) years.",The cohort is explicitly treatment-experienced with long prior ART exposure; genotypic resistance testing was performed on these patients at virological failure. Therefore sequences/genotypic data derive from individuals with prior antiretroviral drug exposure.

38152686,1,Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?,Yes.,"ART was switched to TDF/3TC/EFZ, and genotyping was requested, which revealed H51Y and E157Q mutations, which are associated with resistance to INIs, including DTG, and K70E and M184V mutations in the reverse transcriptase genes. In the present case report, the pharmacokinetic interaction between rifampicin and DTG, which was used at a low dose (50 mg/day), may have contributed to subinhibitory tissue levels and the emergence of resistance mutations.","The paper states that genotyping was requested and specific resistance-associated mutations (H51Y, E157Q in integrase and K70E, M184V in reverse transcriptase) were detected from the patient, which indicates HIV sequence/genotype information was obtained from the patient's sample."
