{"pmid": "37878637", "updates": {"1": "Question: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\n\nEvidence: Not provided.\n\nRationale: The underlying paper text was not available for verification. The original extraction indicated sequences from patient samples. Because no paper text is available to contradict that and this answer is consistent with subsequent answers (e.g., genes sequenced, sample type), I retain the original categorical answer. If during full-text review no clinical sample sequencing is described this should be changed to \"No.\" \n\nAnswer: Yes", "2": "Question: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\n\nEvidence: Not provided.\n\nRationale: No methods or results text was available to confirm phenotypic assays, IC50/EC50 values, or named phenotyping platforms. The original extraction stated no in vitro susceptibility data. Per the curation rules, in the absence of explicit phenotypic assay reporting the correct categorical response is \"No.\" \n\nAnswer: No", "3": "Question: Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?\n\nEvidence: Not provided.\n\nRationale: The paper text and any data availability statement were not provided to confirm deposition. The original extraction answered \"No.\" In absence of evidence of deposition or accession numbers, the appropriate categorical answer is \"No.\" If a deposition statement or accession numbers appear in the paper, this should be updated to \"Yes.\" \n\nAnswer: No", "4": "Question: What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?\n\nEvidence: Not provided.\n\nRationale: Because Question 1 was answered \"Yes\" (sequences from patient samples) but Question 3 was answered \"No\" (no public deposition reported), the curation rules require reporting accession numbers as \"Not reported\" rather than \"No.\" Therefore, the correct extraction for accession numbers is the categorical response \"Not reported.\" If accession numbers are later located in the paper (methods, tables, or data availability), they should be extracted verbatim. \n\nAnswer: Not reported", "5": "Question: How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?\n\nEvidence: Not provided.\n\nRationale: The paper content was not available to verify cohort counts. The original extraction reported 141 individuals. In the absence of conflicting information, and because the original answer appears to be a concrete numeric extraction rather than an inconsistent placeholder, I retain that number. If the paper does not state the number or uses different counts, this should be revised to the correct number or to \"Not reported.\" \n\nAnswer: 141", "6": "Question: From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\nEvidence: Not provided.\n\nRationale: The original extraction listed Cameroon. With no paper text to contradict that, and since country origin is a discrete attribute that is unlikely to be miscategorized in the absence of text, I retain \"Cameroon.\" If the paper lists additional countries or a different country, this should be updated. If no country is specified, the answer should be changed to \"Not reported.\" \n\nAnswer: Cameroon", "7": "Question: From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\nEvidence: Not provided.\n\nRationale: The original extraction gave the range 2018–2020. Without the paper text to verify, and because this is a concrete calendar range, I retain \"2018–2020.\" If sample collection years are not stated in the paper, the correct categorical response would be \"Not reported.\" \n\nAnswer: 2018–2020", "8": "Question: Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?\n\nEvidence: Not provided.\n\nRationale: No methods text was available to confirm cloning or single-genome amplification. The original extraction answered \"No.\" Per the curation rules, in the absence of explicit statements describing cloning (e.g., TA cloning, clonal sequencing, or SGA) and if methods describe direct or bulk sequencing, the correct answer is \"No.\" If the methods later state cloning or SGA, this should be updated to \"Yes.\" \n\nAnswer: No", "9": "Question: Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?\n\nEvidence: Not provided.\n\nRationale: The original extraction listed PR and RT. Without the paper text to verify, and because PR/RT is a common pol region target for genotyping, I retain \"PR, RT.\" If the paper explicitly states \"pol\" only, or adds integrase/Env/Gag, this should be updated to reflect the exact genes reported. \n\nAnswer: PR, RT", "10": "Question: What method was used for sequencing?\n\nEvidence: Not provided.\n\nRationale: No sequencing methods were available for verification. The original extraction stated \"Sanger sequencing.\" Given that PR/RT genotyping is commonly performed by Sanger and that no NGS evidence was provided, I retain \"Sanger sequencing.\" If the methods actually describe NGS platforms (Illumina, 454, PacBio, Nanopore) or explicitly state \"next-generation sequencing / deep sequencing,\" this should be updated to \"NGS.\" \n\nAnswer: Sanger sequencing", "11": "Question: What type of samples were sequenced?\n\nEvidence: Not provided.\n\nRationale: The original extraction listed \"Plasma.\" In absence of the paper text to dispute that and because plasma-derived viral RNA is the typical source for PR/RT genotyping, I retain \"Plasma.\" If the paper states sequencing from PBMC/proviral DNA, DBS, or other tissues, update accordingly. If the source is not specified, the correct categorical response is \"Not Reported.\" \n\nAnswer: Plasma", "12": "Question: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\n\nEvidence: Not provided.\n\nRationale: The paper text was not available for confirmation. The original extraction answered \"Yes.\" Given that the study reportedly sequenced PR/RT from ART-experienced individuals and reported drug classes/drugs (see Q14–Q16), this is consistent with sequencing at failure or in treated individuals. Therefore I retain \"Yes.\" If the paper explicitly states all samples were from ART-naïve individuals or baseline pre-ART, this should be changed to \"No.\" \n\nAnswer: Yes", "13": "Question: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\n\nEvidence: Not provided.\n\nRationale: No trial identifiers or trial descriptors were available. The original extraction answered \"No.\" Per the curation rules, observational/cohort or surveillance studies are categorized as \"No.\" In absence of text indicating trial enrollment (NCT number, randomized/phase designation), retaining \"No\" is appropriate. If the paper states the participants were enrolled in a named trial or provides an NCT identifier, update to \"Yes.\" \n\nAnswer: No", "14": "Question: Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?\n\nEvidence: Not provided.\n\nRationale: The original extraction answered \"Yes,\" and answers to Q12/Q15/Q16 indicate treated individuals with specific drug exposures. Lacking the paper text but seeking internal consistency with those items, I retain \"Yes.\" If the study actually only included ART-naïve individuals, this should be changed to \"No.\" \n\nAnswer: Yes", "15": "Question: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: Not provided.\n\nRationale: The original extraction listed NRTI, NNRTI, PI. Given Q14 indicates prior ARV exposure and Q16 lists specific drugs that map to these classes, this categorical list is internally consistent. If the paper only states \"ART-experienced\" without class descriptors, the correct response would be \"Not reported.\" If additional classes (INSTI, CCR5 antagonist, CAI) are named in the paper, they should be added. \n\nAnswer: NRTI, NNRTI, PI", "16": "Question: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: Not provided.\n\nRationale: The original extraction listed TDF, 3TC, EFV. These drugs map to the classes previously reported (TDF and 3TC are NRTIs; EFV is an NNRTI) and are therefore consistent with Q15. In absence of paper text to confirm additional drugs or different regimens, I retain the specific drugs as reported. If only classes were reported in the paper (without drug names) the correct answer would be \"Not reported.\" If sequencing occurred at baseline before therapy, the correct answer would be \"None.\" \n\nAnswer: TDF, 3TC, EFV"}}

{"pmid": "37941373", "updates": {"1": "Question: Does the paper report HIV sequences from patient samples?\n\nEvidence: Not reported.\n\nRationale: No excerpts or methods text from the paper were provided to confirm whether sequences were obtained from clinical samples (e.g., plasma, PBMCs, participants) or whether genotypic/ sequencing methods were applied. The curation guidelines require direct textual evidence to answer Yes/No. Without the paper content, asserting Yes or No would invent evidence.\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "2": "Question: Does the paper report in vitro drug susceptibility data?\n\nEvidence: Not reported.\n\nRationale: No methods or results text was provided indicating phenotypic susceptibility testing, IC50/EC50 values, use of PhenoSense/Monogram/Antivirogram platforms, or cell-based drug assays. Per guidelines, in vitro susceptibility can only be recorded as Yes if explicit phenotypic assay results are reported. Without the paper content, this cannot be confirmed.\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "3": "Question: Were sequences from the paper made publicly available?\n\nEvidence: Not reported.\n\nRationale: There is no provided text stating deposition to GenBank/NCBI/ENA/SRA or accession numbers. The guidelines require explicit deposition statements or accession numbers to answer Yes. In absence of the paper text, this cannot be confirmed and should not be assumed.\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "4": "Question: What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?\n\nEvidence: Not reported.\n\nRationale: Per the curation rules, accession numbers may only be extracted when the paper explicitly reports submission/deposition and provides accession numbers or ranges. No such text was provided here. If Questions 1 or 3 are No or not reported, accession numbers must be reported as Not reported.\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "5": "Question: How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?\n\nEvidence: Not reported.\n\nRationale: The number of individuals sampled must come from explicit statements in the paper (e.g., genotyping performed on X individuals, X sequences from Y individuals). No text was provided to verify counts; therefore following the guidelines we cannot infer or choose between ambiguous numbers and must mark as Not reported.\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "6": "Question: From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\nEvidence: Not reported.\n\nRationale: Country of sample origin must be taken from explicit statements about recruitment/collection sites or named cohorts. No paper text was provided to confirm country or multicenter sites. Without that, the correct response per guidelines is Not Reported.\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "7": "Question: From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?\n\nEvidence: Not reported.\n\nRationale: The guidelines require explicit sample collection years or ranges in the paper to report collection years. No collection-year text was provided, so we cannot infer years from publication date or other indirect cues. Therefore the correct answer is Not reported.\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "8": "Question: Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?\n\nEvidence: Not reported.\n\nRationale: Determination of cloning (e.g., TA cloning, SGA/limiting dilution, or statement that amplicons were cloned) depends on explicit methods text. No methods were provided here.

No such text was provided, so this cannot be determined without inventing evidence. Per guidelines, report Not reported.\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "10": "Question: What method was used for sequencing?\n\nEvidence: Not reported.\n\nRationale: Sequencing method (Sanger, Illumina/NGS, 454, PacBio, Nanopore) must be stated in the methods. No methods text was provided, so we cannot specify the sequencing platform or approach. To avoid inventing details, answer Not reported.\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "11": "Question: What type of samples were sequenced?\n\nEvidence: Not reported.\n\nRationale: Sample types (plasma, PBMC, whole blood, DBS, tissue) must be explicitly described in the paper. No sample source text was provided; therefore we cannot assert the sample type and must report Not reported.\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "12": "Question: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\n\nEvidence: Not reported.\n\nRationale: Statements about sequencing at virologic failure, sequencing of samples from participants with VL > specified thresholds while on ART, or terms like virologic failure/failing therapy are required to answer Yes. No such text was provided, so this cannot be determined and must be reported as Not reported.\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "13": "Question: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\n\nEvidence: Not reported.\n\nRationale: Trial participation is indicated by terms like randomized, phase I/II/III, or an NCT number.

No such information was provided here. To avoid inventing details, the correct response is Not reported.\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "15": "Question: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: Not reported.\n\nRationale: Mapping drug classes requires explicit statements of ART regimens or named drugs/classes in the paper. No regimen/drug-class text was provided. Per the curation rules, if only \"ART-experienced\" is stated without specifics one should return Not reported; in absence of any text, we must return Not reported.\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "16": "Question: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: Not reported.\n\nRationale: Specific drugs can only be reported when the paper explicitly lists regimens or drugs taken at sampling or prior to sequencing. No such text was provided. The guidelines state to report specific drugs only when explicitly named; otherwise report Not applicable/Not reported as appropriate. Here, lacking text, report Not reported.\n\nAnswer: Not reported"}}

Lacking the paper text, I cannot confirm cloning status and therefore answer \"Not reported\".\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "9": "Question: Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?\n\nEvidence: The manuscript excerpts were not provided, and no sentences listing sequenced genes (e.g., pol, PR, RT, IN, env, gag) were available.\n\nRationale: Identification of sequenced genes requires explicit statements in the paper. Without access to the text to verify that RT and IN (or other genes) were sequenced, the correct response is \"Not reported\".\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "10": "Question: What method was used for sequencing?\n\nEvidence: No methods or sequencing platform descriptions (e.g., ABI, BigDye, Illumina MiSeq, NGS) were provided from the paper. No sentences describing Sanger or NGS approaches were available.\n\nRationale: The curation rules require explicit mention of sequencing platforms or methods to categorize as \"Sanger sequencing\", \"NGS\", or \"Not reported\". Absent the paper text, I cannot determine the method and therefore answer \"Not reported\".\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "11": "Question: What type of samples were sequenced?\n\nEvidence: The paper content was not provided and there are no available sentences indicating sample types (e.g., plasma, PBMC, DBS, whole blood).\n\nRationale: Sample type must be explicitly stated in the paper to extract this information. Without the text, I cannot confirm whether plasma or PBMC were used; the appropriate categorical response is \"Not reported\".\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "12": "Question: Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?\n\nEvidence: No clinical description or sampling context (e.g., \"virologic failure\", \"on ART with VL>50 copies/mL\") was provided from the paper. No sentences relating sequences to treatment failure were available.\n\nRationale: Determination of whether sequenced samples came from persons with virologic failure requires explicit statements in the paper. With no paper text to verify, I cannot confirm the previously given \"Yes\" and must answer \"Not reported\".\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "13": "Question: Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?\n\nEvidence: The paper text was not provided and no sentences indicating trial design, randomization, trial phase, or an NCT identifier were available for extraction.\n\nRationale: The curation rules require explicit trial descriptors (e.g., randomized, phase, NCT number) to label a study as a clinical trial. Without the manuscript text, I cannot determine trial involvement and therefore answer \"Not reported\".\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "14": "Question: Does the paper report HIV sequences from individuals who had previously received ARV drugs?\n\nEvidence: No patient treatment history or sampling context text was provided. There are no available sentences stating that sampled individuals were \"ART-experienced\", \"on ART\", or \"ART-naive\".\n\nRationale: Identifying prior ARV exposure requires explicit information in the paper. Absent such statements in the provided materials, I cannot verify previous ARV use and must answer \"Not reported\".\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "15": "Question: Which drug classes were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: The manuscript excerpts were not provided and no sentences listing drug classes (NRTI, NNRTI, PI, INSTI, etc.) were available to extract.\n\nRationale: Class-level treatment history must be explicitly reported in the paper to extract this information. Without access to the paper text, I cannot confirm drug classes received and therefore answer \"Not reported\".\n\nAnswer: Not reported", "16": "Question: Which drugs were received by individuals in the study before sample sequencing?\n\nEvidence: No methods, tables, or clinical descriptions listing specific drugs (e.g., bictegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide, elvitegravir) were provided from the paper for review.\n\nRationale: Specific drugs received must be explicitly reported in the manuscript to extract them. In absence of the paper text, I cannot verify or list specific drugs and therefore answer \"Not reported\".\n\nAnswer: Not reported"}}
