All materials will be made available upon request.", "Rationale": "The data availability statement indicates data are in the paper/Supplementary Materials and available on request, and there is no mention of deposition of sequences in public databases (e.g., GenBank) or listing of accession numbers."}, "Question 4": {"Question": "What were the GenBank accession numbers for sequenced HIV isolates?", "Answer": "None are provided in the paper; no GenBank accession numbers are reported.", "Evidence": "At the indicated time points, genomic DNA was extracted from infected cells using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Minikit (Qiagen), and the Gag-, Pol-, Env-, and Nef-coding regions were amplified by PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara Bio) and sequenced (Psomagen or Poochon Scientific) using previously described primers. All data needed to evaluate the conclusions in the paper are present in the paper and/or the Supplementary Materials. All materials will be made available upon request.", "Rationale": "While the methods describe sequencing and the service providers used, the paper does not list any GenBank or other public database accession numbers; the data availability statement likewise does not indicate public deposition."}, "Question 5": {"Question": "How many individuals had samples obtained for HIV sequencing?", "Answer": "Zero individuals; sequencing was performed on virus propagated in cell culture rather than samples from human individuals.", "Evidence": "To identify the genetic changes in the viral genome responsible for DTG resistance, we extracted genomic DNA from the infected cells at a number of time points and performed sequencing analysis of gag, pol, env, and vpu. We infected the SupT1 T cell line with the HIV-1 NL4-3 clone and serially propagated the virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of DTG.", "Rationale": "Sequencing material came from infected cell cultures and experimentally propagated viral clones; there is no description of obtaining clinical specimens from human participants."}, "Question 6": {"Question": "From which countries were the sequenced samples obtained?", "Answer": "Not applicable — sequences were from laboratory and experimentally propagated viral strains in cell culture, not from human subjects in specific countries.", "Evidence": "The NL4-3 strain used in the experiments described above is a laboratory-adapted, subtype B, CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolate. The full-length HIV-1 molecular clones pNL4-3, pNL(AD8), and CH185 (previously denoted K3016, a gift from C. Ochsenbauer and J. Kappes, University of Alabama) were used in this study.", "Rationale": "The paper describes use of laboratory clones and an externally sourced transmitted/founder clone but does not report country-of-origin information for patient samples because no patient-derived sequences were reported."}, "Question 7": {"Question": "From what years were the sequenced samples obtained?", "Answer": "Not applicable / not reported. The paper reports durations of in vitro passaging (e.g., 'nearly 1 year') but does not report calendar years of sample collection.", "Evidence": "After nearly 1 year of continuous passaging, we were able to increase the DTG concentration to 4.0 μM, which is >1000-fold the IC50. All data needed to evaluate the conclusions in the paper are present in the paper and/or the Supplementary Materials.", "Rationale": "The study describes experimental timelines (duration of passaging) but provides no calendar years for when sequences were obtained; no collection years for clinical samples are reported because no patient samples were sequenced."}, "Question 8": {"Question": "Were samples cloned prior to sequencing?", "Answer": "Both approaches were used: bulk sequencing of PCR amplicons from genomic DNA was performed, and env amplicons were cloned into plasmids to construct infectious molecular clones which were then Sanger-sequenced/verified.", "Evidence": "At the indicated time points, genomic DNA was extracted from infected cells ... and the Gag-, Pol-, Env-, and Nef-coding regions were amplified by PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara Bio) and sequenced (Psomagen or Poochon Scientific) using previously described primers.

Constructed plasmids were verified by Sanger DNA sequencing (Psomagen).", "Rationale": "The methods state that genomic regions were PCR-amplified and sequenced (bulk amplicon sequencing), and for construction of molecular clones env amplicons were cloned into proviral plasmids which were then Sanger sequenced to verify constructs."}, "Question 9": {"Question": "Which HIV genes were reported to have been sequenced?", "Answer": "gag, pol (including RT and IN regions), env, vpu, and nef (regions of Gag, Pol, Env, Vpu, and Nef were amplified/sequenced); specific focus on NC (within Gag), RT, and IN mutations is reported.", "Evidence": "To identify the genetic changes in the viral genome responsible for DTG resistance, we extracted genomic DNA from the infected cells at a number of time points and performed sequencing analysis of gag, pol, env, and vpu. At the indicated time points, genomic DNA was extracted from infected cells ... and the Gag-, Pol-, Env-, and Nef-coding regions were amplified by PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara Bio) and sequenced (Psomagen or Poochon Scientific).", "Rationale": "The Results and Methods explicitly list gag, pol, env, vpu and nef regions as targets of sequencing, and the text discusses mutations within NC (part of Gag), RT, and IN (parts of Pol), confirming those genes/regions were sequenced and analyzed."}, "Question 10": {"Question": "What method was used for sequencing?", "Answer": "Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons performed by commercial sequencing providers (Psomagen or Poochon Scientific); constructed plasmids were verified by Sanger DNA sequencing.", "Evidence": "At the indicated time points, genomic DNA was extracted from infected cells ... and the Gag-, Pol-, Env-, and Nef-coding regions were amplified by PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara Bio) and sequenced (Psomagen or Poochon Scientific) using previously described primers. Constructed plasmids were verified by Sanger DNA sequencing (Psomagen).", "Rationale": "The Methods describe PCR amplification of viral coding regions and sequencing by named sequencing services, and explicitly state that plasmids were verified by Sanger sequencing, indicating Sanger sequencing of amplicons/constructs was used."}, "Question 11": {"Question": "What type of samples were sequenced?", "Answer": "Genomic DNA extracted from infected cell cultures (infected SupT1 or SupT1huR5 cells) and PCR amplicons derived from those cultures; env amplicons were cloned into plasmids and sequenced/verified.", "Evidence": "To identify the genetic changes in the viral genome responsible for DTG resistance, we extracted genomic DNA from the infected cells at a number of time points and performed sequencing analysis of gag, pol, env, and vpu.

For 7XEnv*, the entire env region was amplified from genomic DNA from NL4-3–infected cells ... The chimeric env amplicon was cloned into pNL4-3.", "Rationale": "The paper repeatedly states sequencing was performed on genomic DNA from experimentally infected cell lines and on amplicons derived from those cultures, and that env amplicons were cloned into plasmids for construct verification."}, "Question 12": {"Question": "Were any sequences obtained from individuals with virological failure on a treatment regimen?", "Answer": "No. The study did not report sequencing of samples from individuals with virological failure; analyses were performed on viruses passaged in vitro under drug pressure.", "Evidence": "To investigate how HIV-1 develops high-level resistance to INSTIs, we infected the SupT1 T cell line with the HIV-1 NL4-3 clone ... and serially propagated the virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of DTG. A number of studies have reported INSTI failure in people living with HIV in the absence of drug resistance mutations in IN. However, systematic evaluation of Env and NC mutations in these individuals has not been conducted.", "Rationale": "All sequencing described derives from in vitro passaging experiments; the paper explicitly notes that analysis of patient-derived material has not been conducted in this study."}, "Question 13": {"Question": "Were the patients in the study in a clinical trial?", "Answer": "No — there were no patients in this study; experiments used cell lines and laboratory/primary viral clones.", "Evidence": "To investigate how HIV-1 develops high-level resistance to INSTIs, we infected the SupT1 T cell line with the HIV-1 NL4-3 clone ... and serially propagated the virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of DTG.
